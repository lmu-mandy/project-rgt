              "\"First Citizen : Before we proceed any further hear me speak <eos> All : Speak speak <eos> First Citizen : You are all resolved rather to die than to famish <eos> All : Resolved <eos> resolved <eos> First Citizen : First you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people <eos> All : We know't we know't <eos> First Citizen : Let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price <eos> Is't a verdict <eos> All : No more talking on't let it be done : away away <eos> Second Citizen : One word good citizens <eos> First Citizen : We are accounted poor citizens the patricians good <eos> What authority surfeits on would relieve us : if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear : the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes : for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge <eos> Second Citizen : Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius <eos> All : Against him first : he's a very dog to the commonalty <eos> Second Citizen : Consider you what services he has done for his country <eos> First Citizen : Very well and could be content to give him good report fort but that he pays himself with being proud <eos> Second Citizen : Nay but speak not maliciously <eos> First Citizen : I say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end : though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even till the altitude of his virtue <eos> Second Citizen : What he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him <eos> You must in no way say he is covetous <eos> First Citizen : If I must not I need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition <eos> What shouts are these <eos> The other side o' the city is risen : why stay we prating here <eos> to the Capitol <eos> All : Come come <eos> First Citizen : Soft <eos> who comes here <eos> Second Citizen : Worthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always loved the people <eos> First Citizen : He's one honest enough : would all the rest were so <eos> MENENIUS : What work's my countrymen in hand <eos> where go you With bats and clubs <eos> The matter <eos> speak I pray you <eos> First Citizen : Our business is not unknown to the senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we'll show 'em in deeds <eos> They say poor suitors have strong breaths : they shall know we have strong arms too <eos> MENENIUS : Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours Will you undo yourselves <eos> First Citizen : We cannot sir we are undone already <eos> MENENIUS : I tell you friends most charitable care Have the patricians of you <eos> For your wants Your suffering in this dearth you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state whose course will on The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs Of more strong link asunder than can ever Appear in your impediment <eos> For the dearth The gods not the patricians make it and Your knees to them not arms must help <eos> Alack You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you and you slander The helms o' the state who care for you like fathers When you curse them as enemies <eos> First Citizen : Care for us <eos> True indeed <eos> They ne'er cared for us yet : suffer us to famish and their store-houses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor <eos> If the wars eat us not up they will and there's all the love they bear us <eos> MENENIUS : Either you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious Or be accused of folly <eos> I shall tell you A pretty tale : it may be you have heard it But since it serves my purpose I will venture To stale 't a little more <eos> First Citizen : Well I'll hear it sir : yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale : but an 't please you deliver <eos> MENENIUS : There was a time when all the body's members Rebell'd against the belly thus accused it : That only like a gulf it did remain I' the midst o' the body idle and unactive Still cupboarding the viand never bearing Like labour with the rest where the other instruments Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel And mutually participate did minister Unto the appetite and affection common Of the whole body <eos> The belly answer'd <eos> First Citizen : Well sir what answer made the belly <eos> MENENIUS : Sir I shall tell you <eos> With a kind of smile Which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus <eos> For look you I may make the belly smile As well as speak <eos>it tauntingly replied To the discontented members the mutinous parts That envied his receipt even so most fitly As you malign our senators for that They are not such as you <eos> First Citizen : Your belly's answer <eos> What <eos> The kingly-crowned head the vigilant eye The counsellor heart the arm our soldier Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter <eos> With other muniments and petty helps In this our fabric if that they <eos> MENENIUS : What then <eos> 'Fore me this fellow speaks <eos> What then <eos> what then <eos> First Citizen : Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd Who is the sink o' the body <eos> MENENIUS : Well what then <eos> First Citizen : The former agents if they did complain What could the belly answer <eos> MENENIUS : I will tell you If you'll bestow a small <eos>of what you have little <eos> Patience awhile you'll hear the belly's answer <eos> First Citizen : Ye're long about it <eos> MENENIUS : Note me this good friend Your most grave belly was deliberate Not rash like his accusers and thus answer'd : 'True is it my incorporate friends' quoth he 'That I receive the general food at first Which you do live upon and fit it is Because I am the store-house and the shop Of the whole body : but if you do remember I send it through the rivers of your blood Even to the court the heart to the seat o' the brain And through the cranks and offices of man The strongest nerves and small inferior veins From me receive that natural competency Whereby they live : and though that all at once You my good friends' <eos>this says the belly mark me <eos> First Citizen : Ay sir well well <eos> MENENIUS : 'Though all at once cannot See what I do deliver out to each Yet I can make my audit up that all From me do back receive the flour of all And leave me but the bran <eos>' What say you to't <eos> First Citizen : It was an answer : how apply you this <eos> MENENIUS : The senators of Rome are this good belly And you the mutinous members for examine Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly Touching the weal o' the common you shall find No public benefit which you receive But it proceeds or comes from them to you And no way from yourselves <eos> What do you think You the great toe of this assembly <eos> First Citizen : I the great toe <eos> why the great toe <eos> MENENIUS : For that being one o' the lowest basest poorest Of this most wise rebellion thou go'st foremost : Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run Lead'st first to win some vantage <eos> But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs : Rome and her rats are at the point of battle The one side must have bale <eos> Hail noble Marcius <eos> MARCIUS : Thanks <eos> What's the matter you dissentious rogues That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion Make yourselves scabs <eos> First Citizen : We have ever your good word <eos> MARCIUS : He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring <eos> What would you have you curs That like nor peace nor war <eos> the one affrights you The other makes you proud <eos> He that trusts to you Where he should find you lions finds you hares Where foxes geese : you are no surer no Than is the coal of fire upon the ice Or hailstone in the sun <eos> Your virtue is To make him worthy whose offence subdues him And curse that justice did it <eos> Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate and your affections are A sick man's appetite who desires most that Which would increase his evil <eos> He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes <eos> Hang ye <eos> Trust Ye <eos> With every minute you do change a mind And call him noble that was now your hate Him vile that was your garland <eos> What's the matter That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble senate who Under the gods keep you in awe which else Would feed on one another <eos> What's their seeking <eos> MENENIUS : For corn at their own rates whereof they say The city is well stored <eos> MARCIUS : Hang 'em <eos> They say <eos> They'll sit by the fire and presume to know What's done i' the Capitol who's like to rise Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out Conjectural marriages making parties strong And feebling such as stand not in their liking Below their cobbled shoes <eos> They say there's grain enough <eos> Would the nobility lay aside their ruth And let me use my sword I'll make a quarry With thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high As I could pick my lance <eos> MENENIUS : Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded For though abundantly they lack discretion Yet are they passing cowardly <eos> But I beseech you What says the other troop <eos> MARCIUS : They are dissolved : hang 'em <eos> They said they were an-hungry sigh'd forth proverbs That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only : with these shreds They vented their complainings which being answer'd And a petition granted them a strange one <eos> To break the heart of generosity And make bold power look pale <eos>they threw their caps As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon Shouting their emulation <eos> MENENIUS : What is granted them <eos> MARCIUS : Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms Of their own choice : one's Junius Brutus Sicinius Velutus and I know not <eos>'Sdeath <eos> The rabble should have first unroof'd the city Ere so prevail'd with me : it will in time Win upon power and throw forth greater themes For insurrection's arguing <eos> MENENIUS : This is strange <eos> MARCIUS : Go get you home you fragments <eos> Messenger : Where's Caius Marcius <eos> MARCIUS : Here : what's the matter <eos> Messenger : The news is sir the Volsces are in arms <eos> MARCIUS : I am glad on 't : then we shall ha' means to vent Our musty superfluity <eos> See our best elders <eos> First Senator : Marcius 'tis true that you have lately told us The Volsces are in arms <eos> MARCIUS : They have a leader Tullus Aufidius that will put you to 't <eos> I sin in envying his nobility And were I any thing but what I am I would wish me only he <eos> COMINIUS : You have fought together <eos> MARCIUS : Were half to half the world by the ears and he <eos> Upon my party I'ld revolt to make Only my wars with him : he is a lion That I am proud to hunt <eos> First Senator : Then worthy Marcius Attend upon Cominius to these wars <eos> COMINIUS : It is your former promise <eos> MARCIUS : Sir it is And I am constant <eos> Titus Lartius thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face <eos> What art thou stiff <eos> stand'st out <eos> TITUS : No Caius Marcius I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other Ere stay behind this business <eos> MENENIUS : O true-bred <eos> First Senator : Your company to the Capitol where I know Our greatest friends attend us <eos> TITUS : COMINIUS : Noble Marcius <eos> First Senator : MARCIUS : Nay let them follow : The Volsces have much corn take these rats thither To gnaw their garners <eos> Worshipful mutiners Your valour puts well forth : pray follow <eos> SICINIUS : Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius <eos> BRUTUS : He has no equal <eos> SICINIUS : When we were chosen tribunes for the people <eos> BRUTUS : Mark'd you his lip and eyes <eos> SICINIUS : Nay <eos> but his taunts <eos> BRUTUS : Being moved he will not spare to gird the gods <eos> SICINIUS : Be-mock the modest moon <eos> BRUTUS : The present wars devour him : he is grown Too proud to be so valiant <eos> SICINIUS : Such a nature Tickled with good success disdains the shadow Which he treads on at noon : but I do wonder His insolence can brook to be commanded Under Cominius <eos> BRUTUS : Fame at the which he aims In whom already he's well graced can not Better be held nor more attain'd than by A place below the first : for what miscarries Shall be the general's fault though he perform To the utmost of a man and giddy censure Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he Had borne the business <eos>' SICINIUS : Besides if things go well Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall Of his demerits rob Cominius <eos> BRUTUS : Come : Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius <eos> Though Marcius earned them not and all his faults To Marcius shall be honours though indeed In aught he merit not <eos> SICINIUS : Let's hence and hear How the dispatch is made and in what fashion More than his singularity he goes Upon this present action <eos> BRUTUS : Lets along <eos> First Senator : So your opinion is Aufidius That they of Rome are entered in our counsels And know how we proceed <eos> AUFIDIUS : Is it not yours <eos> What ever have been thought on in this state That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome Had circumvention <eos> 'Tis not four days gone Since I heard thence these are the words : I think I have the letter here yes here it is <eos> 'They have press'd a power but it is not known Whether for east or west : the dearth is great The people mutinous and it is rumour'd Cominius Marcius your old enemy Who is of Rome worse hated than of you And Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman These three lead on this preparation Whither 'tis bent : most likely 'tis for you : Consider of it <eos>' First Senator : Our army's in the field We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready To answer us <eos> AUFIDIUS : Nor did you think it folly To keep your great pretences veil'd till when They needs must show themselves which in the hatching It seem'd appear'd to Rome <eos> By the discovery <eos> We shall be shorten'd in our aim which was To take in many towns ere almost Rome Should know we were afoot <eos> Second Senator : Noble Aufidius Take your commission hie you to your bands : Let us alone to guard Corioli : If they set down before 's for the remove Bring your army but I think you'll find They've not prepared for us <eos> AUFIDIUS : O doubt not that I speak from certainties <eos> Nay more Some parcels of their power are forth already And only hitherward <eos> I leave your honours <eos> If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike Till one can do no more <eos> All : The gods assist you <eos> AUFIDIUS : And keep your honours safe <eos> First Senator : Farewell <eos> Second Senator : Farewell <eos> All : Farewell <eos> VOLUMNIA : I pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort : if my son were my husband I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love <eos> When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding I considering how honour would become such a person <eos> that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame <eos> To a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak <eos> I tell thee daughter I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man <eos> VIRGILIA : But had he died in the business madam how then <eos> VOLUMNIA : Then his good report should have been my son I therein would have found issue <eos> Hear me profess sincerely : had I a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action <eos> Gentlewoman : Madam the Lady Valeria is come to visit you <eos> VIRGILIA : Beseech you give me leave to retire myself <eos> VOLUMNIA : Indeed you shall not <eos> Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair As children from a bear the Volsces shunning him : Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus : 'Come on you cowards <eos> you were got in fear Though you were born in Rome :' his bloody brow With his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow Or all or lose his hire <eos> VIRGILIA : His bloody brow <eos> O Jupiter no blood <eos> VOLUMNIA : Away you fool <eos> it more becomes a man Than gilt his trophy : the breasts of Hecuba When she did suckle Hector look'd not lovelier Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood At Grecian sword contemning <eos> Tell Valeria We are fit to bid her welcome <eos> VIRGILIA : Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius <eos> VOLUMNIA : He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee And tread upon his neck <eos> VALERIA : My ladies both good day to you <eos> VOLUMNIA : Sweet madam <eos> VIRGILIA : I am glad to see your ladyship <eos> VALERIA : How do you both <eos> you are manifest house-keepers <eos> What are you sewing here <eos> A fine spot in good faith <eos> How does your little son <eos> VIRGILIA : I thank your ladyship well good madam <eos> VOLUMNIA : He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his school-master <eos> VALERIA : O' my word the father's son : I'll swear'tis a very pretty boy <eos> O' my troth I looked upon him o' Wednesday half an hour together : has such a confirmed countenance <eos> I saw him run after a gilded butterfly : and when he caught it he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes and again catched it again or whether his fall enraged him or how 'twas he did so set his teeth and tear it O I warrant it how he mammocked it <eos> VOLUMNIA : One on 's father's moods <eos> VALERIA : Indeed la 'tis a noble child <eos> VIRGILIA : A crack madam <eos> VALERIA : Come lay aside your stitchery I must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon <eos> VIRGILIA : No good madam I will not out of doors <eos> VALERIA : Not out of doors <eos> VOLUMNIA : She shall she shall <eos> VIRGILIA : Indeed no by your patience I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars <eos> VALERIA : Fie you confine yourself most unreasonably : come you must go visit the good lady that lies in <eos> VIRGILIA : I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers but I cannot go thither <eos> VOLUMNIA : Why I pray you <eos> VIRGILIA : 'Tis not to save labour nor that I want love <eos> VALERIA : You would be another Penelope : yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths <eos> Come I would your cambric were sensible as your finger that you might leave pricking it for pity <eos> Come you shall go with us <eos> VIRGILIA : No good madam pardon me indeed I will not forth <eos> VALERIA : In truth la go with me and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband <eos> VIRGILIA : O good madam there can be none yet <eos> VALERIA : Verily I do not jest with you there came news from him last night <eos> VIRGILIA : Indeed madam <eos> VALERIA : In earnest it's true I heard a senator speak it <eos> Thus it is : the Volsces have an army forth against whom Cominius the general is gone with one part of our Roman power : your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars <eos> This is true on mine honour and so I pray go with us <eos> VIRGILIA : Give me excuse good madam I will obey you in every thing hereafter <eos> VOLUMNIA : Let her alone lady : as she is now she will but disease our better mirth <eos> VALERIA : In troth I think she would <eos> Fare you well then <eos> Come good sweet lady <eos> Prithee Virgilia turn thy solemness out o' door <eos> and go along with us <eos> VIRGILIA : No at a word madam indeed I must not <eos> I wish you much mirth <eos> VALERIA : Well then farewell <eos> MARCIUS : Yonder comes news <eos> A wager they have met <eos> LARTIUS : My horse to yours no <eos> MARCIUS : 'Tis done <eos> LARTIUS : Agreed <eos> MARCIUS : Say has our general met the enemy <eos> Messenger : They lie in view but have not spoke as yet <eos> LARTIUS : So the good horse is mine <eos> MARCIUS : I'll buy him of you <eos> LARTIUS : No I'll nor sell nor give him : lend you him I will For half a hundred years <eos> Summon the town <eos> MARCIUS : How far off lie these armies <eos> Messenger : Within this mile and half <eos> MARCIUS : Then shall we hear their 'larum and they ours <eos> Now Mars I prithee make us quick in work That we with smoking swords may march from hence To help our fielded friends <eos> Come blow thy blast <eos> Tutus Aufidius is he within your walls <eos> First Senator : No nor a man that fears you less than he That's lesser than a little <eos> Hark <eos> our drums Are bringing forth our youth <eos> We'll break our walls Rather than they shall pound us up : our gates Which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes They'll open of themselves <eos> Hark you <eos> far off <eos> There is Aufidius list what work he makes Amongst your cloven army <eos> MARCIUS : O they are at it <eos> LARTIUS : Their noise be our instruction <eos> Ladders ho <eos> MARCIUS : They fear us not but issue forth their city <eos> Now put your shields before your hearts and fight With hearts more proof than shields <eos> Advance brave Titus : They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts Which makes me sweat with wrath <eos> Come on my fellows : He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce And he shall feel mine edge <eos> MARCIUS : All the contagion of the south light on you You shames of Rome <eos> you herd of <eos>Boils and plagues Plaster you o'er that you may be abhorr'd Further than seen and one infect another Against the wind a mile <eos> You souls of geese That bear the shapes of men how have you run From slaves that apes would beat <eos> Pluto and hell <eos> All hurt behind backs red and faces pale With flight and agued fear <eos> Mend and charge home Or by the fires of heaven I'll leave the foe And make my wars on you : look to't : come on If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives As they us to our trenches followed <eos> So now the gates are ope : now prove good seconds : 'Tis for the followers fortune widens them Not for the fliers : mark me and do the like <eos> First Soldier : Fool-hardiness not I <eos> Second Soldier : Nor I <eos> First Soldier : See they have shut him in <eos> All : To the pot I warrant him <eos> LARTIUS : What is become of Marcius <eos> All : Slain sir doubtless <eos> First Soldier : Following the fliers at the very heels With them he enters who upon the sudden Clapp'd to their gates : he is himself alone To answer all the city <eos> LARTIUS : O noble fellow <eos> Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword And when it bows stands up <eos> Thou art left Marcius : A carbuncle entire as big as thou art Were not so rich a jewel <eos> Thou wast a soldier Even to Cato's wish not fierce and terrible Only in strokes but with thy grim looks and The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds Thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world Were feverous and did tremble <eos> First Soldier : Look sir <eos> LARTIUS : O'tis Marcius <eos> Let's fetch him off or make remain alike <eos> First Roman : This will I carry to Rome <eos> Second Roman : And I this <eos> Third Roman : A murrain on't <eos> I took this for silver <eos> MARCIUS : See here these movers that do prize their hours At a crack'd drachm <eos> Cushions leaden spoons Irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would Bury with those that wore them these base slaves Ere yet the fight be done pack up : down with them <eos> And hark what noise the general makes <eos> To him <eos> There is the man of my soul's hate Aufidius Piercing our Romans : then valiant Titus take Convenient numbers to make good the city Whilst I with those that have the spirit will haste To help Cominius <eos> LARTIUS : Worthy sir thou bleed'st Thy exercise hath been too violent for A second course of fight <eos> MARCIUS : Sir praise me not My work hath yet not warm'd me : fare you well : The blood I drop is rather physical Than dangerous to me : to Aufidius thus I will appear and fight <eos> LARTIUS : Now the fair goddess Fortune Fall deep in love with thee and her great charms Misguide thy opposers' swords <eos> Bold gentleman Prosperity be thy page <eos> MARCIUS : Thy friend no less Than those she placeth highest <eos> So farewell <eos> LARTIUS : Thou worthiest Marcius <eos> Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place Call thither all the officers o' the town Where they shall know our mind : away <eos> COMINIUS : Breathe you my friends : well fought we are come off Like Romans neither foolish in our stands Nor cowardly in retire : believe me sirs We shall be charged again <eos> Whiles we have struck By interims and conveying gusts we have heard The charges of our friends <eos> Ye Roman gods <eos> Lead their successes as we wish our own That both our powers with smiling fronts encountering May give you thankful sacrifice <eos> Thy news <eos> Messenger : The citizens of Corioli have issued And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle : I saw our party to their trenches driven And then I came away <eos> COMINIUS : Though thou speak'st truth Methinks thou speak'st not well <eos> How long is't since <eos> Messenger : Above an hour my lord <eos> COMINIUS : 'Tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums : How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour And bring thy news so late <eos> Messenger : Spies of the Volsces Held me in chase that I was forced to wheel Three or four miles about else had I sir Half an hour since brought my report <eos> COMINIUS : Who's yonder That does appear as he were flay'd <eos> O gods He has the stamp of Marcius and I have Before-time seen him thus <eos> MARCIUS : COMINIUS : The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue From every meaner man <eos> MARCIUS : Come I too late <eos> COMINIUS : Ay if you come not in the blood of others But mantled in your own <eos> MARCIUS : O let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I woo'd in heart As merry as when our nuptial day was done And tapers burn'd to bedward <eos> COMINIUS : Flower of warriors How is it with Titus Lartius <eos> MARCIUS : As with a man busied about decrees : Condemning some to death and some to exile Ransoming him or pitying threatening the other Holding Corioli in the name of Rome Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash To let him slip at will <eos> COMINIUS : Where is that slave Which told me they had beat you to your trenches <eos> Where is he <eos> call him hither <eos> MARCIUS : Let him alone He did inform the truth : but for our gentlemen The common file <eos>a plague <eos> tribunes for them <eos> <eos> The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge From rascals worse than they <eos> COMINIUS : But how prevail'd you <eos> MARCIUS : Will the time serve to tell <eos> I do not think <eos> Where is the enemy <eos> are you lords o' the field <eos> If not why cease you till you are so <eos> COMINIUS : Marcius We have at disadvantage fought and did Retire to win our purpose <eos> MARCIUS : How lies their battle <eos> know you on which side They have placed their men of trust <eos> COMINIUS : As I guess Marcius Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates Of their best trust o'er them Aufidius Their very heart of hope <eos> MARCIUS : I do beseech you By all the battles wherein we have fought By the blood we have shed together by the vows We have made to endure friends that you directly Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates And that you not delay the present but Filling the air with swords advanced and darts We prove this very hour <eos> COMINIUS : Though I could wish You were conducted to a gentle bath And balms applied to you yet dare I never Deny your asking : take your choice of those That best can aid your action <eos> MARCIUS : Those are they That most are willing <eos> If any such be here <eos> As it were sin to doubt <eos>that love this painting Wherein you see me smear'd if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report If any think brave death outweighs bad life And that his country's dearer than himself Let him alone or so many so minded Wave thus to express his disposition And follow Marcius <eos> O me alone <eos> make you a sword of me <eos> If these shows be not outward which of you But is four Volsces <eos> none of you but is Able to bear against the great Aufidius A shield as hard as his <eos> A certain number Though thanks to all must I select from all : the rest Shall bear the business in some other fight As cause will be obey'd <eos> Please you to march And four shall quickly draw out my command Which men are best inclined <eos> COMINIUS : March on my fellows : Make good this ostentation and you shall Divide in all with us <eos> LARTIUS : So let the ports be guarded : keep your duties As I have set them down <eos> If I do send dispatch Those centuries to our aid : the rest will serve For a short holding : if we lose the field We cannot keep the town <eos> Lieutenant : Fear not our care sir <eos> LARTIUS : Hence and shut your gates upon's <eos> Our guider come to the Roman camp conduct us <eos> MARCIUS : I'll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee Worse than a promise-breaker <eos> AUFIDIUS : We hate alike : Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor More than thy fame and envy <eos> Fix thy foot <eos> MARCIUS : Let the first budger die the other's slave And the gods doom him after <eos> AUFIDIUS : If I fly Marcius Holloa me like a hare <eos> MARCIUS : Within these three hours Tullus Alone I fought in your Corioli walls And made what work I pleased : 'tis not my blood Wherein thou seest me mask'd for thy revenge Wrench up thy power to the highest <eos> AUFIDIUS : Wert thou the Hector That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny Thou shouldst not scape me here <eos> Officious and not valiant you have shamed me In your condemned seconds <eos> COMINIUS : If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds : but I'll report it Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles Where great patricians shall attend and shrug I' the end admire where ladies shall be frighted And gladly quaked hear more where the dull tribunes That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods Our Rome hath such a soldier <eos>' Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast Having fully dined before <eos> LARTIUS : O general Here is the steed we the caparison : Hadst thou beheld <eos> MARCIUS : Pray now no more : my mother Who has a charter to extol her blood When she does praise me grieves me <eos> I have done As you have done that's what I can induced As you have been that's for my country : He that has but effected his good will Hath overta'en mine act <eos> COMINIUS : You shall not be The grave of your deserving Rome must know The value of her own : 'twere a concealment Worse than a theft no less than a traducement To hide your doings and to silence that Which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd Would seem but modest : therefore I beseech you In sign of what you are not to reward What you have done <eos>before our army hear me <eos> MARCIUS : I have some wounds upon me and they smart To hear themselves remember'd <eos> COMINIUS : Should they not Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude And tent themselves with death <eos> Of all the horses Whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all The treasure in this field achieved and city We render you the tenth to be ta'en forth Before the common distribution at Your only choice <eos> MARCIUS : I thank you general But cannot make my heart consent to take A bribe to pay my sword : I do refuse it And stand upon my common part with those That have beheld the doing <eos> MARCIUS : May these same instruments which you profane Never sound more <eos> when drums and trumpets shall I' the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be Made all of false-faced soothing <eos> When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk Let him be made a coverture for the wars <eos> No more I say <eos> For that I have not wash'd My nose that bled or foil'd some debile wretch <eos> <eos> Which without note here's many else have done <eos> You shout me forth In acclamations hyperbolical As if I loved my little should be dieted In praises sauced with lies <eos> COMINIUS : Too modest are you More cruel to your good report than grateful To us that give you truly : by your patience If 'gainst yourself you be incensed we'll put you Like one that means his proper harm in manacles Then reason safely with you <eos> Therefore be it known As to us to all the world that Caius Marcius Wears this war's garland : in token of the which My noble steed known to the camp I give him With all his trim belonging and from this time For what he did before Corioli call him With all the applause and clamour of the host CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS <eos> Bear The addition nobly ever <eos> All : Caius Marcius Coriolanus <eos> CORIOLANUS : I will go wash And when my face is fair you shall perceive Whether I blush or no : howbeit I thank you <eos> I mean to stride your steed and at all times To undercrest your good addition To the fairness of my power <eos> COMINIUS : So to our tent Where ere we do repose us we will write To Rome of our success <eos> You Titus Lartius Must to Corioli back : send us to Rome The best with whom we may articulate For their own good and ours <eos> LARTIUS : I shall my lord <eos> CORIOLANUS : The gods begin to mock me <eos> I that now Refused most princely gifts am bound to beg Of my lord general <eos> COMINIUS : Take't 'tis yours <eos> What is't <eos> CORIOLANUS : I sometime lay here in Corioli At a poor man's house he used me kindly : He cried to me I saw him prisoner But then Aufidius was within my view And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity : I request you To give my poor host freedom <eos> COMINIUS : O well begg'd <eos> Were he the butcher of my son he should Be free as is the wind <eos> Deliver him Titus <eos> LARTIUS : Marcius his name <eos> CORIOLANUS : By Jupiter <eos> forgot <eos> I am weary yea my memory is tired <eos> Have we no wine here <eos> COMINIUS : Go we to our tent : The blood upon your visage dries 'tis time It should be look'd to : come <eos> AUFIDIUS : The town is ta'en <eos> First Soldier : 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition <eos> AUFIDIUS : Condition <eos> I would I were a Roman for I cannot Being a Volsce be that I am <eos> Condition <eos> What good condition can a treaty find I' the part that is at mercy <eos> Five times Marcius I have fought with thee : so often hast thou beat me And wouldst do so I think should we encounter As often as we eat <eos> By the elements If e'er again I meet him beard to beard He's mine or I am his : mine emulation Hath not that honour in't it had for where I thought to crush him in an equal force True sword to sword I'll potch at him some way Or wrath or craft may get him <eos> First Soldier : He's the devil <eos> AUFIDIUS : Bolder though not so subtle <eos> My valour's poison'd With only suffering stain by him for him Shall fly out of itself : nor sleep nor sanctuary Being naked sick nor fane nor Capitol The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice Embarquements all of fury shall lift up Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst My hate to Marcius : where I find him were it At home upon my brother's guard even there Against the hospitable canon would I Wash my fierce hand in's heart <eos> Go you to the city Learn how 'tis held and what they are that must Be hostages for Rome <eos> First Soldier : Will not you go <eos> AUFIDIUS : I am attended at the cypress grove : I pray you <eos> 'Tis south the city mills <eos>bring me word thither How the world goes that to the pace of it I may spur on my journey <eos> First Soldier : I shall sir <eos> MENENIUS : The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night <eos> BRUTUS : Good or bad <eos> MENENIUS : Not according to the prayer of the people for they love not Marcius <eos> SICINIUS : Nature teaches beasts to know their friends <eos> MENENIUS : Pray you who does the wolf love <eos> SICINIUS : The lamb <eos> MENENIUS : Ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius <eos> BRUTUS : He's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear <eos> MENENIUS : He's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb <eos> You two are old men : tell me one thing that I shall ask you <eos> Both : Well sir <eos> MENENIUS : In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance <eos> BRUTUS : He's poor in no one fault but stored with all <eos> SICINIUS : Especially in pride <eos> BRUTUS : And topping all others in boasting <eos> MENENIUS : This is strange now : do you two know how you are censured here in the city I mean of us o' the right-hand file <eos> do you <eos> Both : Why how are we censured <eos> MENENIUS : Because you talk of pride now <eos>will you not be angry <eos> Both : Well well sir well <eos> MENENIUS : Why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience : give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so <eos> You blame Marcius for being proud <eos> BRUTUS : We do it not alone sir <eos> MENENIUS : I know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single : your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone <eos> You talk of pride : O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves <eos> O that you could <eos> BRUTUS : What then sir <eos> MENENIUS : Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in Rome <eos> SICINIUS : Menenius you are known well enough too <eos> MENENIUS : I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning : what I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath <eos> Meeting two such wealsmen as you are <eos>I cannot call you Lycurguses <eos>if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it <eos> I can't say your worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables : and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces <eos> If you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too <eos> what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough too <eos> BRUTUS : Come sir come we know you well enough <eos> MENENIUS : You know neither me yourselves nor any thing <eos> You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs : you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience <eos> When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber-pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing : all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves <eos> You are a pair of strange ones <eos> BRUTUS : Come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol <eos> MENENIUS : Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are <eos> When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an ass's pack- saddle <eos> Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen <eos> God-den to your worships : more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians : I will be bold to take my leave of you <eos> How now my as fair as noble ladies <eos>and the moon were she earthly no nobler <eos>whither do you follow your eyes so fast <eos> VOLUMNIA : Honourable Menenius my boy Marcius approaches for the love of Juno let's go <eos> MENENIUS : Ha <eos> Marcius coming home <eos> VOLUMNIA : Ay worthy Menenius and with most prosperous approbation <eos> MENENIUS : Take my cap Jupiter and I thank thee <eos> Hoo <eos> Marcius coming home <eos> VOLUMNIA : Nay'tis true <eos> VOLUMNIA : Look here's a letter from him : the state hath another his wife another and I think there's one at home for you <eos> MENENIUS : I will make my very house reel tonight : a letter for me <eos> VIRGILIA : Yes certain there's a letter for you I saw't <eos> MENENIUS : A letter for me <eos> it gives me an estate of seven years' health in which time I will make a lip at the physician : the most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse-drench <eos> Is he not wounded <eos> he was wont to come home wounded <eos> VIRGILIA : O no no no <eos> VOLUMNIA : O he is wounded I thank the gods for't <eos> MENENIUS : So do I too if it be not too much : brings a' victory in his pocket <eos> the wounds become him <eos> VOLUMNIA : On's brows : Menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland <eos> MENENIUS : Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly <eos> VOLUMNIA : Titus Lartius writes they fought together but Aufidius got off <eos> MENENIUS : And 'twas time for him too I'll warrant him that : an he had stayed by him I would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them <eos> Is the senate possessed of this <eos> VOLUMNIA : Good ladies let's go <eos> Yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war : he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly VALERIA : In troth there's wondrous things spoke of him <eos> MENENIUS : Wondrous <eos> ay I warrant you and not without his true purchasing <eos> VIRGILIA : The gods grant them true <eos> VOLUMNIA : True <eos> pow wow <eos> MENENIUS : True <eos> I'll be sworn they are true <eos> Where is he wounded <eos> God save your good worships <eos> Marcius is coming home : he has more cause to be proud <eos> Where is he wounded <eos> VOLUMNIA : I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place <eos> He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' the body <eos> MENENIUS : One i' the neck and two i' the thigh <eos>there's nine that I know <eos> VOLUMNIA : He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds upon him <eos> MENENIUS : Now it's twenty-seven : every gash was an enemy's grave <eos> Hark <eos> the trumpets <eos> VOLUMNIA : These are the ushers of Marcius : before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears : Death that dark spirit in 's nervy arm doth lie Which being advanced declines and then men die <eos> Herald : Know Rome that all alone Marcius did fight Within Corioli gates : where he hath won With fame a name to Caius Marcius these In honour follows Coriolanus <eos> Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus <eos> All : Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus <eos> CORIOLANUS : No more of this it does offend my heart : Pray now no more <eos> COMINIUS : Look sir your mother <eos> CORIOLANUS : O You have I know petition'd all the gods For my prosperity <eos> VOLUMNIA : Nay my good soldier up My gentle Marcius worthy Caius and By deed-achieving honour newly named <eos> What is it <eos> <eos>Coriolanus must I call thee <eos> <eos> But O thy wife <eos> CORIOLANUS : My gracious silence hail <eos> Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home That weep'st to see me triumph <eos> Ay my dear Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear And mothers that lack sons <eos> MENENIUS : Now the gods crown thee <eos> CORIOLANUS : And live you yet <eos> O my sweet lady pardon <eos> VOLUMNIA : I know not where to turn : O welcome home : And welcome general : and ye're welcome all <eos> MENENIUS : A hundred thousand welcomes <eos> I could weep And I could laugh I am light and heavy <eos> Welcome <eos> A curse begin at very root on's heart That is not glad to see thee <eos> You are three That Rome should dote on : yet by the faith of men We have some old crab-trees here at home that will not Be grafted to your relish <eos> Yet welcome warriors : We call a nettle but a nettle and The faults of fools but folly <eos> COMINIUS : Ever right <eos> CORIOLANUS : Menenius ever ever <eos> Herald : Give way there and go on <eos> CORIOLANUS : VOLUMNIA : I have lived To see inherited my very wishes And the buildings of my fancy : only There's one thing wanting which I doubt not but Our Rome will cast upon thee <eos> CORIOLANUS : Know good mother I had rather be their servant in my way Than sway with them in theirs <eos> COMINIUS : On to the Capitol <eos> BRUTUS : All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights Are spectacled to see him : your prattling nurse Into a rapture lets her baby cry While she chats him : the kitchen malkin pins Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck Clambering the walls to eye him : stalls bulks windows Are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges horsed With variable complexions all agreeing In earnestness to see him : seld-shown flamens Do press among the popular throngs and puff To win a vulgar station : or veil'd dames Commit the war of white and damask in Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil Of Phoebus' burning kisses : such a pother As if that whatsoever god who leads him Were slily crept into his human powers And gave him graceful posture <eos> SICINIUS : On the sudden I warrant him consul <eos> BRUTUS : Then our office may During his power go sleep <eos> SICINIUS : He cannot temperately transport his honours From where he should begin and end but will Lose those he hath won <eos> BRUTUS : In that there's comfort <eos> SICINIUS : Doubt not The commoners for whom we stand but they Upon their ancient malice will forget With the least cause these his new honours which That he will give them make I as little question As he is proud to do't <eos> BRUTUS : I heard him swear Were he to stand for consul never would he Appear i' the market-place nor on him put The napless vesture of humility Nor showing as the manner is his wounds To the people beg their stinking breaths <eos> SICINIUS : 'Tis right <eos> BRUTUS : It was his word : O he would miss it rather Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him And the desire of the nobles <eos> SICINIUS : I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution <eos> BRUTUS : 'Tis most like he will <eos> SICINIUS : It shall be to him then as our good wills A sure destruction <eos> BRUTUS : So it must fall out To him or our authorities <eos> For an end We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them that to's power he would Have made them mules silenced their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms holding them In human action and capacity Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in the war who have their provand Only for bearing burdens and sore blows For sinking under them <eos> SICINIUS : This as you say suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the people <eos>which time shall not want If he be put upon 't and that's as easy As to set dogs on sheep <eos>will be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever <eos> BRUTUS : What's the matter <eos> Messenger : You are sent for to the Capitol <eos> 'Tis thought That Marcius shall be consul : I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and The blind to bear him speak : matrons flung gloves Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers Upon him as he pass'd : the nobles bended As to Jove's statue and the commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts : I never saw the like <eos> BRUTUS : Let's to the Capitol And carry with us ears and eyes for the time But hearts for the event <eos> SICINIUS : Have with you <eos> First Officer : Come come they are almost here <eos> How many stand for consulships <eos> Second Officer : Three they say : but 'tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it <eos> First Officer : That's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common people <eos> Second Officer : Faith there had been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore : so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground : therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't <eos> First Officer : If he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm : but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite <eos> Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love <eos> Second Officer : He hath deserved worthily of his country : and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report : but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it <eos> First Officer : No more of him he is a worthy man : make way they are coming <eos> MENENIUS : Having determined of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius it remains As the main point of this our after-meeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country : therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our well-found successes to report A little of that worthy work perform'd By Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself <eos> First Senator : Speak good Cominius : Leave nothing out for length and make us think Rather our state's defective for requital Than we to stretch it out <eos> Masters o' the people We do request your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here <eos> SICINIUS : We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly <eos> BRUTUS : Which the rather We shall be blest to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at <eos> MENENIUS : That's off that's off I would you rather had been silent <eos> Please you To hear Cominius speak <eos> BRUTUS : Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it <eos> MENENIUS : He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow <eos> Worthy Cominius speak <eos> Nay keep your place <eos> First Senator : Sit Coriolanus never shame to hear What you have nobly done <eos> CORIOLANUS : Your horror's pardon : I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them <eos> BRUTUS : Sir I hope My words disbench'd you not <eos> CORIOLANUS : No sir : yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words <eos> You soothed not therefore hurt not : but your people I love them as they weigh <eos> MENENIUS : Pray now sit down <eos> CORIOLANUS : I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monster'd <eos> MENENIUS : Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter <eos> That's thousand to one good one <eos>when you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one on's ears to hear it <eos> Proceed Cominius <eos> COMINIUS : I shall lack voice : the deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter'd feebly <eos> It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver : if it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised <eos> At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others : our then dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him : be bestrid An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view Slew three opposers : Tarquin's self he met And struck him on his knee : in that day's feats When he might act the woman in the scene He proved best man i' the field and for his meed Was brow-bound with the oak <eos> His pupil age Man-enter'd thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch'd all swords of the garland <eos> For this last Before and in Corioli let me say I cannot speak him home : he stopp'd the fliers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport : as weeds before A vessel under sail so men obey'd And fell below his stem : his sword death's stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was timed with dying cries : alone he enter'd The mortal gate of the city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioli like a planet : now all's his : When by and by the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking o'er the lives of men as if 'Twere a perpetual spoil : and till we call'd Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting <eos> MENENIUS : Worthy man <eos> First Senator : He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him <eos> COMINIUS : Our spoils he kick'd at And look'd upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world : he covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it <eos> MENENIUS : He's right noble : Let him be call'd for <eos> First Senator : Call Coriolanus <eos> Officer : He doth appear <eos> MENENIUS : The senate Coriolanus are well pleased To make thee consul <eos> CORIOLANUS : I do owe them still My life and services <eos> MENENIUS : It then remains That you do speak to the people <eos> CORIOLANUS : I do beseech you Let me o'erleap that custom for I cannot Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage : please you That I may pass this doing <eos> SICINIUS : Sir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony <eos> MENENIUS : Put them not to't : Pray you go fit you to the custom and Take to you as your predecessors have Your honour with your form <eos> CORIOLANUS : It is apart That I shall blush in acting and might well Be taken from the people <eos> BRUTUS : Mark you that <eos> CORIOLANUS : To brag unto them thus I did and thus Show them the unaching scars which I should hide As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only <eos> MENENIUS : Do not stand upon't <eos> We recommend to you tribunes of the people Our purpose to them : and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour <eos> Senators : To Coriolanus come all joy and honour <eos> BRUTUS : You see how he intends to use the people <eos> SICINIUS : May they perceive's intent <eos> He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give <eos> BRUTUS : Come we'll inform them Of our proceedings here : on the marketplace I know they do attend us <eos> First Citizen : Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him <eos> Second Citizen : We may sir if we will <eos> Third Citizen : We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them <eos> Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude : of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members <eos> First Citizen : And to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude <eos> Third Citizen : We have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured : and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' the compass <eos> Second Citizen : Think you so <eos> Which way do you judge my wit would fly <eos> Third Citizen : Nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's will'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head but if it were at liberty 'twould sure southward <eos> Second Citizen : Why that way <eos> Third Citizen : To lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife <eos> Second Citizen : You are never without your tricks : you may you may <eos> Third Citizen : Are you all resolved to give your voices <eos> But that's no matter the greater part carries it <eos> I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man <eos> Here he comes and in the gown of humility : mark his behavior <eos> We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes <eos> He's to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues : therefore follow me and I direct you how you shall go by him <eos> All : Content content <eos> MENENIUS : O sir you are not right : have you not known The worthiest men have done't <eos> CORIOLANUS : What must I say <eos> 'I Pray sir' <eos>Plague upon't <eos> I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace : <eos>'Look sir my wounds <eos> I got them in my country's service when Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran From the noise of our own drums <eos>' MENENIUS : O me the gods <eos> You must not speak of that : you must desire them To think upon you <eos> CORIOLANUS : Think upon me <eos> hang 'em <eos> I would they would forget me like the virtues Which our divines lose by 'em <eos> MENENIUS : You'll mar all : I'll leave you : pray you speak to 'em I pray you In wholesome manner <eos> CORIOLANUS : Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean <eos> So here comes a brace <eos> You know the cause air of my standing here <eos> Third Citizen : We do sir tell us what hath brought you to't <eos> CORIOLANUS : Mine own desert <eos> Second Citizen : Your own desert <eos> CORIOLANUS : Ay but not mine own desire <eos> Third Citizen : How not your own desire <eos> CORIOLANUS : No sir'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging <eos> Third Citizen : You must think if we give you any thing we hope to gain by you <eos> CORIOLANUS : Well then I pray your price o' the consulship <eos> First Citizen : The price is to ask it kindly <eos> CORIOLANUS : Kindly <eos> Sir I pray let me ha't : I have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private <eos> Your good voice sir what say you <eos> Second Citizen : You shall ha' it worthy sir <eos> CORIOLANUS : A match sir <eos> There's in all two worthy voices begged <eos> I have your alms : adieu <eos> Third Citizen : But this is something odd <eos> Second Citizen : An 'twere to give again <eos>but 'tis no matter <eos> CORIOLANUS : Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown <eos> Fourth Citizen : You have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly <eos> CORIOLANUS : Your enigma <eos> Fourth Citizen : You have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people <eos> CORIOLANUS : You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love <eos> I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle : and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers <eos> Therefore beseech you I may be consul <eos> Fifth Citizen : We hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily <eos> Fourth Citizen : You have received many wounds for your country <eos> CORIOLANUS : I will not seal your knowledge with showing them <eos> I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further <eos> Both Citizens : The gods give you joy sir heartily <eos> CORIOLANUS : Most sweet voices <eos> Better it is to die better to starve Than crave the hire which first we do deserve <eos> Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear Their needless vouches <eos> Custom calls me to't : What custom wills in all things should we do't The dust on antique time would lie unswept And mountainous error be too highly heapt For truth to o'er-peer <eos> Rather than fool it so Let the high office and the honour go To one that would do thus <eos> I am half through The one part suffer'd the other will I do <eos> Here come more voices <eos> Your voices : for your voices I have fought Watch'd for your voices for Your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six I have seen and heard of for your voices have Done many things some less some more your voices : Indeed I would be consul <eos> Sixth Citizen : He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest man's voice <eos> Seventh Citizen : Therefore let him be consul : the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people <eos> All Citizens : Amen amen <eos> God save thee noble consul <eos> CORIOLANUS : Worthy voices <eos> MENENIUS : You have stood your limitation and the tribunes Endue you with the people's voice : remains That in the official marks invested you Anon do meet the senate <eos> CORIOLANUS : Is this done <eos> SICINIUS : The custom of request you have discharged : The people do admit you and are summon'd To meet anon upon your approbation <eos> CORIOLANUS : Where <eos> at the senate-house <eos> SICINIUS : There Coriolanus <eos> CORIOLANUS : May I change these garments <eos> SICINIUS : You may sir <eos> CORIOLANUS : That I'll straight do and knowing myself again Repair to the senate-house <eos> MENENIUS : I'll keep you company <eos> Will you along <eos> BRUTUS : We stay here for the people <eos> SICINIUS : Fare you well <eos> He has it now and by his looks methink 'Tis warm at 's heart <eos> BRUTUS : With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds <eos> will you dismiss the people <eos> SICINIUS : How now my masters <eos> have you chose this man <eos> First Citizen : He has our voices sir <eos> BRUTUS : We pray the gods he may deserve your loves <eos> Second Citizen : Amen sir : to my poor unworthy notice He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices <eos> Third Citizen : Certainly He flouted us downright <eos> First Citizen : No'tis his kind of speech : he did not mock us <eos> Second Citizen : Not one amongst us save yourself but says He used us scornfully : he should have show'd us His marks of merit wounds received for's country <eos> SICINIUS : Why so he did I am sure <eos> Citizens : No no no man saw 'em <eos> Third Citizen : He said he had wounds which he could show in private And with his hat thus waving it in scorn 'I would be consul' says he : 'aged custom But by your voices will not so permit me Your voices therefore <eos>' When we granted that Here was 'I thank you for your voices : thank you : Your most sweet voices : now you have left your voices I have no further with you <eos>' Was not this mockery <eos> SICINIUS : Why either were you ignorant to see't Or seeing it of such childish friendliness To yield your voices <eos> BRUTUS : Could you not have told him As you were lesson'd when he had no power But was a petty servant to the state He was your enemy ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I' the body of the weal and now arriving A place of potency and sway o' the state If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to the plebeii your voices might Be curses to yourselves <eos> You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love Standing your friendly lord <eos> SICINIUS : Thus to have said As you were fore-advised had touch'd his spirit And tried his inclination from him pluck'd Either his gracious promise which you might As cause had call'd you up have held him to Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught so putting him to rage You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler And pass'd him unelected <eos> BRUTUS : Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush <eos> Why had your bodies No heart among you <eos> or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment <eos> SICINIUS : Have you Ere now denied the asker <eos> and now again Of him that did not ask but mock bestow Your sued-for tongues <eos> Third Citizen : He's not confirm'd we may deny him yet <eos> Second Citizen : And will deny him : I'll have five hundred voices of that sound <eos> First Citizen : I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em <eos> BRUTUS : Get you hence instantly and tell those friends They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so <eos> SICINIUS : Let them assemble And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election enforce his pride And his old hate unto you besides forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed How in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves Thinking upon his services took from you The apprehension of his present portance Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you <eos> BRUTUS : Lay A fault on us your tribunes that we laboured No impediment between but that you must Cast your election on him <eos> SICINIUS : Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections and that your minds Preoccupied with what you rather must do Than what you should made you against the grain To voice him consul : lay the fault on us <eos> BRUTUS : Ay spare us not <eos> Say we read lectures to you <eos> How youngly he began to serve his country How long continued and what stock he springs of The noble house o' the Marcians from whence came That Ancus Marcius Numa's daughter's son Who after great Hostilius here was king Of the same house Publius and Quintus were That our beat water brought by conduits hither And Twice being Was his great ancestor <eos> SICINIUS : One thus descended That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place we did commend To your remembrances : but you have found Scaling his present bearing with his past That he's your fixed enemy and revoke Your sudden approbation <eos> BRUTUS : Say you ne'er had done't <eos> Harp on that still <eos>but by our putting on And presently when you have drawn your number Repair to the Capitol <eos> All : We will so : almost all Repent in their election <eos> BRUTUS : Let them go on This mutiny were better put in hazard Than stay past doubt for greater : If as his nature is he fall in rage With their refusal both observe and answer The vantage of his anger <eos> SICINIUS : To the Capitol come : We will be there before the stream o' the people And this shall seem as partly 'tis their own Which we have goaded onward <eos> CORIOLANUS : Tullus Aufidius then had made new head <eos> LARTIUS : He had my lord and that it was which caused Our swifter composition <eos> CORIOLANUS : So then the Volsces stand but as at first Ready when time shall prompt them to make road <eos> Upon's again <eos> COMINIUS : They are worn lord consul so That we shall hardly in our ages see Their banners wave again <eos> CORIOLANUS : Saw you Aufidius <eos> LARTIUS : On safe-guard he came to me and did curse Against the Volsces for they had so vilely Yielded the town : he is retired to Antium <eos> CORIOLANUS : Spoke he of me <eos> LARTIUS : He did my lord <eos> CORIOLANUS : How <eos> what <eos> LARTIUS : How often he had met you sword to sword That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes To hopeless restitution so he might Be call'd your vanquisher <eos> CORIOLANUS : At Antium lives he <eos> LARTIUS : At Antium <eos> CORIOLANUS : I wish I had a cause to seek him there To oppose his hatred fully <eos> Welcome home <eos> Behold these are the tribunes of the people The tongues o' the common mouth : I do despise them For they do prank them in authority Against all noble sufferance <eos> SICINIUS : Pass no further <eos> CORIOLANUS : Ha <eos> what is that <eos> BRUTUS : It will be dangerous to go on : no further <eos> CORIOLANUS : What makes this change <eos> MENENIUS : The matter <eos> COMINIUS : Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common <eos> BRUTUS : Cominius no <eos> CORIOLANUS : Have I had children's voices <eos> First Senator : Tribunes give way he shall to the market-place <eos> BRUTUS : The people are incensed against him <eos> SICINIUS : Stop Or all will fall in broil <eos> CORIOLANUS : Are these your herd <eos> Must these have voices that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues <eos> What are your offices <eos> You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth <eos> Have you not set them on <eos> MENENIUS : Be calm be calm <eos> CORIOLANUS : It is a purposed thing and grows by plot To curb the will of the nobility : Suffer't and live with such as cannot rule Nor ever will be ruled <eos> BRUTUS : Call't not a plot : The people cry you mock'd them and of late When corn was given them gratis you repined Scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them Time-pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness <eos> CORIOLANUS : Why this was known before <eos> BRUTUS : Not to them all <eos> CORIOLANUS : Have you inform'd them sithence <eos> BRUTUS : How <eos> I inform them <eos> CORIOLANUS : You are like to do such business <eos> BRUTUS : Not unlike Each way to better yours <eos> CORIOLANUS : Why then should I be consul <eos> By yond clouds Let me deserve so ill as you and make me Your fellow tribune <eos> SICINIUS : You show too much of that For which the people stir : if you will pass To where you are bound you must inquire your way Which you are out of with a gentler spirit Or never be so noble as a consul Nor yoke with him for tribune <eos> MENENIUS : Let's be calm <eos> COMINIUS : The people are abused set on <eos> This paltering Becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus Deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely I' the plain way of his merit <eos> CORIOLANUS : Tell me of corn <eos> This was my speech and I will speak't again <eos> MENENIUS : Not now not now <eos> First Senator : Not in this heat sir now <eos> CORIOLANUS : Now as I live I will <eos> My nobler friends I crave their pardons : For the mutable rank-scented many let them Regard me as I do not flatter and Therein behold themselves : I say again In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition Which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd By mingling them with us the honour'd number Who lack not virtue no nor power but that Which they have given to beggars <eos> MENENIUS : Well no more <eos> First Senator : No more words we beseech you <eos> CORIOLANUS : How <eos> no more <eos> As for my country I have shed my blood Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs Coin words till their decay against those measles Which we disdain should tatter us yet sought The very way to catch them <eos> BRUTUS : You speak o' the people As if you were a god to punish not A man of their infirmity <eos> SICINIUS : 'Twere well We let the people know't <eos> MENENIUS : What what <eos> his choler <eos> CORIOLANUS : Choler <eos> Were I as patient as the midnight sleep By Jove 'twould be my mind <eos> SICINIUS : It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is Not poison any further <eos> CORIOLANUS : Shall remain <eos> Hear you this Triton of the minnows <eos> mark you His absolute 'shall' <eos> COMINIUS : 'Twas from the canon <eos> CORIOLANUS : 'Shall' <eos> O good but most unwise patricians <eos> why You grave but reckless senators have you thus Given Hydra here to choose an officer That with his peremptory 'shall' being but The horn and noise o' the monster's wants not spirit To say he'll turn your current in a ditch And make your channel his <eos> If he have power Then vail your ignorance if none awake Your dangerous lenity <eos> If you are learn'd Be not as common fools if you are not Let them have cushions by you <eos> You are plebeians If they be senators : and they are no less When both your voices blended the great'st taste Most palates theirs <eos> They choose their magistrate And such a one as he who puts his 'shall' His popular 'shall' against a graver bench Than ever frown in Greece <eos> By Jove himself <eos> It makes the consuls base : and my soul aches To know when two authorities are up Neither supreme how soon confusion May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take The one by the other <eos> COMINIUS : Well on to the market-place <eos> CORIOLANUS : Whoever gave that counsel to give forth The corn o' the storehouse gratis as 'twas used Sometime in Greece <eos> MENENIUS : Well well no more of that <eos> CORIOLANUS : Though there the people had more absolute power I say they nourish'd disobedience fed The ruin of the state <eos> BRUTUS : Why shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice <eos> CORIOLANUS : I'll give my reasons More worthier than their voices <eos> They know the corn Was not our recompense resting well assured That ne'er did service for't : being press'd to the war Even when the navel of the state was touch'd They would not thread the gates <eos> This kind of service Did not deserve corn gratis <eos> Being i' the war Their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd Most valour spoke not for them : the accusation Which they have often made against the senate All cause unborn could never be the motive Of our so frank donation <eos> Well what then <eos> How shall this bisson multitude digest The senate's courtesy <eos> Let deeds express What's like to be their words : 'we did request it We are the greater poll and in true fear They gave us our demands <eos>' Thus we debase The nature of our seats and make the rabble Call our cares fears which will in time Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in The crows to peck the eagles <eos> MENENIUS : Come enough <eos> BRUTUS : Enough with over-measure <eos> CORIOLANUS : No take more : What may be sworn by both divine and human Seal what I end withal <eos> This double worship Where one part does disdain with cause the other Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom Cannot conclude but by the yea and no Of general ignorance <eos>it must omit Real necessities and give way the while To unstable slightness : purpose so barr'd it follows Nothing is done to purpose <eos> Therefore beseech you <eos> You that will be less fearful than discreet That love the fundamental part of state More than you doubt the change on't that prefer A noble life before a long and wish To jump a body with a dangerous physic That's sure of death without it at once pluck out The multitudinous tongue let them not lick The sweet which is their poison : your dishonour Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should become't Not having the power to do the good it would For the in which doth control't <eos> BRUTUS : Has said enough <eos> SICINIUS : Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer As traitors do <eos> CORIOLANUS : Thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee <eos> What should the people do with these bald tribunes <eos> On whom depending their obedience fails To the greater bench : in a rebellion When what's not meet but what must be was law Then were they chosen : in a better hour Let what is meet be said it must be meet And throw their power i' the dust <eos> BRUTUS : Manifest treason <eos> SICINIUS : This a consul <eos> no <eos> BRUTUS : The aediles ho <eos> Let him be apprehended <eos> SICINIUS : Go call the people : in whose name myself Attach thee as a traitorous innovator A foe to the public weal : obey I charge thee And follow to thine answer <eos> CORIOLANUS : Hence old goat <eos> Senators &C : We'll surety him <eos> COMINIUS : Aged sir hands off <eos> CORIOLANUS : Hence rotten thing <eos> or I shall shake thy bones Out of thy garments <eos> SICINIUS : Help ye citizens <eos> MENENIUS : On both sides more respect <eos> SICINIUS : Here's he that would take from you all your power <eos> BRUTUS : Seize him AEdiles <eos> Citizens : Down with him <eos> down with him <eos> Senators &C : Weapons weapons weapons <eos> 'Tribunes <eos>' 'Patricians <eos>' 'Citizens <eos>' 'What ho <eos>' 'Sicinius <eos>' 'Brutus <eos>' 'Coriolanus <eos>' 'Citizens <eos>' 'Peace peace peace <eos>' 'Stay hold peace <eos>' MENENIUS : What is about to be <eos> I am out of breath Confusion's near I cannot speak <eos> You tribunes To the people <eos> Coriolanus patience <eos> Speak good Sicinius <eos> SICINIUS : Hear me people peace <eos> Citizens : Let's hear our tribune : peace Speak speak speak <eos> SICINIUS : You are at point to lose your liberties : Marcius would have all from you Marcius Whom late you have named for consul <eos> MENENIUS : Fie fie fie <eos> This is the way to kindle not to quench <eos> First Senator : To unbuild the city and to lay all flat <eos> SICINIUS : What is the city but the people <eos> Citizens : True The people are the city <eos> BRUTUS : By the consent of all we were establish'd The people's magistrates <eos> Citizens : You so remain <eos> MENENIUS : And so are like to do <eos> COMINIUS : That is the way to lay the city flat To bring the roof to the foundation And bury all which yet distinctly ranges In heaps and piles of ruin <eos> SICINIUS : This deserves death <eos> BRUTUS : Or let us stand to our authority Or let us lose it <eos> We do here pronounce Upon the part o' the people in whose power We were elected theirs Marcius is worthy Of present death <eos> SICINIUS : Therefore lay hold of him Bear him to the rock Tarpeian and from thence Into destruction cast him <eos> BRUTUS : AEdiles seize him <eos> Citizens : Yield Marcius yield <eos> MENENIUS : Hear me one word Beseech you tribunes hear me but a word <eos> AEdile : Peace peace <eos> MENENIUS : BRUTUS : Sir those cold ways That seem like prudent helps are very poisonous Where the disease is violent <eos> Lay hands upon him And bear him to the rock <eos> CORIOLANUS : No I'll die here <eos> There's some among you have beheld me fighting : Come try upon yourselves what you have seen me <eos> MENENIUS : Down with that sword <eos> Tribunes withdraw awhile <eos> BRUTUS : Lay hands upon him <eos> COMINIUS : Help Marcius help You that be noble help him young and old <eos> Citizens : Down with him down with him <eos> MENENIUS : Go get you to your house be gone away <eos> All will be naught else <eos> Second Senator : Get you gone <eos> COMINIUS : Stand fast We have as many friends as enemies <eos> MENENIUS : Sham it be put to that <eos> First Senator : The gods forbid <eos> I prithee noble friend home to thy house Leave us to cure this cause <eos> MENENIUS : For 'tis a sore upon us You cannot tent yourself : be gone beseech you <eos> COMINIUS : Come sir along with us <eos> CORIOLANUS : I would they were barbarians <eos>as they are Though in Rome litter'd <eos>not Romans <eos>as they are not Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol <eos> MENENIUS : Be gone Put not your worthy rage into your tongue One time will owe another <eos> CORIOLANUS : On fair ground I could beat forty of them <eos> COMINIUS : I could myself Take up a brace o' the best of them yea the two tribunes : But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands Against a falling fabric <eos> Will you hence Before the tag return <eos> whose rage doth rend Like interrupted waters and o'erbear What they are used to bear <eos> MENENIUS : Pray you be gone : I'll try whether my old wit be in request With those that have but little : this must be patch'd With cloth of any colour <eos> COMINIUS : Nay come away <eos> A Patrician : This man has marr'd his fortune <eos> MENENIUS : His nature is too noble for the world : He would not flatter Neptune for his trident Or Jove for's power to thunder <eos> His heart's his mouth : What his breast forges that his tongue must vent And being angry does forget that ever He heard the name of death <eos> Here's goodly work <eos> Second Patrician : I would they were abed <eos> MENENIUS : I would they were in Tiber <eos> What the vengeance <eos> Could he not speak 'em fair <eos> SICINIUS : Where is this viper That would depopulate the city and Be every man himself <eos> MENENIUS : You worthy tribunes <eos> SICINIUS : He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock With rigorous hands : he hath resisted law And therefore law shall scorn him further trial Than the severity of the public power Which he so sets at nought <eos> First Citizen : He shall well know The noble tribunes are the people's mouths And we their hands <eos> Citizens : He shall sure on't <eos> MENENIUS : Sir sir <eos> SICINIUS : Peace <eos> MENENIUS : Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt With modest warrant <eos> SICINIUS : Sir how comes't that you Have holp to make this rescue <eos> MENENIUS : Hear me speak : As I do know the consul's worthiness So can I name his faults <eos> SICINIUS : Consul <eos> what consul <eos> MENENIUS : The consul Coriolanus <eos> BRUTUS : He consul <eos> Citizens : No no no no no <eos> MENENIUS : If by the tribunes' leave and yours good people I may be heard I would crave a word or two The which shall turn you to no further harm Than so much loss of time <eos> SICINIUS : Speak briefly then For we are peremptory to dispatch This viperous traitor : to eject him hence Were but one danger and to keep him here Our certain death : therefore it is decreed He dies to-night <eos> MENENIUS : Now the good gods forbid That our renowned Rome whose gratitude Towards her deserved children is enroll'd In Jove's own book like an unnatural dam Should now eat up her own <eos> SICINIUS : He's a disease that must be cut away <eos> MENENIUS : O he's a limb that has but a disease Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy <eos> What has he done to Rome that's worthy death <eos> Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost <eos> Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath By many an ounce <eos>he dropp'd it for his country And what is left to lose it by his country Were to us all that do't and suffer it A brand to the end o' the world <eos> SICINIUS : This is clean kam <eos> BRUTUS : Merely awry : when he did love his country It honour'd him <eos> MENENIUS : The service of the foot Being once gangrened is not then respected For what before it was <eos> BRUTUS : We'll hear no more <eos> Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence : Lest his infection being of catching nature Spread further <eos> MENENIUS : One word more one word <eos> This tiger-footed rage when it shall find The harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late Tie leaden pounds to's heels <eos> Proceed by process Lest parties as he is beloved break out And sack great Rome with Romans <eos> BRUTUS : If it were so <eos> SICINIUS : What do ye talk <eos> Have we not had a taste of his obedience <eos> Our aediles smote <eos> ourselves resisted <eos> Come <eos> MENENIUS : Consider this : he has been bred i' the wars Since he could draw a sword and is ill school'd In bolted language meal and bran together He throws without distinction <eos> Give me leave I'll go to him and undertake to bring him Where he shall answer by a lawful form In peace to his utmost peril <eos> First Senator : Noble tribunes It is the humane way : the other course Will prove too bloody and the end of it Unknown to the beginning <eos> SICINIUS : Noble Menenius Be you then as the people's officer <eos> Masters lay down your weapons <eos> BRUTUS : Go not home <eos> SICINIUS : Meet on the market-place <eos> We'll attend you there : Where if you bring not Marcius we'll proceed In our first way <eos> MENENIUS : I'll bring him to you <eos> Let me desire your company : he must come Or what is worst will follow <eos> First Senator : Pray you let's to him <eos> CORIOLANUS : Let them puff all about mine ears present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock That the precipitation might down stretch Below the beam of sight yet will I still Be thus to them <eos> A Patrician : You do the nobler <eos> CORIOLANUS : I muse my mother Does not approve me further who was wont To call them woollen vassals things created To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads In congregations to yawn be still and wonder When one but of my ordinance stood up To speak of peace or war <eos> I talk of you : Why did you wish me milder <eos> would you have me False to my nature <eos> Rather say I play The man I am <eos> VOLUMNIA : O sir sir sir I would have had you put your power well on Before you had worn it out <eos> CORIOLANUS : Let go <eos> VOLUMNIA : You might have been enough the man you are With striving less to be so lesser had been The thwartings of your dispositions if You had not show'd them how ye were disposed Ere they lack'd power to cross you <eos> CORIOLANUS : Let them hang <eos> A Patrician : Ay and burn too <eos> MENENIUS : Come come you have been too rough something too rough You must return and mend it <eos> First Senator : There's no remedy Unless by not so doing our good city Cleave in the midst and perish <eos> VOLUMNIA : Pray be counsell'd : I have a heart as little apt as yours But yet a brain that leads my use of anger To better vantage <eos> MENENIUS : Well said noble woman <eos> Before he should thus stoop to the herd but that The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic For the whole state I would put mine armour on Which I can scarcely bear <eos> CORIOLANUS : What must I do <eos> MENENIUS : Return to the tribunes <eos> CORIOLANUS : Well what then <eos> what then <eos> MENENIUS : Repent what you have spoke <eos> CORIOLANUS : For them <eos> I cannot do it to the gods Must I then do't to them <eos> VOLUMNIA : You are too absolute Though therein you can never be too noble But when extremities speak <eos> I have heard you say Honour and policy like unsever'd friends I' the war do grow together : grant that and tell me In peace what each of them by the other lose That they combine not there <eos> CORIOLANUS : Tush tush <eos> MENENIUS : A good demand <eos> VOLUMNIA : If it be honour in your wars to seem The same you are not which for your best ends You adopt your policy how is it less or worse That it shall hold companionship in peace With honour as in war since that to both It stands in like request <eos> CORIOLANUS : Why force you this <eos> VOLUMNIA : Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people not by your own instruction Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you But with such words that are but rooted in Your tongue though but bastards and syllables Of no allowance to your bosom's truth <eos> Now this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood <eos> I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake required I should do so in honour : I am in this Your wife your son these senators the nobles And you will rather show our general louts How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard Of what that want might ruin <eos> MENENIUS : Noble lady <eos> Come go with us speak fair : you may salve so Not what is dangerous present but the loss Of what is past <eos> VOLUMNIA : I prithee now my son Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand And thus far having stretch'd it <eos>here be with them <eos> Thy knee bussing the stones <eos>for in such business Action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant More learned than the ears <eos>waving thy head Which often thus correcting thy stout heart Now humble as the ripest mulberry That will not hold the handling : or say to them Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess Were fit for thee to use as they to claim In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far As thou hast power and person <eos> MENENIUS : This but done Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours For they have pardons being ask'd as free As words to little purpose <eos> VOLUMNIA : Prithee now Go and be ruled : although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower <eos> Here is Cominius <eos> COMINIUS : I have been i' the market-place and sir'tis fit You make strong party or defend yourself By calmness or by absence : all's in anger <eos> MENENIUS : Only fair speech <eos> COMINIUS : I think 'twill serve if he Can thereto frame his spirit <eos> VOLUMNIA : He must and will Prithee now say you will and go about it <eos> CORIOLANUS : Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce <eos> Must I with base tongue give my noble heart A lie that it must bear <eos> Well I will do't : Yet were there but this single plot to lose This mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it And throw't against the wind <eos> To the market-place <eos> You have put me now to such a part which never I shall discharge to the life <eos> COMINIUS : Come come we'll prompt you <eos> VOLUMNIA : I prithee now sweet son as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier so To have my praise for this perform a part Thou hast not done before <eos> CORIOLANUS : Well I must do't : Away my disposition and possess me Some harlot's spirit <eos> my throat of war be turn'd Which quired with my drum into a pipe Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice That babies lulls asleep <eos> the smiles of knaves Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up The glasses of my sight <eos> a beggar's tongue Make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees Who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his That hath received an alms <eos> I will not do't Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth And by my body's action teach my mind A most inherent baseness <eos> VOLUMNIA : At thy choice then : To beg of thee it is my more dishonour Than thou of them <eos> Come all to ruin let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death With as big heart as thou <eos> Do as thou list Thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me But owe thy pride thyself <eos> CORIOLANUS : Pray be content : Mother I am going to the market-place Chide me no more <eos> I'll mountebank their loves Cog their hearts from them and come home beloved Of all the trades in Rome <eos> Look I am going : Commend me to my wife <eos> I'll return consul Or never trust to what my tongue can do I' the way of flattery further <eos> VOLUMNIA : Do your will <eos> COMINIUS : Away <eos> the tribunes do attend you : arm yourself To answer mildly for they are prepared With accusations as I hear more strong Than are upon you yet <eos> CORIOLANUS : The word is 'mildly <eos>' Pray you let us go : Let them accuse me by invention I Will answer in mine honour <eos> MENENIUS : Ay but mildly <eos> CORIOLANUS : Well mildly be it then <eos> Mildly <eos> BRUTUS : In this point charge him home that he affects Tyrannical power : if he evade us there Enforce him with his envy to the people And that the spoil got on the Antiates Was ne'er distributed <eos> What will he come <eos> AEdile : He's coming <eos> BRUTUS : How accompanied <eos> AEdile : With old Menenius and those senators That always favour'd him <eos> SICINIUS : Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured Set down by the poll <eos> AEdile : I have 'tis ready <eos> SICINIUS : Have you collected them by tribes <eos> AEdile : I have <eos> SICINIUS : Assemble presently the people hither And when they bear me say 'It shall be so I' the right and strength o' the commons' be it either For death for fine or banishment then let them If I say fine cry 'Fine' if death cry 'Death <eos>' Insisting on the old prerogative And power i' the truth o' the cause <eos> AEdile : I shall inform them <eos> BRUTUS : And when such time they have begun to cry Let them not cease but with a din confused Enforce the present execution Of what we chance to sentence <eos> AEdile : Very well <eos> SICINIUS : Make them be strong and ready for this hint When we shall hap to give 't them <eos> BRUTUS : Go about it <eos> Put him to choler straight : he hath been used Ever to conquer and to have his worth Of contradiction : being once chafed he cannot Be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks What's in his heart and that is there which looks With us to break his neck <eos> SICINIUS : Well here he comes <eos> MENENIUS : Calmly I do beseech you <eos> CORIOLANUS : Ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece Will bear the knave by the volume <eos> The honour'd gods Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice Supplied with worthy men <eos> plant love among 's <eos> Throng our large temples with the shows of peace And not our streets with war <eos> First Senator : Amen amen <eos> MENENIUS : A noble wish <eos> SICINIUS : Draw near ye people <eos> AEdile : List to your tribunes <eos> Audience : peace I say <eos> CORIOLANUS : First hear me speak <eos> Both Tribunes : Well say <eos> Peace ho <eos> CORIOLANUS : Shall I be charged no further than this present <eos> Must all determine here <eos> SICINIUS : I do demand If you submit you to the people's voices Allow their officers and are content To suffer lawful censure for such faults As shall be proved upon you <eos> CORIOLANUS : I am content <eos> MENENIUS : Lo citizens he says he is content : The warlike service he has done consider think Upon the wounds his body bears which show Like graves i' the holy churchyard <eos> CORIOLANUS : Scratches with briers Scars to move laughter only <eos> MENENIUS : Consider further That when he speaks not like a citizen You find him like a soldier : do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds But as I say such as become a soldier Rather than envy you <eos> COMINIUS : Well well no more <eos> CORIOLANUS : What is the matter That being pass'd for consul with full voice I am so dishonour'd that the very hour You take it off again <eos> SICINIUS : Answer to us <eos> CORIOLANUS : Say then : 'tis true I ought so <eos> SICINIUS : We charge you that you have contrived to take From Rome all season'd office and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical For which you are a traitor to the people <eos> CORIOLANUS : How <eos> traitor <eos> MENENIUS : Nay temperately your promise <eos> CORIOLANUS : The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people <eos> Call me their traitor <eos> Thou injurious tribune <eos> Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths In thy hand clutch'd as many millions in Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say 'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free As I do pray the gods <eos> SICINIUS : Mark you this people <eos> Citizens : To the rock to the rock with him <eos> SICINIUS : Peace <eos> We need not put new matter to his charge : What you have seen him do and heard him speak Beating your officers cursing yourselves Opposing laws with strokes and here defying Those whose great power must try him even this So criminal and in such capital kind Deserves the extremest death <eos> BRUTUS : But since he hath Served well for Rome <eos> CORIOLANUS : What do you prate of service <eos> BRUTUS : I talk of that that know it <eos> CORIOLANUS : You <eos> MENENIUS : Is this the promise that you made your mother <eos> COMINIUS : Know I pray you <eos> CORIOLANUS : I know no further : Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death Vagabond exile raying pent to linger But with a grain a day I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word Nor cheque my courage for what they can give To have't with saying 'Good morrow <eos>' SICINIUS : For that he has As much as in him lies from time to time Envied against the people seeking means To pluck away their power as now at last Given hostile strokes and that not in the presence Of dreaded justice but on the ministers That do distribute it in the name o' the people And in the power of us the tribunes we Even from this instant banish him our city In peril of precipitation From off the rock Tarpeian never more To enter our Rome gates : i' the people's name I say it shall be so <eos> Citizens : It shall be so it shall be so let him away : He's banish'd and it shall be so <eos> COMINIUS : Hear me my masters and my common friends <eos> SICINIUS : He's sentenced no more hearing <eos> COMINIUS : Let me speak : I have been consul and can show for Rome Her enemies' marks upon me <eos> I do love My country's good with a respect more tender More holy and profound than mine own life My dear wife's estimate her womb's increase And treasure of my loins then if I would Speak that <eos> SICINIUS : We know your drift : speak what <eos> BRUTUS : There's no more to be said but he is banish'd As enemy to the people and his country : It shall be so <eos> Citizens : It shall be so it shall be so <eos> CORIOLANUS : You common cry of curs <eos> whose breath I hate As reek o' the rotten fens whose loves I prize As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air I banish you And here remain with your uncertainty <eos> Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts <eos> Your enemies with nodding of their plumes Fan you into despair <eos> Have the power still To banish your defenders till at length Your ignorance which finds not till it feels Making not reservation of yourselves Still your own foes deliver you as most Abated captives to some nation That won you without blows <eos> Despising For you the city thus I turn my back : There is a world elsewhere <eos> AEdile : The people's enemy is gone is gone <eos> Citizens : Our enemy is banish'd <eos> he is gone <eos> Hoo <eos> hoo <eos> SICINIUS : Go see him out at gates and follow him As he hath followed you with all despite Give him deserved vexation <eos> Let a guard Attend us through the city <eos> Citizens : Come come let's see him out at gates come <eos> The gods preserve our noble tribunes <eos> Come <eos> CORIOLANUS : Come leave your tears : a brief farewell : the beast With many heads butts me away <eos> Nay mother Where is your ancient courage <eos> you were used To say extremity was the trier of spirits That common chances common men could bear That when the sea was calm all boats alike Show'd mastership in floating fortune's blows When most struck home being gentle wounded craves A noble cunning : you were used to load me With precepts that would make invincible The heart that conn'd them <eos> VIRGILIA : O heavens <eos> O heavens <eos> CORIOLANUS : Nay <eos> prithee woman <eos> VOLUMNIA : Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome And occupations perish <eos> CORIOLANUS : What what what <eos> I shall be loved when I am lack'd <eos> Nay mother <eos> Resume that spirit when you were wont to say If you had been the wife of Hercules Six of his labours you'ld have done and saved Your husband so much sweat <eos> Cominius Droop not adieu <eos> Farewell my wife my mother : I'll do well yet <eos> Thou old and true Menenius Thy tears are salter than a younger man's And venomous to thine eyes <eos> My sometime general I have seen thee stem and thou hast oft beheld Heart-hardening spectacles tell these sad women 'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes As 'tis to laugh at 'em <eos> My mother you wot well My hazards still have been your solace : and Believe't not lightly <eos>though I go alone Like to a lonely dragon that his fen Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen <eos>your son Will or exceed the common or be caught With cautelous baits and practise <eos> VOLUMNIA : My first son <eos> Whither wilt thou go <eos> Take good Cominius With thee awhile : determine on some course More than a wild exposture to each chance That starts i' the way before thee <eos> CORIOLANUS : O the gods <eos> COMINIUS : I'll follow thee a month devise with thee Where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us And we of thee : so if the time thrust forth A cause for thy repeal we shall not send O'er the vast world to seek a single man And lose advantage which doth ever cool I' the absence of the needer <eos> CORIOLANUS : Fare ye well : Thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one That's yet unbruised : bring me but out at gate <eos> Come my sweet wife my dearest mother and My friends of noble touch when I am forth Bid me farewell and smile <eos> I pray you come <eos> While I remain above the ground you shall Hear from me still and never of me aught But what is like me formerly <eos> MENENIUS : That's worthily As any ear can hear <eos> Come let's not weep <eos> If I could shake off but one seven years From these old arms and legs by the good gods I'ld with thee every foot <eos> CORIOLANUS : Give me thy hand : Come <eos> SICINIUS : Bid them all home he's gone and we'll no further <eos> The nobility are vex'd whom we see have sided In his behalf <eos> BRUTUS : Now we have shown our power Let us seem humbler after it is done Than when it was a-doing <eos> SICINIUS : Bid them home : Say their great enemy is gone and they Stand in their ancient strength <eos> BRUTUS : Dismiss them home <eos> Here comes his mother <eos> SICINIUS : Let's not meet her <eos> BRUTUS : Why <eos> SICINIUS : They say she's mad <eos> BRUTUS : They have ta'en note of us : keep on your way <eos> VOLUMNIA : O ye're well met : the hoarded plague o' the gods Requite your love <eos> MENENIUS : Peace peace be not so loud <eos> VOLUMNIA : If that I could for weeping you should hear <eos> Nay and you shall hear some <eos> Will you be gone <eos> VIRGILIA : SICINIUS : Are you mankind <eos> VOLUMNIA : Ay fool is that a shame <eos> Note but this fool <eos> Was not a man my father <eos> Hadst thou foxship To banish him that struck more blows for Rome Than thou hast spoken words <eos> SICINIUS : O blessed heavens <eos> VOLUMNIA : More noble blows than ever thou wise words And for Rome's good <eos> I'll tell thee what yet go : Nay but thou shalt stay too : I would my son Were in Arabia and thy tribe before him His good sword in his hand <eos> SICINIUS : What then <eos> VIRGILIA : What then <eos> He'ld make an end of thy posterity <eos> VOLUMNIA : Bastards and all <eos> Good man the wounds that he does bear for Rome <eos> MENENIUS : Come come peace <eos> SICINIUS : I would he had continued to his country As he began and not unknit himself The noble knot he made <eos> BRUTUS : I would he had <eos> VOLUMNIA : 'I would he had' <eos> 'Twas you incensed the rabble : Cats that can judge as fitly of his worth As I can of those mysteries which heaven Will not have earth to know <eos> BRUTUS : Pray let us go <eos> VOLUMNIA : Now pray sir get you gone : You have done a brave deed <eos> Ere you go hear this : <eos> As far as doth the Capitol exceed The meanest house in Rome so far my son <eos> This lady's husband here this do you see <eos> Whom you have banish'd does exceed you all <eos> BRUTUS : Well well we'll leave you <eos> SICINIUS : Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits <eos> VOLUMNIA : Take my prayers with you <eos> I would the gods had nothing else to do But to confirm my curses <eos> Could I meet 'em But once a-day it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to't <eos> MENENIUS : You have told them home And by my troth you have cause <eos> You'll sup with me <eos> VOLUMNIA : Anger's my meat I sup upon myself And so shall starve with feeding <eos> Come let's go : Leave this faint puling and lament as I do In anger Juno-like <eos> Come come come <eos> MENENIUS : Fie fie fie <eos> Roman : I know you well sir and you know me : your name I think is Adrian <eos> Volsce : It is so sir : truly I have forgot you <eos> Roman : I am a Roman and my services are as you are against 'em : know you me yet <eos> Volsce : Nicanor <eos> no <eos> Roman : The same sir <eos> Volsce : You had more beard when I last saw you but your favour is well approved by your tongue <eos> What's the news in Rome <eos> I have a note from the Volscian state to find you out there : you have well saved me a day's journey <eos> Roman : There hath been in Rome strange insurrections the people against the senators patricians and nobles <eos> Volsce : Hath been <eos> is it ended then <eos> Our state thinks not so : they are in a most warlike preparation and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division <eos> Roman : The main blaze of it is past but a small thing would make it flame again : for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever <eos> This lies glowing I can tell you and is almost mature for the violent breaking out <eos> Volsce : Coriolanus banished <eos> Roman : Banished sir <eos> Volsce : You will be welcome with this intelligence Nicanor <eos> Roman : The day serves well for them now <eos> I have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fallen out with her husband <eos> Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars his great opposer Coriolanus being now in no request of his country <eos> Volsce : He cannot choose <eos> I am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you : you have ended my business and I will merrily accompany you home <eos> Roman : I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from Rome all tending to the good of their adversaries <eos> Have you an army ready say you <eos> Volsce : A most royal one the centurions and their charges distinctly billeted already in the entertainment and to be on foot at an hour's warning <eos> Roman : I am joyful to hear of their readiness and am the man I think that shall set them in present action <eos> So sir heartily well met and most glad of your company <eos> Volsce : You take my part from me sir I have the most cause to be glad of yours <eos> Roman : Well let us go together <eos> CORIOLANUS : A goodly city is this Antium <eos> City 'Tis I that made thy widows : many an heir Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars Have I heard groan and drop : then know me not Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones In puny battle slay me <eos> Save you sir <eos> Citizen : And you <eos> CORIOLANUS : Direct me if it be your will Where great Aufidius lies : is he in Antium <eos> Citizen : He is and feasts the nobles of the state At his house this night <eos> CORIOLANUS : Which is his house beseech you <eos> Citizen : This here before you <eos> CORIOLANUS : Thank you sir : farewell <eos> O world thy slippery turns <eos> Friends now fast sworn Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart Whose house whose bed whose meal and exercise Are still together who twin as 'twere in love Unseparable shall within this hour On a dissension of a doit break out To bitterest enmity : so fellest foes Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep To take the one the other by some chance Some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends And interjoin their issues <eos> So with me : My birth-place hate I and my love's upon This enemy town <eos> I'll enter : if he slay me He does fair justice if he give me way I'll do his country service <eos> First Servingman : Wine wine wine <eos> What service is here <eos> I think our fellows are asleep <eos> Second Servingman : Where's Cotus <eos> my master calls for him <eos> Cotus <eos> CORIOLANUS : A goodly house : the feast smells well but I Appear not like a guest <eos> First Servingman : What would you have friend <eos> whence are you <eos> Here's no place for you : pray go to the door <eos> CORIOLANUS : I have deserved no better entertainment In being Coriolanus <eos> Second Servingman : Whence are you sir <eos> Has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions <eos> Pray get you out <eos> CORIOLANUS : Away <eos> Second Servingman : Away <eos> get you away <eos> CORIOLANUS : Now thou'rt troublesome <eos> Second Servingman : Are you so brave <eos> I'll have you talked with anon <eos> Third Servingman : What fellow's this <eos> First Servingman : A strange one as ever I looked on : I cannot get him out of the house : prithee call my master to him <eos> Third Servingman : What have you to do here fellow <eos> Pray you avoid the house <eos> CORIOLANUS : Let me but stand I will not hurt your hearth <eos> Third Servingman : What are you <eos> CORIOLANUS : A gentleman <eos> Third Servingman : A marvellous poor one <eos> CORIOLANUS : True so I am <eos> Third Servingman : Pray you poor gentleman take up some other station here's no place for you pray you avoid : come <eos> CORIOLANUS : Follow your function go and batten on cold bits <eos> Third Servingman : What you will not <eos> Prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here <eos> Second Servingman : And I shall <eos> Third Servingman : Where dwellest thou <eos> CORIOLANUS : Under the canopy <eos> Third Servingman : Under the canopy <eos> CORIOLANUS : Ay <eos> Third Servingman : Where's that <eos> CORIOLANUS : I' the city of kites and crows <eos> Third Servingman : I' the city of kites and crows <eos> What an ass it is <eos> Then thou dwellest with daws too <eos> CORIOLANUS : No I serve not thy master <eos> Third Servingman : How sir <eos> do you meddle with my master <eos> CORIOLANUS : Ay 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress <eos> Thou pratest and pratest serve with thy trencher hence <eos> AUFIDIUS : Where is this fellow <eos> Second Servingman : Here sir : I'ld have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords within <eos> AUFIDIUS : Whence comest thou <eos> what wouldst thou <eos> thy name <eos> Why speak'st not <eos> speak man : what's thy name <eos> CORIOLANUS : If Tullus Not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not Think me for the man I am necessity Commands me name myself <eos> AUFIDIUS : What is thy name <eos> CORIOLANUS : A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears And harsh in sound to thine <eos> AUFIDIUS : Say what's thy name <eos> Thou hast a grim appearance and thy face Bears a command in't though thy tackle's torn <eos> Thou show'st a noble vessel : what's thy name <eos> CORIOLANUS : Prepare thy brow to frown : know'st thou me yet <eos> AUFIDIUS : I know thee not : thy name <eos> CORIOLANUS : My name is Caius Marcius who hath done To thee particularly and to all the Volsces Great hurt and mischief thereto witness may My surname Coriolanus : the painful service The extreme dangers and the drops of blood Shed for my thankless country are requited But with that surname a good memory And witness of the malice and displeasure Which thou shouldst bear me : only that name remains The cruelty and envy of the people Permitted by our dastard nobles who Have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be Whoop'd out of Rome <eos> Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope <eos> Mistake me not <eos>to save my life for if I had fear'd death of all the men i' the world I would have 'voided thee but in mere spite To be full quit of those my banishers Stand I before thee here <eos> Then if thou hast A heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims Of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight And make my misery serve thy turn : so use it That my revengeful services may prove As benefits to thee for I will fight Against my canker'd country with the spleen Of all the under fiends <eos> But if so be Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes Thou'rt tired then in a word I also am Longer to live most weary and present My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice Which not to cut would show thee but a fool Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast And cannot live but to thy shame unless It be to do thee service <eos> AUFIDIUS : O Marcius Marcius <eos> Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy <eos> If Jupiter Should from yond cloud speak divine things And say 'Tis true' I'ld not believe them more Than thee all noble Marcius <eos> Let me twine Mine arms about that body where against My grained ash an hundred times hath broke And scarr'd the moon with splinters : here I clip The anvil of my sword and do contest As hotly and as nobly with thy love As ever in ambitious strength I did Contend against thy valour <eos> Know thou first I loved the maid I married never man Sigh'd truer breath but that I see thee here Thou noble thing <eos> more dances my rapt heart Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold <eos> Why thou Mars <eos> I tell thee We have a power on foot and I had purpose Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn Or lose mine arm fort : thou hast beat me out Twelve several times and I have nightly since Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me We have been down together in my sleep Unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat And waked half dead with nothing <eos> Worthy Marcius Had we no quarrel else to Rome but that Thou art thence banish'd we would muster all From twelve to seventy and pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome Like a bold flood o'er-bear <eos> O come go in And take our friendly senators by the hands Who now are here taking their leaves of me Who am prepared against your territories Though not for Rome itself <eos> CORIOLANUS : You bless me gods <eos> AUFIDIUS : Therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges take The one half of my commission and set down <eos> As best thou art experienced since thou know'st Thy country's strength and weakness <eos>thine own ways Whether to knock against the gates of Rome Or rudely visit them in parts remote To fright them ere destroy <eos> But come in : Let me commend thee first to those that shall Say yea to thy desires <eos> A thousand welcomes <eos> And more a friend than e'er an enemy Yet Marcius that was much <eos> Your hand : most welcome <eos> First Servingman : Here's a strange alteration <eos> Second Servingman : By my hand I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him <eos> First Servingman : What an arm he has <eos> he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top <eos> Second Servingman : Nay I knew by his face that there was something in him : he had sir a kind of face methought <eos>I cannot tell how to term it <eos> First Servingman : He had so looking as it were <eos>would I were hanged but I thought there was more in him than I could think <eos> Second Servingman : So did I I'll be sworn : he is simply the rarest man i' the world <eos> First Servingman : I think he is : but a greater soldier than he you wot on <eos> Second Servingman : Who my master <eos> First Servingman : Nay it's no matter for that <eos> Second Servingman : Worth six on him <eos> First Servingman : Nay not so neither : but I take him to be the greater soldier <eos> Second Servingman : Faith look you one cannot tell how to say that : for the defence of a town our general is excellent <eos> First Servingman : Ay and for an assault too <eos> Third Servingman : O slaves I can tell you news <eos> news you rascals <eos> First Servingman : What what what <eos> let's partake <eos> Third Servingman : I would not be a Roman of all nations I had as lieve be a condemned man <eos> First Servingman : Wherefore <eos> wherefore <eos> Third Servingman : Why here's he that was wont to thwack our general Caius Marcius <eos> First Servingman : Why do you say 'thwack our general ' <eos> Third Servingman : I do not say 'thwack our general' but he was always good enough for him <eos> Second Servingman : Come we are fellows and friends : he was ever too hard for him I have heard him say so himself <eos> First Servingman : He was too hard for him directly to say the troth on't : before Corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado <eos> Second Servingman : An he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too <eos> First Servingman : But more of thy news <eos> Third Servingman : Why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars set at upper end o' the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him : our general himself makes a mistress of him : sanctifies himself with's hand and turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse <eos> But the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i' the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table <eos> He'll go he says and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears : he will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled <eos> Second Servingman : And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine <eos> Third Servingman : Do't <eos> he will do't for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he's in directitude <eos> First Servingman : Directitude <eos> what's that <eos> Third Servingman : But when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel all with him <eos> First Servingman : But when goes this forward <eos> Third Servingman : To-morrow to-day presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon : 'tis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips <eos> Second Servingman : Why then we shall have a stirring world again <eos> This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad-makers <eos> First Servingman : Let me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as day does night it's spritely waking audible and full of vent <eos> Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men <eos> Second Servingman : 'Tis so : and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds <eos> First Servingman : Ay and it makes men hate one another <eos> Third Servingman : Reason because they then less need one another <eos> The wars for my money <eos> I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians <eos> They are rising they are rising <eos> All : In in in in <eos> SICINIUS : We hear not of him neither need we fear him His remedies are tame i' the present peace And quietness of the people which before Were in wild hurry <eos> Here do we make his friends Blush that the world goes well who rather had Though they themselves did suffer by't behold Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see Our tradesmen with in their shops and going About their functions friendly <eos> BRUTUS : We stood to't in good time <eos> Is this Menenius <eos> SICINIUS : 'Tis he'tis he : O he is grown most kind of late <eos> Both Tribunes : Hail sir <eos> MENENIUS : Hail to you both <eos> SICINIUS : Your Coriolanus Is not much miss'd but with his friends : The commonwealth doth stand and so would do Were he more angry at it <eos> MENENIUS : All's well and might have been much better if He could have temporized <eos> SICINIUS : Where is he hear you <eos> MENENIUS : Nay I hear nothing : his mother and his wife Hear nothing from him <eos> Citizens : The gods preserve you both <eos> SICINIUS : God-den our neighbours <eos> BRUTUS : God-den to you all god-den to you all <eos> First Citizen : Ourselves our wives and children on our knees Are bound to pray for you both <eos> SICINIUS : Live and thrive <eos> BRUTUS : Farewell kind neighbours : we wish'd Coriolanus Had loved you as we did <eos> Citizens : Now the gods keep you <eos> Both Tribunes : Farewell farewell <eos> SICINIUS : This is a happier and more comely time Than when these fellows ran about the streets Crying confusion <eos> BRUTUS : Caius Marcius was A worthy officer i' the war but insolent O'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking Self-loving <eos> SICINIUS : And affecting one sole throne Without assistance <eos> MENENIUS : I think not so <eos> SICINIUS : We should by this to all our lamentation If he had gone forth consul found it so <eos> BRUTUS : The gods have well prevented it and Rome Sits safe and still without him <eos> AEdile : Worthy tribunes There is a slave whom we have put in prison Reports the Volsces with two several powers Are enter'd in the Roman territories And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em <eos> MENENIUS : 'Tis Aufidius Who hearing of our Marcius' banishment Thrusts forth his horns again into the world Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome And durst not once peep out <eos> SICINIUS : Come what talk you Of Marcius <eos> BRUTUS : Go see this rumourer whipp'd <eos> It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us <eos> MENENIUS : Cannot be <eos> We have record that very well it can And three examples of the like have been Within my age <eos> But reason with the fellow Before you punish him where he heard this Lest you shall chance to whip your information And beat the messenger who bids beware Of what is to be dreaded <eos> SICINIUS : Tell not me : I know this cannot be <eos> BRUTUS : Not possible <eos> Messenger : The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the senate-house : some news is come That turns their countenances <eos> SICINIUS : 'Tis this slave <eos> Go whip him 'fore the people's eyes : <eos>his raising Nothing but his report <eos> Messenger : Yes worthy sir The slave's report is seconded and more More fearful is deliver'd <eos> SICINIUS : What more fearful <eos> Messenger : It is spoke freely out of many mouths <eos> How probable I do not know <eos>that Marcius Join'd with Aufidius leads a power 'gainst Rome And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thing <eos> SICINIUS : This is most likely <eos> BRUTUS : Raised only that the weaker sort may wish Good Marcius home again <eos> SICINIUS : The very trick on't <eos> MENENIUS : This is unlikely : He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violentest contrariety <eos> Second Messenger : You are sent for to the senate : A fearful army led by Caius Marcius Associated with Aufidius rages Upon our territories and have already O'erborne their way consumed with fire and took What lay before them <eos> COMINIUS : O you have made good work <eos> MENENIUS : What news <eos> what news <eos> COMINIUS : You have holp to ravish your own daughters and To melt the city leads upon your pates To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses <eos> MENENIUS : What's the news <eos> what's the news <eos> COMINIUS : Your temples burned in their cement and Your franchises whereon you stood confined Into an auger's bore <eos> MENENIUS : Pray now your news <eos> You have made fair work I fear me <eos> <eos>Pray your news <eos> <eos> If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians <eos> COMINIUS : If <eos> He is their god : he leads them like a thing Made by some other deity than nature That shapes man better and they follow him Against us brats with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies Or butchers killing flies <eos> MENENIUS : You have made good work You and your apron-men you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic-eaters <eos> COMINIUS : He will shake Your Rome about your ears <eos> MENENIUS : As Hercules Did shake down mellow fruit <eos> You have made fair work <eos> BRUTUS : But is this true sir <eos> COMINIUS : Ay and you'll look pale Before you find it other <eos> All the regions Do smilingly revolt and who resist Are mock'd for valiant ignorance And perish constant fools <eos> Who is't can blame him <eos> Your enemies and his find something in him <eos> MENENIUS : We are all undone unless The noble man have mercy <eos> COMINIUS : Who shall ask it <eos> The tribunes cannot do't for shame the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds : for his best friends if they Should say 'Be good to Rome' they charged him even As those should do that had deserved his hate And therein show'd like enemies <eos> MENENIUS : 'Tis true : If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it I have not the face To say 'Beseech you cease <eos>' You have made fair hands You and your crafts <eos> you have crafted fair <eos> COMINIUS : You have brought A trembling upon Rome such as was never So incapable of help <eos> Both Tribunes : Say not we brought it <eos> MENENIUS : How <eos> Was it we <eos> we loved him but like beasts And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters Who did hoot him out o' the city <eos> COMINIUS : But I fear They'll roar him in again <eos> Tullus Aufidius The second name of men obeys his points As if he were his officer : desperation Is all the policy strength and defence That Rome can make against them <eos> MENENIUS : Here come the clusters <eos> And is Aufidius with him <eos> You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus' exile <eos> Now he's coming And not a hair upon a soldier's head Which will not prove a whip : as many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down And pay you for your voices <eos> 'Tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal We have deserved it <eos> Citizens : Faith we hear fearful news <eos> First Citizen : For mine own part When I said banish him I said 'twas pity <eos> Second Citizen : And so did I <eos> Third Citizen : And so did I and to say the truth so did very many of us : that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will <eos> COMINIUS : Ye re goodly things you voices <eos> MENENIUS : You have made Good work you and your cry <eos> Shall's to the Capitol <eos> COMINIUS : O ay what else <eos> SICINIUS : Go masters get you home be not dismay'd : These are a side that would be glad to have This true which they so seem to fear <eos> Go home And show no sign of fear <eos> First Citizen : The gods be good to us <eos> Come masters let's home <eos> I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished him <eos> Second Citizen : So did we all <eos> But come let's home <eos> BRUTUS : I do not like this news <eos> SICINIUS : Nor I <eos> BRUTUS : Let's to the Capitol <eos> Would half my wealth Would buy this for a lie <eos> SICINIUS : Pray let us go <eos> AUFIDIUS : Do they still fly to the Roman <eos> Lieutenant : I do not know what witchcraft's in him but Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat Their talk at table and their thanks at end And you are darken'd in this action sir Even by your own <eos> AUFIDIUS : I cannot help it now Unless by using means I lame the foot Of our design <eos> He bears himself more proudlier Even to my person than I thought he would When first I did embrace him : yet his nature In that's no changeling and I must excuse What cannot be amended <eos> Lieutenant : Yet I wish sir <eos> I mean for your particular <eos>you had not Join'd in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solely <eos> AUFIDIUS : I understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him <eos> Although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly <eos> And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state Fights dragon-like and does achieve as soon As draw his sword yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine Whene'er we come to our account <eos> Lieutenant : Sir I beseech you think you he'll carry Rome <eos> AUFIDIUS : All places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his : The senators and patricians love him too : The tribunes are no soldiers and their people Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty To expel him thence <eos> I think he'll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish who takes it By sovereignty of nature <eos> First he was A noble servant to them but he could not Carry his honours even : whether 'twas pride Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From the casque to the cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controll'd the war but one of these <eos> As he hath spices of them all not all For I dare so far free him <eos>made him fear'd So hated and so banish'd : but he has a merit To choke it in the utterance <eos> So our virtues Lie in the interpretation of the time : And power unto itself most commendable Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair To extol what it hath done <eos> One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail <eos> Come let's away <eos> When Caius Rome is thine Thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine <eos> MENENIUS : No I'll not go : you hear what he hath said Which was sometime his general who loved him In a most dear particular <eos> He call'd me father : But what o' that <eos> Go you that banish'd him A mile before his tent fall down and knee The way into his mercy : nay if he coy'd To hear Cominius speak I'll keep at home <eos> COMINIUS : He would not seem to know me <eos> MENENIUS : Do you hear <eos> COMINIUS : Yet one time he did call me by my name : I urged our old acquaintance and the drops That we have bled together <eos> Coriolanus He would not answer to : forbad all names He was a kind of nothing titleless Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire Of burning Rome <eos> MENENIUS : Why so : you have made good work <eos> A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome To make coals cheap <eos>a noble memory <eos> COMINIUS : I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon When it was less expected : he replied It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punish'd <eos> MENENIUS : Very well : Could he say less <eos> COMINIUS : I offer'd to awaken his regard For's private friends : his answer to me was He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff : he said 'twas folly For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt And still to nose the offence <eos> MENENIUS : For one poor grain or two <eos> I am one of those his mother wife his child And this brave fellow too we are the grains : You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon : we must be burnt for you <eos> SICINIUS : Nay pray be patient : if you refuse your aid In this so never-needed help yet do not Upbraid's with our distress <eos> But sure if you Would be your country's pleader your good tongue More than the instant army we can make Might stop our countryman <eos> MENENIUS : No I'll not meddle <eos> SICINIUS : Pray you go to him <eos> MENENIUS : What should I do <eos> BRUTUS : Only make trial what your love can do For Rome towards Marcius <eos> MENENIUS : Well and say that Marcius Return me as Cominius is return'd Unheard what then <eos> But as a discontented friend grief-shot With his unkindness <eos> say't be so <eos> SICINIUS : Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome after the measure As you intended well <eos> MENENIUS : I'll undertake 't : I think he'll hear me <eos> Yet to bite his lip And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me <eos> He was not taken well he had not dined : The veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then We pout upon the morning are unapt To give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd These and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding we have suppler souls Than in our priest-like fasts : therefore I'll watch him Till he be dieted to my request And then I'll set upon him <eos> BRUTUS : You know the very road into his kindness And cannot lose your way <eos> MENENIUS : Good faith I'll prove him Speed how it will <eos> I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success <eos> COMINIUS : He'll never hear him <eos> SICINIUS : Not <eos> COMINIUS : I tell you he does sit in gold his eye Red as 'twould burn Rome and his injury The gaoler to his pity <eos> I kneel'd before him 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise' dismiss'd me Thus with his speechless hand : what he would do He sent in writing after me what he would not Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions : So that all hope is vain <eos> Unless his noble mother and his wife Who as I hear mean to solicit him For mercy to his country <eos> Therefore let's hence And with our fair entreaties haste them on <eos> First Senator : Stay : whence are you <eos> Second Senator : Stand and go back <eos> MENENIUS : You guard like men 'tis well : but by your leave I am an officer of state and come To speak with Coriolanus <eos> First Senator : From whence <eos> MENENIUS : From Rome <eos> First Senator : You may not pass you must return : our general Will no more hear from thence <eos> Second Senator : You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before You'll speak with Coriolanus <eos> MENENIUS : Good my friends If you have heard your general talk of Rome And of his friends there it is lots to blanks My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius <eos> First Senator : Be it so go back : the virtue of your name Is not here passable <eos> MENENIUS : I tell thee fellow The general is my lover : I have been The book of his good acts whence men have read His name unparallel'd haply amplified For I have ever verified my friends Of whom he's chief with all the size that verity Would without lapsing suffer : nay sometimes Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise Have almost stamp'd the leasing : therefore fellow I must have leave to pass <eos> First Senator : Faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely <eos> Therefore go back <eos> MENENIUS : Prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius always factionary on the party of your general <eos> Second Senator : Howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have I am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass <eos> Therefore go back <eos> MENENIUS : Has he dined canst thou tell <eos> for I would not speak with him till after dinner <eos> First Senator : You are a Roman are you <eos> MENENIUS : I am as thy general is <eos> First Senator : Then you should hate Rome as he does <eos> Can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be <eos> Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this <eos> No you are deceived therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution : you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon <eos> MENENIUS : Sirrah if thy captain knew I were here he would use me with estimation <eos> Second Senator : Come my captain knows you not <eos> MENENIUS : I mean thy general <eos> First Senator : My general cares not for you <eos> Back I say go lest I let forth your half-pint of blood back <eos>that's the utmost of your having : back <eos> MENENIUS : Nay but fellow fellow <eos> CORIOLANUS : What's the matter <eos> MENENIUS : Now you companion I'll say an errand for you : You shall know now that I am in estimation you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus : guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i' the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee <eos> The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does <eos> O my son my son <eos> thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it <eos> I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen <eos> The good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here <eos>this who like a block hath denied my access to thee <eos> CORIOLANUS : Away <eos> MENENIUS : How <eos> away <eos> CORIOLANUS : Wife mother child I know not <eos> My affairs Are servanted to others : though I owe My revenge properly my remission lies In Volscian breasts <eos> That we have been familiar Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather Than pity note how much <eos> Therefore be gone <eos> Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force <eos> Yet for I loved thee Take this along I writ it for thy sake And would have rent it <eos> Another word Menenius I will not hear thee speak <eos> This man Aufidius Was my beloved in Rome : yet thou behold'st <eos> AUFIDIUS : You keep a constant temper <eos> First Senator : Now sir is your name Menenius <eos> Second Senator : 'Tis a spell you see of much power : you know the way home again <eos> First Senator : Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back <eos> Second Senator : What cause do you think I have to swoon <eos> MENENIUS : I neither care for the world nor your general : for such things as you I can scarce think there's any ye're so slight <eos> He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another : let your general do his worst <eos> For you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age <eos> I say to you as I was said to Away <eos> First Senator : A noble fellow I warrant him <eos> Second Senator : The worthy fellow is our general : he's the rock the oak not to be wind-shaken <eos> CORIOLANUS : We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow Set down our host <eos> My partner in this action You must report to the Volscian lords how plainly I have borne this business <eos> AUFIDIUS : Only their ends You have respected stopp'd your ears against The general suit of Rome never admitted A private whisper no not with such friends That thought them sure of you <eos> CORIOLANUS : This last old man Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome Loved me above the measure of a father Nay godded me indeed <eos> Their latest refuge Was to send him for whose old love I have Though I show'd sourly to him once more offer'd The first conditions which they did refuse And cannot now accept to grace him only That thought he could do more a very little I have yielded to : fresh embassies and suits Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter Will I lend ear to <eos> Ha <eos> what shout is this <eos> Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow In the same time 'tis made <eos> I will not <eos> My wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould Wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand The grandchild to her blood <eos> But out affection <eos> All bond and privilege of nature break <eos> Let it be virtuous to be obstinate <eos> What is that curt'sy worth <eos> or those doves' eyes Which can make gods forsworn <eos> I melt and am not Of stronger earth than others <eos> My mother bows As if Olympus to a molehill should In supplication nod : and my young boy Hath an aspect of intercession which Great nature cries 'Deny not <eos>' let the Volsces Plough Rome and harrow Italy : I'll never Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand As if a man were author of himself And knew no other kin <eos> VIRGILIA : My lord and husband <eos> CORIOLANUS : These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome <eos> VIRGILIA : The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so <eos> CORIOLANUS : Like a dull actor now I have forgot my part and I am out Even to a full disgrace <eos> Best of my flesh Forgive my tyranny but do not say For that 'Forgive our Romans <eos>' O a kiss Long as my exile sweet as my revenge <eos> Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss I carried from thee dear and my true lip Hath virgin'd it e'er since <eos> You gods <eos> I prate And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted : sink my knee i' the earth Of thy deep duty more impression show Than that of common sons <eos> VOLUMNIA : O stand up blest <eos> Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint I kneel before thee and unproperly Show duty as mistaken all this while Between the child and parent <eos> CORIOLANUS : What is this <eos> Your knees to me <eos> to your corrected son <eos> Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach Fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun Murdering impossibility to make What cannot be slight work <eos> VOLUMNIA : Thou art my warrior I holp to frame thee <eos> Do you know this lady <eos> CORIOLANUS : The noble sister of Publicola The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle That's curdied by the frost from purest snow And hangs on Dian's temple : dear Valeria <eos> VOLUMNIA : This is a poor epitome of yours Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself <eos> CORIOLANUS : The god of soldiers With the consent of supreme Jove inform Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove To shame unvulnerable and stick i' the wars Like a great sea-mark standing every flaw And saving those that eye thee <eos> VOLUMNIA : Your knee sirrah <eos> CORIOLANUS : That's my brave boy <eos> VOLUMNIA : Even he your wife this lady and myself Are suitors to you <eos> CORIOLANUS : I beseech you peace : Or if you'ld ask remember this before : The thing I have forsworn to grant may never Be held by you denials <eos> Do not bid me Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate Again with Rome's mechanics : tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural : desire not To ally my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons <eos> VOLUMNIA : O no more no more <eos> You have said you will not grant us any thing For we have nothing else to ask but that Which you deny already : yet we will ask That if you fail in our request the blame May hang upon your hardness : therefore hear us <eos> CORIOLANUS : Aufidius and you Volsces mark for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private <eos> Your request <eos> VOLUMNIA : Should we be silent and not speak our raiment And state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile <eos> Think with thyself How more unfortunate than all living women Are we come hither : since that thy sight which should Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow Making the mother wife and child to see The son the husband and the father tearing His country's bowels out <eos> And to poor we Thine enmity's most capital : thou barr'st us Our prayers to the gods which is a comfort That all but we enjoy for how can we Alas how can we for our country pray <eos> Whereto we are bound together with thy victory Whereto we are bound <eos> alack or we must lose The country our dear nurse or else thy person Our comfort in the country <eos> We must find An evident calamity though we had Our wish which side should win : for either thou Must as a foreign recreant be led With manacles thorough our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin And bear the palm for having bravely shed Thy wife and children's blood <eos> For myself son I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine : if I cannot persuade thee Rather to show a noble grace to both parts Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread <eos> Trust to't thou shalt not <eos>on thy mother's womb That brought thee to this world <eos> VIRGILIA : Ay and mine That brought you forth this boy to keep your name Living to time <eos> Young MARCIUS : A' shall not tread on me I'll run away till I am bigger but then I'll fight <eos> CORIOLANUS : Not of a woman's tenderness to be Requires nor child nor woman's face to see <eos> I have sat too long <eos> VOLUMNIA : Nay go not from us thus <eos> If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us As poisonous of your honour : no our suit Is that you reconcile them : while the Volsces May say 'This mercy we have show'd' the Romans 'This we received' and each in either side Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest For making up this peace <eos>' Thou know'st great son The end of war's uncertain but this certain That if thou conquer Rome the benefit Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses Whose chronicle thus writ : 'The man was noble But with his last attempt he wiped it out Destroy'd his country and his name remains To the ensuing age abhorr'd <eos>' Speak to me son : Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour To imitate the graces of the gods To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak <eos> Why dost not speak <eos> Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs <eos> Daughter speak you : He cares not for your weeping <eos> Speak thou boy : Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons <eos> There's no man in the world More bound to 's mother yet here he lets me prate Like one i' the stocks <eos> Thou hast never in thy life Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy When she poor hen fond of no second brood Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home Loaden with honour <eos> Say my request's unjust And spurn me back : but if it be not so Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee That thou restrain'st from me the duty which To a mother's part belongs <eos> He turns away : Down ladies let us shame him with our knees <eos> To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride Than pity to our prayers <eos> Down : an end This is the last : so we will home to Rome And die among our neighbours <eos> Nay behold 's : This boy that cannot tell what he would have But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship Does reason our petition with more strength Than thou hast to deny 't <eos> Come let us go : This fellow had a Volscian to his mother His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance <eos> Yet give us our dispatch : I am hush'd until our city be a-fire And then I'll speak a little <eos> CORIOLANUS : O mother mother <eos> What have you done <eos> Behold the heavens do ope The gods look down and this unnatural scene They laugh at <eos> O my mother mother <eos> O <eos> You have won a happy victory to Rome But for your son <eos>believe it O believe it Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd If not most mortal to him <eos> But let it come <eos> Aufidius though I cannot make true wars I'll frame convenient peace <eos> Now good Aufidius Were you in my stead would you have heard A mother less <eos> or granted less Aufidius <eos> AUFIDIUS : I was moved withal <eos> CORIOLANUS : I dare be sworn you were : And sir it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion <eos> But good sir What peace you'll make advise me : for my part I'll not to Rome I'll back with you and pray you Stand to me in this cause <eos> O mother <eos> wife <eos> AUFIDIUS : CORIOLANUS : Ay by and by But we will drink together and you shall bear A better witness back than words which we On like conditions will have counter-seal'd <eos> Come enter with us <eos> Ladies you deserve To have a temple built you : all the swords In Italy and her confederate arms Could not have made this peace <eos> MENENIUS : See you yond coign o' the Capitol yond corner-stone <eos> SICINIUS : Why what of that <eos> MENENIUS : If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of Rome especially his mother may prevail with him <eos> But I say there is no hope in't : our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution <eos> SICINIUS : Is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man <eos> MENENIUS : There is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub <eos> This Marcius is grown from man to dragon : he has wings he's more than a creeping thing <eos> SICINIUS : He loved his mother dearly <eos> MENENIUS : So did he me : and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse <eos> The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes : when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading : he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery <eos> He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander <eos> What he bids be done is finished with his bidding <eos> He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in <eos> SICINIUS : Yes mercy if you report him truly <eos> MENENIUS : I paint him in the character <eos> Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him : there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find : and all this is long of you <eos> SICINIUS : The gods be good unto us <eos> MENENIUS : No in such a case the gods will not be good unto us <eos> When we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us <eos> Messenger : Sir if you'ld save your life fly to your house : The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune And hale him up and down all swearing if The Roman ladies bring not comfort home They'll give him death by inches <eos> SICINIUS : What's the news <eos> Second Messenger : Good news good news the ladies have prevail'd The Volscians are dislodged and Marcius gone : A merrier day did never yet greet Rome No not the expulsion of the Tarquins <eos> SICINIUS : Friend Art thou certain this is true <eos> is it most certain <eos> Second Messenger : As certain as I know the sun is fire : Where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it <eos> Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide As the recomforted through the gates <eos> Why hark you <eos> The trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans Make the sun dance <eos> Hark you <eos> MENENIUS : This is good news : I will go meet the ladies <eos> This Volumnia Is worth of consuls senators patricians A city full of tribunes such as you A sea and land full <eos> You have pray'd well to-day : This morning for ten thousand of your throats I'd not have given a doit <eos> Hark how they joy <eos> SICINIUS : First the gods bless you for your tidings next Accept my thankfulness <eos> Second Messenger : Sir we have all Great cause to give great thanks <eos> SICINIUS : They are near the city <eos> Second Messenger : Almost at point to enter <eos> SICINIUS : We will meet them And help the joy <eos> First Senator : Behold our patroness the life of Rome <eos> Call all your tribes together praise the gods And make triumphant fires strew flowers before them : Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius Repeal him with the welcome of his mother Cry 'Welcome ladies welcome <eos>' All : Welcome ladies Welcome <eos> AUFIDIUS : Go tell the lords o' the city I am here : Deliver them this paper : having read it Bid them repair to the market place where I Even in theirs and in the commons' ears Will vouch the truth of it <eos> Him I accuse The city ports by this hath enter'd and Intends to appear before the people hoping To purge herself with words : dispatch <eos> Most welcome <eos> First Conspirator : How is it with our general <eos> AUFIDIUS : Even so As with a man by his own alms empoison'd And with his charity slain <eos> Second Conspirator : Most noble sir If you do hold the same intent wherein You wish'd us parties we'll deliver you Of your great danger <eos> AUFIDIUS : Sir I cannot tell : We must proceed as we do find the people <eos> Third Conspirator : The people will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there's difference but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all <eos> AUFIDIUS : I know it And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction <eos> I raised him and I pawn'd Mine honour for his truth : who being so heighten'd He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery Seducing so my friends and to this end He bow'd his nature never known before But to be rough unswayable and free <eos> Third Conspirator : Sir his stoutness When he did stand for consul which he lost By lack of stooping <eos> AUFIDIUS : That I would have spoke of : Being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth Presented to my knife his throat : I took him Made him joint-servant with me gave him way In all his own desires nay let him choose Out of my files his projects to accomplish My best and freshest men served his designments In mine own person holp to reap the fame Which he did end all his and took some pride To do myself this wrong : till at the last I seem'd his follower not partner and He waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary <eos> First Conspirator : So he did my lord : The army marvell'd at it and in the last When he had carried Rome and that we look'd For no less spoil than glory <eos> AUFIDIUS : There was it : For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him <eos> At a few drops of women's rheum which are As cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour Of our great action : therefore shall he die And I'll renew me in his fall <eos> But hark <eos> First Conspirator : Your native town you enter'd like a post And had no welcomes home : but he returns Splitting the air with noise <eos> Second Conspirator : And patient fools Whose children he hath slain their base throats tear With giving him glory <eos> Third Conspirator : Therefore at your vantage Ere he express himself or move the people With what he would say let him feel your sword Which we will second <eos> When he lies along After your way his tale pronounced shall bury His reasons with his body <eos> AUFIDIUS : Say no more : Here come the lords <eos> All The Lords : You are most welcome home <eos> AUFIDIUS : I have not deserved it <eos> But worthy lords have you with heed perused What I have written to you <eos> Lords : We have <eos> First Lord : And grieve to hear't <eos> What faults he made before the last I think Might have found easy fines : but there to end Where he was to begin and give away The benefit of our levies answering us With our own charge making a treaty where There was a yielding <eos>this admits no excuse <eos> AUFIDIUS : He approaches : you shall hear him <eos> CORIOLANUS : Hail lords <eos> I am return'd your soldier No more infected with my country's love Than when I parted hence but still subsisting Under your great command <eos> You are to know That prosperously I have attempted and With bloody passage led your wars even to The gates of Rome <eos> Our spoils we have brought home Do more than counterpoise a full third part The charges of the action <eos> We have made peace With no less honour to the Antiates Than shame to the Romans : and we here deliver Subscribed by the consuls and patricians Together with the seal o' the senate what We have compounded on <eos> AUFIDIUS : Read it not noble lords But tell the traitor in the high'st degree He hath abused your powers <eos> CORIOLANUS : Traitor <eos> how now <eos> AUFIDIUS : Ay traitor Marcius <eos> CORIOLANUS : Marcius <eos> AUFIDIUS : Ay Marcius Caius Marcius : dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name Coriolanus in Corioli <eos> You lords and heads o' the state perfidiously He has betray'd your business and given up For certain drops of salt your city Rome I say 'your city' to his wife and mother Breaking his oath and resolution like A twist of rotten silk never admitting Counsel o' the war but at his nurse's tears He whined and roar'd away your victory That pages blush'd at him and men of heart Look'd wondering each at other <eos> CORIOLANUS : Hear'st thou Mars <eos> AUFIDIUS : Name not the god thou boy of tears <eos> CORIOLANUS : Ha <eos> AUFIDIUS : No more <eos> CORIOLANUS : Measureless liar thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it <eos> Boy <eos> O slave <eos> Pardon me lords 'tis the first time that ever I was forced to scold <eos> Your judgments my grave lords Must give this cur the lie : and his own notion <eos> Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him that Must bear my beating to his grave <eos>shall join To thrust the lie unto him <eos> First Lord : Peace both and hear me speak <eos> CORIOLANUS : Cut me to pieces Volsces men and lads Stain all your edges on me <eos> Boy <eos> false hound <eos> If you have writ your annals true 'tis there That like an eagle in a dove-cote I Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli : Alone I did it <eos> Boy <eos> AUFIDIUS : Why noble lords Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune Which was your shame by this unholy braggart 'Fore your own eyes and ears <eos> All Conspirators : Let him die for't <eos> All The People : 'Tear him to pieces <eos>' 'Do it presently <eos>' 'He kill'd my son <eos>' 'My daughter <eos>' 'He killed my cousin Marcus <eos>' 'He killed my father <eos>' Second Lord : Peace ho <eos> no outrage : peace <eos> The man is noble and his fame folds-in This orb o' the earth <eos> His last offences to us Shall have judicious hearing <eos> Stand Aufidius And trouble not the peace <eos> CORIOLANUS : O that I had him With six Aufidiuses or more his tribe To use my lawful sword <eos> AUFIDIUS : Insolent villain <eos> All Conspirators : Kill kill kill kill kill him <eos> Lords : Hold hold hold hold <eos> AUFIDIUS : My noble masters hear me speak <eos> First Lord : O Tullus <eos> Second Lord : Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep <eos> Third Lord : Tread not upon him <eos> Masters all be quiet Put up your swords <eos> AUFIDIUS : My lords when you shall know <eos>as in this rage Provoked by him you cannot <eos>the great danger Which this man's life did owe you you'll rejoice That he is thus cut off <eos> Please it your honours To call me to your senate I'll deliver Myself your loyal servant or endure Your heaviest censure <eos> First Lord : Bear from hence his body And mourn you for him : let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his urn <eos> Second Lord : His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame <eos> Let's make the best of it <eos> AUFIDIUS : My rage is gone And I am struck with sorrow <eos> Take him up <eos> Help three o' the chiefest soldiers I'll be one <eos> Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully : Trail your steel pikes <eos> Though in this city he Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one Which to this hour bewail the injury Yet he shall have a noble memory <eos> Assist <eos> GLOUCESTER : Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried <eos> Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths Our bruised arms hung up for monuments Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings Our dreadful marches to delightful measures <eos> Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front And now instead of mounting barded steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute <eos> But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass I that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph I that am curtail'd of this fair proportion Cheated of feature by dissembling nature Deformed unfinish'd sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them Why I in this weak piping time of peace Have no delight to pass away the time Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity : And therefore since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days <eos> Plots have I laid inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate the one against the other : And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle false and treacherous This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up About a prophecy which says that 'G' Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be <eos> Dive thoughts down to my soul : here Clarence comes <eos> Brother good day what means this armed guard That waits upon your grace <eos> CLARENCE : His majesty Tendering my person's safety hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower <eos> GLOUCESTER : Upon what cause <eos> CLARENCE : Because my name is George <eos> GLOUCESTER : Alack my lord that fault is none of yours He should for that commit your godfathers : O belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower <eos> But what's the matter Clarence <eos> may I know <eos> CLARENCE : Yea Richard when I know for I protest As yet I do not : but as I can learn He hearkens after prophecies and dreams And from the cross-row plucks the letter G <eos> And says a wizard told him that by G His issue disinherited should be And for my name of George begins with G It follows in his thought that I am he <eos> These as I learn and such like toys as these Have moved his highness to commit me now <eos> GLOUCESTER : Why this it is when men are ruled by women : 'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower : My Lady Grey his wife Clarence 'tis she That tempers him to this extremity <eos> Was it not she and that good man of worship Anthony Woodville her brother there That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower From whence this present day he is deliver'd <eos> We are not safe Clarence we are not safe <eos> CLARENCE : By heaven I think there's no man is secure But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore <eos> Heard ye not what an humble suppliant Lord hastings was to her for his delivery <eos> GLOUCESTER : Humbly complaining to her deity Got my lord chamberlain his liberty <eos> I'll tell you what I think it is our way If we will keep in favour with the king To be her men and wear her livery : The jealous o'erworn widow and herself Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen <eos> Are mighty gossips in this monarchy <eos> BRAKENBURY : I beseech your graces both to pardon me His majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference Of what degree soever with his brother <eos> GLOUCESTER : Even so an't please your worship Brakenbury You may partake of any thing we say : We speak no treason man : we say the king Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen Well struck in years fair and not jealous We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks : How say you sir <eos> Can you deny all this <eos> BRAKENBURY : With this my lord myself have nought to do <eos> GLOUCESTER : Naught to do with mistress Shore <eos> I tell thee fellow He that doth naught with her excepting one Were best he do it secretly alone <eos> BRAKENBURY : What one my lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : Her husband knave : wouldst thou betray me <eos> BRAKENBURY : I beseech your grace to pardon me and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke <eos> CLARENCE : We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey <eos> GLOUCESTER : We are the queen's abjects and must obey <eos> Brother farewell : I will unto the king And whatsoever you will employ me in Were it to call King Edward's widow sister I will perform it to enfranchise you <eos> Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagine <eos> CLARENCE : I know it pleaseth neither of us well <eos> GLOUCESTER : Well your imprisonment shall not be long Meantime have patience <eos> CLARENCE : I must perforce <eos> Farewell <eos> GLOUCESTER : Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return <eos> Simple plain Clarence <eos> I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven If heaven will take the present at our hands <eos> But who comes here <eos> the new-deliver'd Hastings <eos> HASTINGS : Good time of day unto my gracious lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : As much unto my good lord chamberlain <eos> Well are you welcome to the open air <eos> How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment <eos> HASTINGS : With patience noble lord as prisoners must : But I shall live my lord to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonment <eos> GLOUCESTER : No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too For they that were your enemies are his And have prevail'd as much on him as you <eos> HASTINGS : More pity that the eagle should be mew'd While kites and buzzards prey at liberty <eos> GLOUCESTER : What news abroad <eos> HASTINGS : No news so bad abroad as this at home The King is sickly weak and melancholy And his physicians fear him mightily <eos> GLOUCESTER : Now by Saint Paul this news is bad indeed <eos> O he hath kept an evil diet long And overmuch consumed his royal person : 'Tis very grievous to be thought upon <eos> What is he in his bed <eos> HASTINGS : He is <eos> GLOUCESTER : Go you before and I will follow you <eos> He cannot live I hope and must not die Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven <eos> I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments And if I fall not in my deep intent Clarence hath not another day to live : Which done God take King Edward to his mercy And leave the world for me to bustle in <eos> For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter <eos> What though I kill'd her husband and her father <eos> The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father : The which will I not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto <eos> But yet I run before my horse to market : Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns : When they are gone then must I count my gains <eos> LADY ANNE : Set down set down your honourable load If honour may be shrouded in a hearse Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster <eos> Poor key-cold figure of a holy king <eos> Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster <eos> Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood <eos> Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughter'd son Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds <eos> Lo in these windows that let forth thy life I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes <eos> Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes <eos> Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it <eos> Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence <eos> More direful hap betide that hated wretch That makes us wretched by the death of thee Than I can wish to adders spiders toads Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives <eos> If ever he have child abortive be it Prodigious and untimely brought to light Whose ugly and unnatural aspect May fright the hopeful mother at the view And that be heir to his unhappiness <eos> If ever he have wife let her he made A miserable by the death of him As I am made by my poor lord and thee <eos> Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load Taken from Paul's to be interred there And still as you are weary of the weight Rest you whiles I lament King Henry's corse <eos> GLOUCESTER : Stay you that bear the corse and set it down <eos> LADY ANNE : What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds <eos> GLOUCESTER : Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul I'll make a corse of him that disobeys <eos> Gentleman : My lord stand back and let the coffin pass <eos> GLOUCESTER : Unmanner'd dog <eos> stand thou when I command : Advance thy halbert higher than my breast Or by Saint Paul I'll strike thee to my foot And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness <eos> LADY ANNE : What do you tremble <eos> are you all afraid <eos> Alas I blame you not for you are mortal And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil <eos> Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell <eos> Thou hadst but power over his mortal body His soul thou canst not have therefore be gone <eos> GLOUCESTER : Sweet saint for charity be not so curst <eos> LADY ANNE : Foul devil for God's sake hence and trouble us not For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims <eos> If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds Behold this pattern of thy butcheries <eos> O gentlemen see see <eos> dead Henry's wounds Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh <eos> Blush Blush thou lump of foul deformity For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells Thy deed inhuman and unnatural Provokes this deluge most unnatural <eos> O God which this blood madest revenge his death <eos> O earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death <eos> Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered <eos> GLOUCESTER : Lady you know no rules of charity Which renders good for bad blessings for curses <eos> LADY ANNE : Villain thou know'st no law of God nor man : No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity <eos> GLOUCESTER : But I know none and therefore am no beast <eos> LADY ANNE : O wonderful when devils tell the truth <eos> GLOUCESTER : More wonderful when angels are so angry <eos> Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman Of these supposed-evils to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself <eos> LADY ANNE : Vouchsafe defused infection of a man For these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursed self <eos> GLOUCESTER : Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself <eos> LADY ANNE : Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself <eos> GLOUCESTER : By such despair I should accuse myself <eos> LADY ANNE : And by despairing shouldst thou stand excused For doing worthy vengeance on thyself Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others <eos> GLOUCESTER : Say that I slew them not <eos> LADY ANNE : Why then they are not dead : But dead they are and devilish slave by thee <eos> GLOUCESTER : I did not kill your husband <eos> LADY ANNE : Why then he is alive <eos> GLOUCESTER : Nay he is dead and slain by Edward's hand <eos> LADY ANNE : In thy foul throat thou liest : Queen Margaret saw Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood The which thou once didst bend against her breast But that thy brothers beat aside the point <eos> GLOUCESTER : I was provoked by her slanderous tongue which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders <eos> LADY ANNE : Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind <eos> Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries : Didst thou not kill this king <eos> GLOUCESTER : I grant ye <eos> LADY ANNE : Dost grant me hedgehog <eos> then God grant me too Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed <eos> O he was gentle mild and virtuous <eos> GLOUCESTER : The fitter for the King of heaven that hath him <eos> LADY ANNE : He is in heaven where thou shalt never come <eos> GLOUCESTER : Let him thank me that holp to send him thither For he was fitter for that place than earth <eos> LADY ANNE : And thou unfit for any place but hell <eos> GLOUCESTER : Yes one place else if you will hear me name it <eos> LADY ANNE : Some dungeon <eos> GLOUCESTER : Your bed-chamber <eos> LADY ANNE : I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest <eos> GLOUCESTER : So will it madam till I lie with you <eos> LADY ANNE : I hope so <eos> GLOUCESTER : I know so <eos> But gentle Lady Anne To leave this keen encounter of our wits And fall somewhat into a slower method Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward As blameful as the executioner <eos> LADY ANNE : Thou art the cause and most accursed effect <eos> GLOUCESTER : Your beauty was the cause of that effect Your beauty : which did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom <eos> LADY ANNE : If I thought that I tell thee homicide These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks <eos> GLOUCESTER : These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck You should not blemish it if I stood by : As all the world is cheered by the sun So I by that it is my day my life <eos> LADY ANNE : Black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life <eos> GLOUCESTER : Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both <eos> LADY ANNE : I would I were to be revenged on thee <eos> GLOUCESTER : It is a quarrel most unnatural To be revenged on him that loveth you <eos> LADY ANNE : It is a quarrel just and reasonable To be revenged on him that slew my husband <eos> GLOUCESTER : He that bereft thee lady of thy husband Did it to help thee to a better husband <eos> LADY ANNE : His better doth not breathe upon the earth <eos> GLOUCESTER : He lives that loves thee better than he could <eos> LADY ANNE : Name him <eos> GLOUCESTER : Plantagenet <eos> LADY ANNE : Why that was he <eos> GLOUCESTER : The selfsame name but one of better nature <eos> LADY ANNE : Where is he <eos> GLOUCESTER : Here <eos> Why dost thou spit at me <eos> LADY ANNE : Would it were mortal poison for thy sake <eos> GLOUCESTER : Never came poison from so sweet a place <eos> LADY ANNE : Never hung poison on a fouler toad <eos> Out of my sight <eos> thou dost infect my eyes <eos> GLOUCESTER : Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine <eos> LADY ANNE : Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead <eos> GLOUCESTER : I would they were that I might die at once For now they kill me with a living death <eos> Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops : These eyes that never shed remorseful tear No when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him Nor when thy warlike father like a child Told the sad story of my father's death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks Like trees bedash'd with rain : in that sad time My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping <eos> I never sued to friend nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word But now thy beauty is proposed my fee My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak <eos> Teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made For kissing lady not for such contempt <eos> If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom <eos> And let the soul forth that adoreth thee I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee <eos> Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me <eos> Nay now dispatch 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on <eos> Take up the sword again or take up me <eos> LADY ANNE : Arise dissembler : though I wish thy death I will not be the executioner <eos> GLOUCESTER : Then bid me kill myself and I will do it <eos> LADY ANNE : I have already <eos> GLOUCESTER : Tush that was in thy rage : Speak it again and even with the word That hand which for thy love did kill thy love Shall for thy love kill a far truer love To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary <eos> LADY ANNE : I would I knew thy heart <eos> GLOUCESTER : 'Tis figured in my tongue <eos> LADY ANNE : I fear me both are false <eos> GLOUCESTER : Then never man was true <eos> LADY ANNE : Well well put up your sword <eos> GLOUCESTER : Say then my peace is made <eos> LADY ANNE : That shall you know hereafter <eos> GLOUCESTER : But shall I live in hope <eos> LADY ANNE : All men I hope live so <eos> GLOUCESTER : Vouchsafe to wear this ring <eos> LADY ANNE : To take is not to give <eos> GLOUCESTER : Look how this ring encompasseth finger <eos> Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart Wear both of them for both of them are thine <eos> And if thy poor devoted suppliant may But beg one favour at thy gracious hand Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever <eos> LADY ANNE : What is it <eos> GLOUCESTER : That it would please thee leave these sad designs To him that hath more cause to be a mourner And presently repair to Crosby Place Where after I have solemnly interr'd At Chertsey monastery this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears I will with all expedient duty see you : For divers unknown reasons <eos> I beseech you Grant me this boon <eos> LADY ANNE : With all my heart and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent <eos> Tressel and Berkeley go along with me <eos> GLOUCESTER : Bid me farewell <eos> LADY ANNE : 'Tis more than you deserve But since you teach me how to flatter you Imagine I have said farewell already <eos> GLOUCESTER : Sirs take up the corse <eos> GENTLEMEN : Towards Chertsey noble lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : No to White-Friars there attend my coining <eos> Was ever woman in this humour woo'd <eos> Was ever woman in this humour won <eos> I'll have her but I will not keep her long <eos> What <eos> I that kill'd her husband and his father To take her in her heart's extremest hate With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes The bleeding witness of her hatred by Having God her conscience and these bars against me And I nothing to back my suit at all But the plain devil and dissembling looks And yet to win her all the world to nothing <eos> Ha <eos> Hath she forgot already that brave prince Edward her lord whom I some three months since Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury <eos> A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman Framed in the prodigality of nature Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal The spacious world cannot again afford And will she yet debase her eyes on me That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woful bed <eos> On me whose all not equals Edward's moiety <eos> On me that halt and am unshapen thus <eos> My dukedom to a beggarly denier I do mistake my person all this while : Upon my life she finds although I cannot Myself to be a marvellous proper man <eos> I'll be at charges for a looking-glass And entertain some score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body : Since I am crept in favour with myself Will maintain it with some little cost <eos> But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love <eos> Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass That I may see my shadow as I pass <eos> RIVERS : Have patience madam : there's no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustom'd health <eos> GREY : In that you brook it in it makes him worse : Therefore for God's sake entertain good comfort And cheer his grace with quick and merry words <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : If he were dead what would betide of me <eos> RIVERS : No other harm but loss of such a lord <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : The loss of such a lord includes all harm <eos> GREY : The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son To be your comforter when he is gone <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Oh he is young and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester A man that loves not me nor none of you <eos> RIVERS : Is it concluded that he shall be protector <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : It is determined not concluded yet : But so it must be if the king miscarry <eos> GREY : Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Good time of day unto your royal grace <eos> DERBY : God make your majesty joyful as you have been <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : The Countess Richmond good my Lord of Derby <eos> To your good prayers will scarcely say amen <eos> Yet Derby notwithstanding she's your wife And loves not me be you good lord assured I hate not you for her proud arrogance <eos> DERBY : I do beseech you either not believe The envious slanders of her false accusers Or if she be accused in true report Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds From wayward sickness and no grounded malice <eos> RIVERS : Saw you the king to-day my Lord of Derby <eos> DERBY : But now the Duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his majesty <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : What likelihood of his amendment lords <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : God grant him health <eos> Did you confer with him <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Madam we did : he desires to make atonement Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain And sent to warn them to his royal presence <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Would all were well <eos> but that will never be I fear our happiness is at the highest <eos> GLOUCESTER : They do me wrong and I will not endure it : Who are they that complain unto the king That I forsooth am stern and love them not <eos> By holy Paul they love his grace but lightly That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours <eos> Because I cannot flatter and speak fair Smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog Duck with French nods and apish courtesy I must be held a rancorous enemy <eos> Cannot a plain man live and think no harm But thus his simple truth must be abused By silken sly insinuating Jacks <eos> RIVERS : To whom in all this presence speaks your grace <eos> GLOUCESTER : To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace <eos> When have I injured thee <eos> when done thee wrong <eos> Or thee <eos> or thee <eos> or any of your faction <eos> A plague upon you all <eos> His royal person <eos> Whom God preserve better than you would wish <eos> <eos> Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Brother of Gloucester you mistake the matter <eos> The king of his own royal disposition And not provoked by any suitor else Aiming belike at your interior hatred Which in your outward actions shows itself Against my kindred brothers and myself Makes him to send that thereby he may gather The ground of your ill-will and so remove it <eos> GLOUCESTER : I cannot tell : the world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch : Since every Jack became a gentleman There's many a gentle person made a Jack <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Come come we know your meaning brother Gloucester You envy my advancement and my friends' : God grant we never may have need of you <eos> GLOUCESTER : Meantime God grants that we have need of you : Your brother is imprison'd by your means Myself disgraced and the nobility Held in contempt whilst many fair promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoy'd I never did incense his majesty Against the Duke of Clarence but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him <eos> My lord you do me shameful injury Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects <eos> GLOUCESTER : You may deny that you were not the cause Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment <eos> RIVERS : She may my lord for <eos> GLOUCESTER : She may Lord Rivers <eos> why who knows not so <eos> She may do more sir than denying that : She may help you to many fair preferments And then deny her aiding hand therein And lay those honours on your high deserts <eos> What may she not <eos> She may yea marry may she <eos> RIVERS : What marry may she <eos> GLOUCESTER : What marry may she <eos> marry with a king A bachelor a handsome stripling too : I wis your grandam had a worser match <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : My Lord of Gloucester I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs : By heaven I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts I often have endured <eos> I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition To be thus taunted scorn'd and baited at : Small joy have I in being England's queen <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : And lessen'd be that small God I beseech thee <eos> Thy honour state and seat is due to me <eos> GLOUCESTER : What <eos> threat you me with telling of the king <eos> Tell him and spare not : look what I have said I will avouch in presence of the king : I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower <eos> 'Tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Out devil <eos> I remember them too well : Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury <eos> GLOUCESTER : Ere you were queen yea or your husband king I was a pack-horse in his great affairs A weeder-out of his proud adversaries A liberal rewarder of his friends : To royalize his blood I spilt mine own <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Yea and much better blood than his or thine <eos> GLOUCESTER : In all which time you and your husband Grey Were factious for the house of Lancaster And Rivers so were you <eos> Was not your husband In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain <eos> Let me put in your minds if you forget What you have been ere now and what you are Withal what I have been and what I am <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : A murderous villain and so still thou art <eos> GLOUCESTER : Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick Yea and forswore himself <eos>which Jesu pardon <eos> <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Which God revenge <eos> GLOUCESTER : To fight on Edward's party for the crown And for his meed poor lord he is mew'd up <eos> I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine I am too childish-foolish for this world <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world Thou cacodemon <eos> there thy kingdom is <eos> RIVERS : My Lord of Gloucester in those busy days Which here you urge to prove us enemies We follow'd then our lord our lawful king : So should we you if you should be our king <eos> GLOUCESTER : If I should be <eos> I had rather be a pedlar : Far be it from my heart the thought of it <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : As little joy my lord as you suppose You should enjoy were you this country's king As little joy may you suppose in me <eos> That I enjoy being the queen thereof <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : A little joy enjoys the queen thereof For I am she and altogether joyless <eos> I can no longer hold me patient <eos> Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out In sharing that which you have pill'd from me <eos> Which of you trembles not that looks on me <eos> If not that I being queen you bow like subjects Yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels <eos> O gentle villain do not turn away <eos> GLOUCESTER : Foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : But repetition of what thou hast marr'd That will I make before I let thee go <eos> GLOUCESTER : Wert thou not banished on pain of death <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : I was but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode <eos> A husband and a son thou owest to me And thou a kingdom all of you allegiance : The sorrow that I have by right is yours And all the pleasures you usurp are mine <eos> GLOUCESTER : The curse my noble father laid on thee When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes And then to dry them gavest the duke a clout Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland <eos> His curses then from bitterness of soul Denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee And God not we hath plagued thy bloody deed <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : So just is God to right the innocent <eos> HASTINGS : O 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe And the most merciless that e'er was heard of <eos> RIVERS : Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported <eos> DORSET : No man but prophesied revenge for it <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Northumberland then present wept to see it <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : What were you snarling all before I came Ready to catch each other by the throat And turn you all your hatred now on me <eos> Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven <eos> That Henry's death my lovely Edward's death Their kingdom's loss my woful banishment Could all but answer for that peevish brat <eos> Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven <eos> Why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses <eos> If not by war by surfeit die your king As ours by murder to make him a king <eos> Edward thy son which now is Prince of Wales For Edward my son which was Prince of Wales Die in his youth by like untimely violence <eos> Thyself a queen for me that was a queen Outlive thy glory like my wretched self <eos> Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss And see another as I see thee now Deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine <eos> Long die thy happy days before thy death And after many lengthen'd hours of grief Die neither mother wife nor England's queen <eos> Rivers and Dorset you were standers by And so wast thou Lord Hastings when my son Was stabb'd with bloody daggers : God I pray him That none of you may live your natural age But by some unlook'd accident cut off <eos> GLOUCESTER : Have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : And leave out thee <eos> stay dog for thou shalt hear me <eos> If heaven have any grievous plague in store Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe And then hurl down their indignation On thee the troubler of the poor world's peace <eos> The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul <eos> Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends <eos> No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils <eos> Thou elvish-mark'd abortive rooting hog <eos> Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity The slave of nature and the son of hell <eos> Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb <eos> Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins <eos> Thou rag of honour <eos> thou detested <eos> GLOUCESTER : Margaret <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Richard <eos> GLOUCESTER : Ha <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : I call thee not <eos> GLOUCESTER : I cry thee mercy then for I had thought That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Why so I did but look'd for no reply <eos> O let me make the period to my curse <eos> GLOUCESTER : 'Tis done by me and ends in 'Margaret <eos>' QUEEN ELIZABETH : Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune <eos> Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about <eos> Fool fool <eos> thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself <eos> The time will come when thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad <eos> HASTINGS : False-boding woman end thy frantic curse Lest to thy harm thou move our patience <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Foul shame upon you <eos> you have all moved mine <eos> RIVERS : Were you well served you would be taught your duty <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : To serve me well you all should do me duty Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects : O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty <eos> DORSET : Dispute not with her she is lunatic <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Peace master marquess you are malapert : Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current <eos> O that your young nobility could judge What 'twere to lose it and be miserable <eos> They that stand high have many blasts to shake them And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces <eos> GLOUCESTER : Good counsel marry : learn it learn it marquess <eos> DORSET : It toucheth you my lord as much as me <eos> GLOUCESTER : Yea and much more : but I was born so high Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : And turns the sun to shade alas <eos> alas <eos> Witness my son now in the shade of death Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath Hath in eternal darkness folded up <eos> Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest <eos> O God that seest it do not suffer it <eos> As it was won with blood lost be it so <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Have done <eos> for shame if not for charity <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Urge neither charity nor shame to me : Uncharitably with me have you dealt And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd <eos> My charity is outrage life my shame And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Have done have done <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand In sign of league and amity with thee : Now fair befal thee and thy noble house <eos> Thy garments are not spotted with our blood Nor thou within the compass of my curse <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Nor no one here for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : I'll not believe but they ascend the sky And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace <eos> O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog <eos> Look when he fawns he bites and when he bites His venom tooth will rankle to the death : Have not to do with him beware of him Sin death and hell have set their marks on him And all their ministers attend on him <eos> GLOUCESTER : What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Nothing that I respect my gracious lord <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : What dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel <eos> And soothe the devil that I warn thee from <eos> O but remember this another day When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow And say poor Margaret was a prophetess <eos> Live each of you the subjects to his hate And he to yours and all of you to God's <eos> HASTINGS : My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses <eos> RIVERS : And so doth mine : I muse why she's at liberty <eos> GLOUCESTER : I cannot blame her : by God's holy mother She hath had too much wrong and I repent My part thereof that I have done to her <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : I never did her any to my knowledge <eos> GLOUCESTER : But you have all the vantage of her wrong <eos> I was too hot to do somebody good That is too cold in thinking of it now <eos> Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains God pardon them that are the cause of it <eos> RIVERS : A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion To pray for them that have done scathe to us <eos> GLOUCESTER : So do I ever : being well-advised <eos> For had I cursed now I had cursed myself <eos> CATESBY : Madam his majesty doth call for you And for your grace and you my noble lords <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Catesby we come <eos> Lords will you go with us <eos> RIVERS : Madam we will attend your grace <eos> GLOUCESTER : I do the wrong and first begin to brawl <eos> The secret mischiefs that I set abroach I lay unto the grievous charge of others <eos> Clarence whom I indeed have laid in darkness I do beweep to many simple gulls Namely to Hastings Derby Buckingham And say it is the queen and her allies That stir the king against the duke my brother <eos> Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers Vaughan Grey : But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture Tell them that God bids us do good for evil : And thus I clothe my naked villany With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ And seem a saint when most I play the devil <eos> But soft <eos> here come my executioners <eos> How now my hardy stout resolved mates <eos> Are you now going to dispatch this deed <eos> First Murderer : We are my lord and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is <eos> GLOUCESTER : Well thought upon I have it here about me <eos> When you have done repair to Crosby Place <eos> But sirs be sudden in the execution Withal obdurate do not hear him plead For Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps May move your hearts to pity if you mark him <eos> First Murderer : Tush <eos> Fear not my lord we will not stand to prate Talkers are no good doers : be assured We come to use our hands and not our tongues <eos> GLOUCESTER : Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes drop tears : I like you lads about your business straight Go go dispatch <eos> First Murderer : We will my noble lord <eos> BRAKENBURY : Why looks your grace so heavily today <eos> CLARENCE : O I have pass'd a miserable night So full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams That as I am a Christian faithful man I would not spend another such a night Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days So full of dismal terror was the time <eos> BRAKENBURY : What was your dream <eos> I long to hear you tell it <eos> CLARENCE : Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy And in my company my brother Gloucester Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches : thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us <eos> As we paced along Upon the giddy footing of the hatches Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling Struck me that thought to stay him overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main <eos> Lord Lord <eos> methought what pain it was to drown <eos> What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears <eos> What ugly sights of death within mine eyes <eos> Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl Inestimable stones unvalued jewels All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea : Some lay in dead men's skulls and in those holes Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept As 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by <eos> BRAKENBURY : Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep <eos> CLARENCE : Methought I had and often did I strive To yield the ghost : but still the envious flood Kept in my soul and would not let it forth To seek the empty vast and wandering air But smother'd it within my panting bulk Which almost burst to belch it in the sea <eos> BRAKENBURY : Awaked you not with this sore agony <eos> CLARENCE : O no my dream was lengthen'd after life O then began the tempest to my soul Who pass'd methought the melancholy flood With that grim ferryman which poets write of Unto the kingdom of perpetual night <eos> The first that there did greet my stranger soul Was my great father-in-law renowned Warwick Who cried aloud 'What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence <eos>' And so he vanish'd : then came wandering by A shadow like an angel with bright hair Dabbled in blood and he squeak'd out aloud 'Clarence is come false fleeting perjured Clarence That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury Seize on him Furies take him to your torments <eos>' With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends Environ'd me about and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling waked and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell Such terrible impression made the dream <eos> BRAKENBURY : No marvel my lord though it affrighted you I promise I am afraid to hear you tell it <eos> CLARENCE : O Brakenbury I have done those things Which now bear evidence against my soul For Edward's sake and see how he requites me <eos> O God <eos> if my deep prayers cannot appease thee But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds Yet execute thy wrath in me alone O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children <eos> I pray thee gentle keeper stay by me My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep <eos> BRAKENBURY : I will my lord : God give your grace good rest <eos> Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours Makes the night morning and the noon-tide night <eos> Princes have but their tides for their glories An outward honour for an inward toil And for unfelt imagination They often feel a world of restless cares : So that betwixt their tides and low names There's nothing differs but the outward fame <eos> First Murderer : Ho <eos> who's here <eos> BRAKENBURY : In God's name what are you and how came you hither <eos> First Murderer : I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs <eos> BRAKENBURY : Yea are you so brief <eos> Second Murderer : O sir it is better to be brief than tedious <eos> Show him our commission talk no more <eos> BRAKENBURY : I am in this commanded to deliver The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands : I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless of the meaning <eos> Here are the keys there sits the duke asleep : I'll to the king and signify to him That thus I have resign'd my charge to you <eos> First Murderer : Do so it is a point of wisdom : fare you well <eos> Second Murderer : What shall we stab him as he sleeps <eos> First Murderer : No then he will say 'twas done cowardly when he wakes <eos> Second Murderer : When he wakes <eos> why fool he shall never wake till the judgment-day <eos> First Murderer : Why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping <eos> Second Murderer : The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind of remorse in me <eos> First Murderer : What art thou afraid <eos> Second Murderer : Not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us <eos> First Murderer : I thought thou hadst been resolute <eos> Second Murderer : So I am to let him live <eos> First Murderer : Back to the Duke of Gloucester tell him so <eos> Second Murderer : I pray thee stay a while : I hope my holy humour will change 'twas wont to hold me but while one would tell twenty <eos> First Murderer : How dost thou feel thyself now <eos> Second Murderer : 'Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me <eos> First Murderer : Remember our reward when the deed is done <eos> Second Murderer : 'Zounds he dies : I had forgot the reward <eos> First Murderer : Where is thy conscience now <eos> Second Murderer : In the Duke of Gloucester's purse <eos> First Murderer : So when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out <eos> Second Murderer : Let it go there's few or none will entertain it <eos> First Murderer : How if it come to thee again <eos> Second Murderer : I'll not meddle with it : it is a dangerous thing : it makes a man a coward : a man cannot steal but it accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it detects him : 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom it fills one full of obstacles : it made me once restore a purse of gold that I found it beggars any man that keeps it : it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it <eos> First Murderer : 'Zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke <eos> Second Murderer : Take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not : he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh <eos> First Murderer : Tut I am strong-framed he cannot prevail with me I warrant thee <eos> Second Murderer : Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his reputation <eos> Come shall we to this gear <eos> First Murderer : Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt in the next room <eos> Second Murderer : O excellent devise <eos> make a sop of him <eos> First Murderer : Hark <eos> he stirs : shall I strike <eos> Second Murderer : No first let's reason with him <eos> CLARENCE : Where art thou keeper <eos> give me a cup of wine <eos> Second murderer : You shall have wine enough my lord anon <eos> CLARENCE : In God's name what art thou <eos> Second Murderer : A man as you are <eos> CLARENCE : But not as I am royal <eos> Second Murderer : Nor you as we are loyal <eos> CLARENCE : Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble <eos> Second Murderer : My voice is now the king's my looks mine own <eos> CLARENCE : How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak <eos> Your eyes do menace me : why look you pale <eos> Who sent you hither <eos> Wherefore do you come <eos> Both : To to to <eos> CLARENCE : To murder me <eos> Both : Ay ay <eos> CLARENCE : You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it <eos> Wherein my friends have I offended you <eos> First Murderer : Offended us you have not but the king <eos> CLARENCE : I shall be reconciled to him again <eos> Second Murderer : Never my lord therefore prepare to die <eos> CLARENCE : Are you call'd forth from out a world of men To slay the innocent <eos> What is my offence <eos> Where are the evidence that do accuse me <eos> What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge <eos> or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death <eos> Before I be convict by course of law To threaten me with death is most unlawful <eos> I charge you as you hope to have redemption By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins That you depart and lay no hands on me The deed you undertake is damnable <eos> First Murderer : What we will do we do upon command <eos> Second Murderer : And he that hath commanded is the king <eos> CLARENCE : Erroneous vassal <eos> the great King of kings Hath in the tables of his law commanded That thou shalt do no murder : and wilt thou then Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's <eos> Take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands To hurl upon their heads that break his law <eos> Second Murderer : And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too : Thou didst receive the holy sacrament To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster <eos> First Murderer : And like a traitor to the name of God Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son <eos> Second Murderer : Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend <eos> First Murderer : How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in so dear degree <eos> CLARENCE : Alas <eos> for whose sake did I that ill deed <eos> For Edward for my brother for his sake : Why sirs He sends ye not to murder me for this For in this sin he is as deep as I <eos> If God will be revenged for this deed <eos> O know you yet he doth it publicly Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm He needs no indirect nor lawless course To cut off those that have offended him <eos> First Murderer : Who made thee then a bloody minister When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet That princely novice was struck dead by thee <eos> CLARENCE : My brother's love the devil and my rage <eos> First Murderer : Thy brother's love our duty and thy fault Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee <eos> CLARENCE : Oh if you love my brother hate not me I am his brother and I love him well <eos> If you be hired for meed go back again And I will send you to my brother Gloucester Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death <eos> Second Murderer : You are deceived your brother Gloucester hates you <eos> CLARENCE : O no he loves me and he holds me dear : Go you to him from me <eos> Both : Ay so we will <eos> CLARENCE : Tell him when that our princely father York Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm And charged us from his soul to love each other He little thought of this divided friendship : Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep <eos> First Murderer : Ay millstones as be lesson'd us to weep <eos> CLARENCE : O do not slander him for he is kind <eos> First Murderer : Right As snow in harvest <eos> Thou deceivest thyself : 'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee <eos> CLARENCE : It cannot be for when I parted with him He hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs That he would labour my delivery <eos> Second Murderer : Why so he doth now he delivers thee From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven <eos> First Murderer : Make peace with God for you must die my lord <eos> CLARENCE : Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul To counsel me to make my peace with God And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind That thou wilt war with God by murdering me <eos> Ah sirs consider he that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed <eos> Second Murderer : What shall we do <eos> CLARENCE : Relent and save your souls <eos> First Murderer : Relent <eos> 'tis cowardly and womanish <eos> CLARENCE : Not to relent is beastly savage devilish <eos> Which of you if you were a prince's son Being pent from liberty as I am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you Would not entreat for life <eos> My friend I spy some pity in thy looks : O if thine eye be not a flatterer Come thou on my side and entreat for me As you would beg were you in my distress A begging prince what beggar pities not <eos> Second Murderer : Look behind you my lord <eos> First Murderer : Take that and that : if all this will not do I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within <eos> Second Murderer : A bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd <eos> How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands Of this most grievous guilty murder done <eos> First Murderer : How now <eos> what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not <eos> By heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art <eos> Second Murderer : I would he knew that I had saved his brother <eos> Take thou the fee and tell him what I say For I repent me that the duke is slain <eos> First Murderer : So do not I : go coward as thou art <eos> Now must I hide his body in some hole Until the duke take order for his burial : And when I have my meed I must away For this will out and here I must not stay <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Why so : now have I done a good day's work : You peers continue this united league : I every day expect an embassage From my Redeemer to redeem me hence And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven Since I have set my friends at peace on earth <eos> Rivers and Hastings take each other's hand Dissemble not your hatred swear your love <eos> RIVERS : By heaven my heart is purged from grudging hate : And with my hand I seal my true heart's love <eos> HASTINGS : So thrive I as I truly swear the like <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Take heed you dally not before your king Lest he that is the supreme King of kings Confound your hidden falsehood and award Either of you to be the other's end <eos> HASTINGS : So prosper I as I swear perfect love <eos> RIVERS : And I as I love Hastings with my heart <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Madam yourself are not exempt in this Nor your son Dorset Buckingham nor you You have been factious one against the other Wife love Lord Hastings let him kiss your hand And what you do do it unfeignedly <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Here Hastings I will never more remember Our former hatred so thrive I and mine <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Dorset embrace him Hastings love lord marquess <eos> DORSET : This interchange of love I here protest Upon my part shall be unviolable <eos> HASTINGS : And so swear I my lord KING EDWARD IV : Now princely Buckingham seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife's allies And make me happy in your unity <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate On you or yours but with all duteous love Doth cherish you and yours God punish me With hate in those where I expect most love <eos> When I have most need to employ a friend And most assured that he is a friend Deep hollow treacherous and full of guile Be he unto me <eos> this do I beg of God When I am cold in zeal to yours <eos> KING EDWARD IV : A pleasing cordial princely Buckingham is this thy vow unto my sickly heart <eos> There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here To make the perfect period of this peace <eos> BUCKINGHAM : And in good time here comes the noble duke <eos> GLOUCESTER : Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen : And princely peers a happy time of day <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Happy indeed as we have spent the day <eos> Brother we done deeds of charity Made peace enmity fair love of hate Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers <eos> GLOUCESTER : A blessed labour my most sovereign liege : Amongst this princely heap if any here By false intelligence or wrong surmise Hold me a foe If I unwittingly or in my rage Have aught committed that is hardly borne By any in this presence I desire To reconcile me to his friendly peace : 'Tis death to me to be at enmity I hate it and desire all good men's love <eos> First madam I entreat true peace of you Which I will purchase with my duteous service Of you my noble cousin Buckingham If ever any grudge were lodged between us Of you Lord Rivers and Lord Grey of you That without desert have frown'd on me Dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all <eos> I do not know that Englishman alive With whom my soul is any jot at odds More than the infant that is born to-night I thank my God for my humility <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : A holy day shall this be kept hereafter : I would to God all strifes were well compounded <eos> My sovereign liege I do beseech your majesty To take our brother Clarence to your grace <eos> GLOUCESTER : Why madam have I offer'd love for this To be so bouted in this royal presence <eos> Who knows not that the noble duke is dead <eos> You do him injury to scorn his corse <eos> RIVERS : Who knows not he is dead <eos> who knows he is <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : All seeing heaven what a world is this <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest <eos> DORSET : Ay my good lord and no one in this presence But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Is Clarence dead <eos> the order was reversed <eos> GLOUCESTER : But he poor soul by your first order died And that a winged Mercury did bear : Some tardy cripple bore the countermand That came too lag to see him buried <eos> God grant that some less noble and less loyal Nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did And yet go current from suspicion <eos> DORSET : A boon my sovereign for my service done <eos> KING EDWARD IV : I pray thee peace : my soul is full of sorrow <eos> DORSET : I will not rise unless your highness grant <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st <eos> DORSET : The forfeit sovereign of my servant's life Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Have a tongue to doom my brother's death And shall the same give pardon to a slave <eos> My brother slew no man his fault was thought And yet his punishment was cruel death <eos> Who sued to me for him <eos> who in my rage Kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advised Who spake of brotherhood <eos> who spake of love <eos> Who told me how the poor soul did forsake The mighty Warwick and did fight for me <eos> Who told me in the field by Tewksbury When Oxford had me down he rescued me And said 'Dear brother live and be a king' <eos> Who told me when we both lay in the field Frozen almost to death how he did lap me Even in his own garments and gave himself All thin and naked to the numb cold night <eos> All this from my remembrance brutish wrath Sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you Had so much grace to put it in my mind <eos> But when your carters or your waiting-vassals Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced The precious image of our dear Redeemer You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon And I unjustly too must grant it you But for my brother not a man would speak Nor I ungracious speak unto myself For him poor soul <eos> The proudest of you all Have been beholding to him in his life Yet none of you would once plead for his life <eos> O God I fear thy justice will take hold On me and you and mine and yours for this <eos> Come Hastings help me to my closet <eos> Oh poor Clarence <eos> GLOUCESTER : This is the fruit of rashness <eos> Mark'd you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death <eos> O they did urge it still unto the king <eos> God will revenge it <eos> But come let us in To comfort Edward with our company <eos> BUCKINGHAM : We wait upon your grace <eos> Boy : Tell me good grandam is our father dead <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : No boy <eos> Boy : Why do you wring your hands and beat your breast And cry 'O Clarence my unhappy son <eos>' Girl : Why do you look on us and shake your head And call us wretches orphans castaways If that our noble father be alive <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : My pretty cousins you mistake me much I do lament the sickness of the king <eos> As loath to lose him not your father's death It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost <eos> Boy : Then grandam you conclude that he is dead <eos> The king my uncle is to blame for this : God will revenge it whom I will importune With daily prayers all to that effect <eos> Girl : And so will I <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Peace children peace <eos> the king doth love you well : Incapable and shallow innocents You cannot guess who caused your father's death <eos> Boy : Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester Told me the king provoked by the queen Devised impeachments to imprison him : And when my uncle told me so he wept And hugg'd me in his arm and kindly kiss'd my cheek Bade me rely on him as on my father And he would love me dearly as his child <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile <eos> He is my son yea and therein my shame Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit <eos> Boy : Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Ay boy <eos> Boy : I cannot think it <eos> Hark <eos> what noise is this <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep To chide my fortune and torment myself <eos> I'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : What means this scene of rude impatience <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : To make an act of tragic violence : Edward my lord your son our king is dead <eos> Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd <eos> Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone <eos> If you will live lament if die be brief That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's Or like obedient subjects follow him To his new kingdom of perpetual rest <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow As I had title in thy noble husband <eos> I have bewept a worthy husband's death And lived by looking on his images : But now two mirrors of his princely semblance Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death And I for comfort have but one false glass Which grieves me when I see my shame in him <eos> Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother And hast the comfort of thy children left thee : But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs Edward and Clarence <eos> O what cause have I Thine being but a moiety of my grief To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries <eos> Boy : Good aunt you wept not for our father's death How can we aid you with our kindred tears <eos> Girl : Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Give me no help in lamentation I am not barren to bring forth complaints All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes That I being govern'd by the watery moon May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world <eos> Oh for my husband for my dear lord Edward <eos> Children : Oh for our father for our dear lord Clarence <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : What stay had I but Edward <eos> and he's gone <eos> Children : What stay had we but Clarence <eos> and he's gone <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : What stays had I but they <eos> and they are gone <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Was never widow had so dear a loss <eos> Children : Were never orphans had so dear a loss <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Was never mother had so dear a loss <eos> Alas I am the mother of these moans <eos> Their woes are parcell'd mine are general <eos> She for an Edward weeps and so do I I for a Clarence weep so doth not she : These babes for Clarence weep and so do I I for an Edward weep so do not they : Alas you three on me threefold distress'd Pour all your tears <eos> I am your sorrow's nurse And I will pamper it with lamentations <eos> DORSET : Comfort dear mother : God is much displeased That you take with unthankfulness his doing : In common worldly things 'tis call'd ungrateful With dull unwilligness to repay a debt Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent Much more to be thus opposite with heaven For it requires the royal debt it lent you <eos> RIVERS : Madam bethink you like a careful mother Of the young prince your son : send straight for him Let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives : Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave And plant your joys in living Edward's throne <eos> GLOUCESTER : Madam have comfort : all of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star But none can cure their harms by wailing them <eos> Madam my mother I do cry you mercy I did not see your grace : humbly on my knee I crave your blessing <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : God bless thee and put meekness in thy mind Love charity obedience and true duty <eos> GLOUCESTER : BUCKINGHAM : You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this mutual heavy load of moan Now cheer each other in each other's love Though we have spent our harvest of this king We are to reap the harvest of his son <eos> The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts But lately splinter'd knit and join'd together Must gently be preserved cherish'd and kept : Me seemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd Hither to London to be crown'd our king <eos> RIVERS : Why with some little train my Lord of Buckingham <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Marry my lord lest by a multitude The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out Which would be so much the more dangerous By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd : Where every horse bears his commanding rein And may direct his course as please himself As well the fear of harm as harm apparent In my opinion ought to be prevented <eos> GLOUCESTER : I hope the king made peace with all of us And the compact is firm and true in me <eos> RIVERS : And so in me and so I think in all : Yet since it is but green it should be put To no apparent likelihood of breach Which haply by much company might be urged : Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince <eos> HASTINGS : And so say I <eos> GLOUCESTER : Then be it so and go we to determine Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow <eos> Madam and you my mother will you go To give your censures in this weighty business <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : With all our harts <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My lord whoever journeys to the Prince For God's sake let not us two be behind For by the way I'll sort occasion As index to the story we late talk'd of To part the queen's proud kindred from the king <eos> GLOUCESTER : My other self my counsel's consistory My oracle my prophet <eos> My dear cousin I like a child will go by thy direction <eos> Towards Ludlow then for we'll not stay behind <eos> First Citizen : Neighbour well met : whither away so fast <eos> Second Citizen : I promise you I scarcely know myself : Hear you the news abroad <eos> First Citizen : Ay that the king is dead <eos> Second Citizen : Bad news by'r lady seldom comes the better : I fear I fear 'twill prove a troublous world <eos> Third Citizen : Neighbours God speed <eos> First Citizen : Give you good morrow sir <eos> Third Citizen : Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death <eos> Second Citizen : Ay sir it is too true God help the while <eos> Third Citizen : Then masters look to see a troublous world <eos> First Citizen : No no by God's good grace his son shall reign <eos> Third Citizen : Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child <eos> Second Citizen : In him there is a hope of government That in his nonage council under him And in his full and ripen'd years himself No doubt shall then and till then govern well <eos> First Citizen : So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old <eos> Third Citizen : Stood the state so <eos> No no good friends God wot For then this land was famously enrich'd With politic grave counsel then the king Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace <eos> First Citizen : Why so hath this both by the father and mother <eos> Third Citizen : Better it were they all came by the father Or by the father there were none at all For emulation now who shall be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not <eos> O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester <eos> And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud : And were they to be ruled and not to rule This sickly land might solace as before <eos> First Citizen : Come come we fear the worst all shall be well <eos> Third Citizen : When clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks When great leaves fall the winter is at hand When the sun sets who doth not look for night <eos> Untimely storms make men expect a dearth <eos> All may be well but if God sort it so 'Tis more than we deserve or I expect <eos> Second Citizen : Truly the souls of men are full of dread : Ye cannot reason almost with a man That looks not heavily and full of fear <eos> Third Citizen : Before the times of change still is it so : By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust Ensuing dangers as by proof we see The waters swell before a boisterous storm <eos> But leave it all to God <eos> whither away <eos> Second Citizen : Marry we were sent for to the justices <eos> Third Citizen : And so was I : I'll bear you company <eos> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Last night I hear they lay at Northampton At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night : To-morrow or next day they will be here <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I long with all my heart to see the prince : I hope he is much grown since last I saw him <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : But I hear no they say my son of York Hath almost overta'en him in his growth <eos> YORK : Ay mother but I would not have it so <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Why my young cousin it is good to grow <eos> YORK : Grandam one night as we did sit at supper My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow More than my brother : 'Ay' quoth my uncle Gloucester 'Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace :' And since methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Good faith good faith the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee He was the wretched'st thing when he was young So long a-growing and so leisurely That if this rule were true he should be gracious <eos> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Why madam so no doubt he is <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt <eos> YORK : Now by my troth if I had been remember'd I could have given my uncle's grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : How my pretty York <eos> I pray thee let me hear it <eos> YORK : Marry they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old 'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth <eos> Grandam this would have been a biting jest <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I pray thee pretty York who told thee this <eos> YORK : Grandam his nurse <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : His nurse <eos> why she was dead ere thou wert born <eos> YORK : If 'twere not she I cannot tell who told me <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : A parlous boy : go to you are too shrewd <eos> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Good madam be not angry with the child <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Pitchers have ears <eos> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Here comes a messenger <eos> What news <eos> Messenger : Such news my lord as grieves me to unfold <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : How fares the prince <eos> Messenger : Well madam and in health <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : What is thy news then <eos> Messenger : Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret With them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisoners <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Who hath committed them <eos> Messenger : The mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : For what offence <eos> Messenger : The sum of all I can I have disclosed Why or for what these nobles were committed Is all unknown to me my gracious lady <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Ay me I see the downfall of our house <eos> The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind Insulting tyranny begins to jet Upon the innocent and aweless throne : Welcome destruction death and massacre <eos> I see as in a map the end of all <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Accursed and unquiet wrangling days How many of you have mine eyes beheld <eos> My husband lost his life to get the crown And often up and down my sons were toss'd For me to joy and weep their gain and loss : And being seated and domestic broils Clean over-blown themselves the conquerors <eos> Make war upon themselves blood against blood Self against self : O preposterous And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen Or let me die to look on death no more <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Come come my boy we will to sanctuary <eos> Madam farewell <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I'll go along with you <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : You have no cause <eos> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : My gracious lady go And thither bear your treasure and your goods <eos> For my part I'll resign unto your grace The seal I keep : and so betide to me As well I tender you and all of yours <eos> Come I'll conduct you to the sanctuary <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Welcome sweet prince to London to your chamber <eos> GLOUCESTER : Welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign The weary way hath made you melancholy <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : No uncle but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy I want more uncles here to welcome me <eos> GLOUCESTER : Sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show which God he knows Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart <eos> Those uncles which you want were dangerous Your grace attended to their sugar'd words But look'd not on the poison of their hearts : God keep you from them and from such false friends <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : God keep me from false friends <eos> but they were none <eos> GLOUCESTER : My lord the mayor of London comes to greet you <eos> Lord Mayor : God bless your grace with health and happy days <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : I thank you good my lord and thank you all <eos> I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no <eos> BUCKINGHAM : And in good time here comes the sweating lord <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Welcome my lord : what will our mother come <eos> HASTINGS : On what occasion God he knows not I The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary : the tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your grace But by his mother was perforce withheld <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Fie what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers <eos> Lord cardinal will your grace Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York Unto his princely brother presently <eos> If she deny Lord Hastings go with him And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce <eos> CARDINAL : My Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory Can from his mother win the Duke of York Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessed sanctuary <eos> not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin <eos> BUCKINGHAM : You are too senseless <eos>obstinate my lord Too ceremonious and traditional Weigh it but with the grossness of this age You break not sanctuary in seizing him <eos> The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserved the place And those who have the wit to claim the place : This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it : Then taking him from thence that is not there You break no privilege nor charter there <eos> Oft have I heard of sanctuary men But sanctuary children ne'er till now <eos> CARDINAL : My lord you shall o'er-rule my mind for once <eos> Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me <eos> HASTINGS : I go my lord <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Good lords make all the speedy haste you may <eos> Say uncle Gloucester if our brother come Where shall we sojourn till our coronation <eos> GLOUCESTER : Where it seems best unto your royal self <eos> If I may counsel you some day or two Your highness shall repose you at the Tower : Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreation <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : I do not like the Tower of any place <eos> Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord <eos> BUCKINGHAM : He did my gracious lord begin that place Which since succeeding ages have re-edified <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Is it upon record or else reported Successively from age to age he built it <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Upon record my gracious lord <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : But say my lord it were not register'd Methinks the truth should live from age to age As 'twere retail'd to all posterity Even to the general all-ending day <eos> GLOUCESTER : PRINCE EDWARD : What say you uncle <eos> GLOUCESTER : I say without characters fame lives long <eos> Thus like the formal vice Iniquity I moralize two meanings in one word <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : That Julius Caesar was a famous man With what his valour did enrich his wit His wit set down to make his valour live Death makes no conquest of this conqueror For now he lives in fame though not in life <eos> I'll tell you what my cousin Buckingham <eos> BUCKINGHAM : What my gracious lord <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : An if I live until I be a man I'll win our ancient right in France again Or die a soldier as I lived a king <eos> GLOUCESTER : BUCKINGHAM : Now in good time here comes the Duke of York <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Richard of York <eos> how fares our loving brother <eos> YORK : Well my dread lord so must I call you now <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Ay brother to our grief as it is yours : Too late he died that might have kept that title Which by his death hath lost much majesty <eos> GLOUCESTER : How fares our cousin noble Lord of York <eos> YORK : I thank you gentle uncle <eos> O my lord You said that idle weeds are fast in growth The prince my brother hath outgrown me far <eos> GLOUCESTER : He hath my lord <eos> YORK : And therefore is he idle <eos> GLOUCESTER : O my fair cousin I must not say so <eos> YORK : Then is he more beholding to you than I <eos> GLOUCESTER : He may command me as my sovereign But you have power in me as in a kinsman <eos> YORK : I pray you uncle give me this dagger <eos> GLOUCESTER : My dagger little cousin <eos> with all my heart <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : A beggar brother <eos> YORK : Of my kind uncle that I know will give And being but a toy which is no grief to give <eos> GLOUCESTER : A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin <eos> YORK : A greater gift <eos> O that's the sword to it <eos> GLOUCESTER : A gentle cousin were it light enough <eos> YORK : O then I see you will part but with light gifts In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay <eos> GLOUCESTER : It is too heavy for your grace to wear <eos> YORK : I weigh it lightly were it heavier <eos> GLOUCESTER : What would you have my weapon little lord <eos> YORK : I would that I might thank you as you call me <eos> GLOUCESTER : How <eos> YORK : Little <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : My Lord of York will still be cross in talk : Uncle your grace knows how to bear with him <eos> YORK : You mean to bear me not to bear with me : Uncle my brother mocks both you and me Because that I am little like an ape He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders <eos> BUCKINGHAM : With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons <eos> To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle He prettily and aptly taunts himself : So cunning and so young is wonderful <eos> GLOUCESTER : My lord will't please you pass along <eos> Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you <eos> YORK : What will you go unto the Tower my lord <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : My lord protector needs will have it so <eos> YORK : I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower <eos> GLOUCESTER : Why what should you fear <eos> YORK : Marry my uncle Clarence' angry ghost : My grandam told me he was murdered there <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : I fear no uncles dead <eos> GLOUCESTER : Nor none that live I hope <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : An if they live I hope I need not fear <eos> But come my lord and with a heavy heart Thinking on them go I unto the Tower <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Think you my lord this little prating York Was not incensed by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously <eos> GLOUCESTER : No doubt no doubt O 'tis a parlous boy Bold quick ingenious forward capable He is all the mother's from the top to toe <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Well let them rest <eos> Come hither Catesby <eos> Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart : Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way What think'st thou <eos> is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind For the instalment of this noble duke In the seat royal of this famous isle <eos> CATESBY : He for his father's sake so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him <eos> BUCKINGHAM : What think'st thou then of Stanley <eos> what will he <eos> CATESBY : He will do all in all as Hastings doth <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Well then no more but this : go gentle Catesby And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings How doth he stand affected to our purpose And summon him to-morrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation <eos> If thou dost find him tractable to us Encourage him and show him all our reasons : If he be leaden icy-cold unwilling Be thou so too and so break off your talk And give us notice of his inclination : For we to-morrow hold divided councils Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd <eos> GLOUCESTER : Commend me to Lord William : tell him Catesby His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle And bid my friend for joy of this good news Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Good Catesby go effect this business soundly <eos> CATESBY : My good lords both with all the heed I may <eos> GLOUCESTER : Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep <eos> CATESBY : You shall my lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : At Crosby Place there shall you find us both <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Now my lord what shall we do if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots <eos> GLOUCESTER : Chop off his head man somewhat we will do : And look when I am king claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford and the moveables Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd <eos> BUCKINGHAM : I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands <eos> GLOUCESTER : And look to have it yielded with all willingness <eos> Come let us sup betimes that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form <eos> Messenger : What ho <eos> my lord <eos> HASTINGS : Messenger : A messenger from the Lord Stanley <eos> HASTINGS : What is't o'clock <eos> Messenger : Upon the stroke of four <eos> HASTINGS : Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights <eos> Messenger : So it should seem by that I have to say <eos> First he commends him to your noble lordship <eos> HASTINGS : And then <eos> Messenger : And then he sends you word He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm : Besides he says there are two councils held And that may be determined at the one which may make you and him to rue at the other <eos> Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure If presently you will take horse with him And with all speed post with him toward the north To shun the danger that his soul divines <eos> HASTINGS : Go fellow go return unto thy lord Bid him not fear the separated councils His honour and myself are at the one And at the other is my servant Catesby Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence <eos> Tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance : And for his dreams I wonder he is so fond To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase <eos> Go bid thy master rise and come to me And we will both together to the Tower Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly <eos> Messenger : My gracious lord I'll tell him what you say <eos> CATESBY : Many good morrows to my noble lord <eos> HASTINGS : Good morrow Catesby you are early stirring What news what news in this our tottering state <eos> CATESBY : It is a reeling world indeed my lord And I believe twill never stand upright Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm <eos> HASTINGS : How <eos> wear the garland <eos> dost thou mean the crown <eos> CATESBY : Ay my good lord <eos> HASTINGS : I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced <eos> But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it <eos> CATESBY : Ay on my life and hopes to find forward Upon his party for the gain thereof : And thereupon he sends you this good news That this same very day your enemies The kindred of the queen must die at Pomfret <eos> HASTINGS : Indeed I am no mourner for that news Because they have been still mine enemies : But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side To bar my master's heirs in true descent God knows I will not do it to the death <eos> CATESBY : God keep your lordship in that gracious mind <eos> HASTINGS : But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence That they who brought me in my master's hate I live to look upon their tragedy <eos> I tell thee Catesby <eos> CATESBY : What my lord <eos> HASTINGS : Ere a fortnight make me elder I'll send some packing that yet think not on it <eos> CATESBY : 'Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord When men are unprepared and look not for it <eos> HASTINGS : O monstrous monstrous <eos> and so falls it out With Rivers Vaughan Grey : and so 'twill do With some men else who think themselves as safe As thou and I who as thou know'st are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham <eos> CATESBY : The princes both make high account of you For they account his head upon the bridge <eos> HASTINGS : I know they do and I have well deserved it <eos> Come on come on where is your boar-spear man <eos> Fear you the boar and go so unprovided <eos> STANLEY : My lord good morrow good morrow Catesby : You may jest on but by the holy rood I do not like these several councils I <eos> HASTINGS : My lord I hold my life as dear as you do yours And never in my life I do protest Was it more precious to me than 'tis now : Think you but that I know our state secure I would be so triumphant as I am <eos> STANLEY : The lords at Pomfret when they rode from London Were jocund and supposed their state was sure And they indeed had no cause to mistrust But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast <eos> This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt : Pray God I say I prove a needless coward <eos> What shall we toward the Tower <eos> the day is spent <eos> HASTINGS : Come come have with you <eos> Wot you what my lord <eos> To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded <eos> LORD STANLEY : They for their truth might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats <eos> But come my lord let us away <eos> HASTINGS : Go on before I'll talk with this good fellow <eos> How now sirrah <eos> how goes the world with thee <eos> Pursuivant : The better that your lordship please to ask <eos> HASTINGS : I tell thee man 'tis better with me now Than when I met thee last where now we meet : Then was I going prisoner to the Tower By the suggestion of the queen's allies But now I tell thee <eos>keep it to thyself <eos> This day those enemies are put to death And I in better state than e'er I was <eos> Pursuivant : God hold it to your honour's good content <eos> HASTINGS : Gramercy fellow : there drink that for me <eos> Pursuivant : God save your lordship <eos> Priest : Well met my lord I am glad to see your honour <eos> HASTINGS : I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart <eos> I am in your debt for your last exercise Come the next Sabbath and I will content you <eos> BUCKINGHAM : What talking with a priest lord chamberlain <eos> Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest Your honour hath no shriving work in hand <eos> HASTINGS : Good faith and when I met this holy man Those men you talk of came into my mind <eos> What go you toward the Tower <eos> BUCKINGHAM : I do my lord but long I shall not stay I shall return before your lordship thence <eos> HASTINGS : 'Tis like enough for I stay dinner there <eos> BUCKINGHAM : HASTINGS : I'll wait upon your lordship <eos> RATCLIFF : Come bring forth the prisoners <eos> RIVERS : Sir Richard Ratcliff let me tell thee this : To-day shalt thou behold a subject die For truth for duty and for loyalty <eos> GREY : God keep the prince from all the pack of you <eos> A knot you are of damned blood-suckers <eos> VAUGHAN : You live that shall cry woe for this after <eos> RATCLIFF : Dispatch the limit of your lives is out <eos> RIVERS : O Pomfret Pomfret <eos> O thou bloody prison Fatal and ominous to noble peers <eos> Within the guilty closure of thy walls Richard the second here was hack'd to death And for more slander to thy dismal seat We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink <eos> GREY : Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son <eos> RIVERS : Then cursed she Hastings then cursed she Buckingham Then cursed she Richard <eos> O remember God To hear her prayers for them as now for us And for my sister and her princely sons Be satisfied dear God with our true blood Which as thou know'st unjustly must be spilt <eos> RATCLIFF : Make haste the hour of death is expiate <eos> RIVERS : Come Grey come Vaughan let us all embrace : And take our leave until we meet in heaven <eos> HASTINGS : My lords at once : the cause why we are met Is to determine of the coronation <eos> In God's name speak : when is the royal day <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Are all things fitting for that royal time <eos> DERBY : It is and wants but nomination <eos> BISHOP OF ELY : To-morrow then I judge a happy day <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Who knows the lord protector's mind herein <eos> Who is most inward with the royal duke <eos> BISHOP OF ELY : Your grace we think should soonest know his mind <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Who I my lord I we know each other's faces But for our hearts he knows no more of mine Than I of yours Nor I no more of his than you of mine <eos> Lord Hastings you and he are near in love <eos> HASTINGS : I thank his grace I know he loves me well But for his purpose in the coronation <eos> I have not sounded him nor he deliver'd His gracious pleasure any way therein : But you my noble lords may name the time And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice Which I presume he'll take in gentle part <eos> BISHOP OF ELY : Now in good time here comes the duke himself <eos> GLOUCESTER : My noble lords and cousins all good morrow <eos> I have been long a sleeper but I hope My absence doth neglect no great designs Which by my presence might have been concluded <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Had not you come upon your cue my lord William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part <eos> I mean your voice <eos>for crowning of the king <eos> GLOUCESTER : Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder His lordship knows me well and loves me well <eos> HASTINGS : I thank your grace <eos> GLOUCESTER : My lord of Ely <eos> BISHOP OF ELY : My lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : When I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there I do beseech you send for some of them <eos> BISHOP OF ELY : Marry and will my lord with all my heart <eos> GLOUCESTER : Cousin of Buckingham a word with you <eos> Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business And finds the testy gentleman so hot As he will lose his head ere give consent His master's son as worshipful as he terms it Shall lose the royalty of England's throne <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Withdraw you hence my lord I'll follow you <eos> DERBY : We have not yet set down this day of triumph <eos> To-morrow in mine opinion is too sudden For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be were the day prolong'd <eos> BISHOP OF ELY : Where is my lord protector <eos> I have sent for these strawberries <eos> HASTINGS : His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day There's some conceit or other likes him well When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit <eos> I think there's never a man in Christendom That can less hide his love or hate than he For by his face straight shall you know his heart <eos> DERBY : What of his heart perceive you in his face By any likelihood he show'd to-day <eos> HASTINGS : Marry that with no man here he is offended For were he he had shown it in his looks <eos> DERBY : I pray God he be not I say <eos> GLOUCESTER : I pray you all tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd Upon my body with their hellish charms <eos> HASTINGS : The tender love I bear your grace my lord Makes me most forward in this noble presence To doom the offenders whatsoever they be I say my lord they have deserved death <eos> GLOUCESTER : Then be your eyes the witness of this ill : See how I am bewitch'd behold mine arm Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up : And this is Edward's wife that monstrous witch Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore That by their witchcraft thus have marked me <eos> HASTINGS : If they have done this thing my gracious lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : If I thou protector of this damned strumpet <eos> Tellest thou me of 'ifs' <eos> Thou art a traitor : Off with his head <eos> Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same <eos> Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done : The rest that love me rise and follow me <eos> HASTINGS : Woe woe for England <eos> not a whit for me For I too fond might have prevented this <eos> Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm But I disdain'd it and did scorn to fly : Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble And startled when he look'd upon the Tower As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house <eos> O now I want the priest that spake to me : I now repent I told the pursuivant As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd And I myself secure in grace and favour <eos> O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head <eos> RATCLIFF : Dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner : Make a short shrift he longs to see your head <eos> HASTINGS : O momentary grace of mortal men Which we more hunt for than the grace of God <eos> Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep <eos> LOVEL : Come come dispatch 'tis bootless to exclaim <eos> HASTINGS : O bloody Richard <eos> miserable England <eos> I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee That ever wretched age hath look'd upon <eos> Come lead me to the block bear him my head <eos> They smile at me that shortly shall be dead <eos> GLOUCESTER : Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour Murder thy breath in the middle of a word And then begin again and stop again As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian Speak and look back and pry on every side Tremble and start at wagging of a straw Intending deep suspicion : ghastly looks Are at my service like enforced smiles And both are ready in their offices At any time to grace my stratagems <eos> But what is Catesby gone <eos> GLOUCESTER : He is and see he brings the mayor along <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Lord mayor <eos> GLOUCESTER : Look to the drawbridge there <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Hark <eos> a drum <eos> GLOUCESTER : Catesby o'erlook the walls <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Lord mayor the reason we have sent <eos> GLOUCESTER : Look back defend thee here are enemies <eos> BUCKINGHAM : God and our innocency defend and guard us <eos> GLOUCESTER : Be patient they are friends Ratcliff and Lovel <eos> LOVEL : Here is the head of that ignoble traitor The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings <eos> GLOUCESTER : So dear I loved the man that I must weep <eos> I took him for the plainest harmless creature That breathed upon this earth a Christian Made him my book wherein my soul recorded The history of all her secret thoughts : So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue That his apparent open guilt omitted I mean his conversation with Shore's wife He lived from all attainder of suspect <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor That ever lived <eos> Would you imagine or almost believe Were't not that by great preservation We live to tell it you the subtle traitor This day had plotted in the council-house To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester <eos> Lord Mayor : What had he so <eos> GLOUCESTER : What think You we are Turks or infidels <eos> Or that we would against the form of law Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death But that the extreme peril of the case The peace of England and our persons' safety Enforced us to this execution <eos> Lord Mayor : Now fair befall you <eos> he deserved his death And you my good lords both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts <eos> I never look'd for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore <eos> GLOUCESTER : Yet had not we determined he should die Until your lordship came to see his death Which now the loving haste of these our friends Somewhat against our meaning have prevented : Because my lord we would have had you heard The traitor speak and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treason That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens who haply may Misconstrue us in him and wail his death <eos> Lord Mayor : But my good lord your grace's word shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak And doubt you not right noble princes both But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this cause <eos> GLOUCESTER : And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here To avoid the carping censures of the world <eos> BUCKINGHAM : But since you come too late of our intents Yet witness what you hear we did intend : And so my good lord mayor we bid farewell <eos> GLOUCESTER : Go after after cousin Buckingham <eos> The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post : There at your meet'st advantage of the time Infer the bastardy of Edward's children : Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the crown meaning indeed his house Which by the sign thereof was termed so <eos> Moreover urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust Which stretched to their servants daughters wives Even where his lustful eye or savage heart Without control listed to make his prey <eos> Nay for a need thus far come near my person : Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that unsatiate Edward noble York My princely father then had wars in France And by just computation of the time Found that the issue was not his begot Which well appeared in his lineaments Being nothing like the noble duke my father : But touch this sparingly as 'twere far off Because you know my lord my mother lives <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Fear not my lord I'll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself : and so my lord adieu <eos> GLOUCESTER : If you thrive well bring them to Baynard's Castle Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops <eos> BUCKINGHAM : I go : and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords <eos> GLOUCESTER : Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw Go thou to Friar Penker bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle <eos> Now will I in to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight And to give notice that no manner of person At any time have recourse unto the princes <eos> Scrivener : This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd That it may be this day read over in Paul's <eos> And mark how well the sequel hangs together : Eleven hours I spent to write it over For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me The precedent was full as long a-doing : And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings Untainted unexamined free at liberty Here's a good world the while <eos> Why who's so gross That seeth not this palpable device <eos> Yet who's so blind but says he sees it not <eos> Bad is the world and all will come to nought When such bad dealings must be seen in thought <eos> GLOUCESTER : How now my lord what say the citizens <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Now by the holy mother of our Lord The citizens are mum and speak not a word <eos> GLOUCESTER : Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children <eos> BUCKINGHAM : I did with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France The insatiate greediness of his desires And his enforcement of the city wives His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy As being got your father then in France His resemblance being not like the duke Withal I did infer your lineaments Being the right idea of your father Both in your form and nobleness of mind Laid open all your victories in Scotland Your dicipline in war wisdom in peace Your bounty virtue fair humility : Indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse And when mine oratory grew to an end I bid them that did love their country's good Cry 'God save Richard England's royal king <eos>' GLOUCESTER : Ah <eos> and did they so <eos> BUCKINGHAM : No so God help me they spake not a word But like dumb statues or breathing stones Gazed each on other and look'd deadly pale <eos> Which when I saw I reprehended them And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence : His answer was the people were not wont To be spoke to but by the recorder <eos> Then he was urged to tell my tale again 'Thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd' But nothing spake in warrant from himself <eos> When he had done some followers of mine own At the lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard <eos>' And thus I took the vantage of those few 'Thanks gentle citizens and friends' quoth I 'This general applause and loving shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard :' And even here brake off and came away <eos> GLOUCESTER : What tongueless blocks were they <eos> would not they speak <eos> BUCKINGHAM : No by my troth my lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : Will not the mayor then and his brethren come <eos> BUCKINGHAM : The mayor is here at hand : intend some fear Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit : And look you get a prayer-book in your hand And stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord For on that ground I'll build a holy descant : And be not easily won to our request : Play the maid's part still answer nay and take it <eos> GLOUCESTER : I go and if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself No doubt well bring it to a happy issue <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks <eos> Welcome my lord I dance attendance here I think the duke will not be spoke withal <eos> Here comes his servant : how now Catesby What says he <eos> CATESBY : My lord : he doth entreat your grace To visit him to-morrow or next day : He is within with two right reverend fathers Divinely bent to meditation And no worldly suit would he be moved To draw him from his holy exercise <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Return good Catesby to thy lord again Tell him myself the mayor and citizens In deep designs and matters of great moment No less importing than our general good Are come to have some conference with his grace <eos> CATESBY : I'll tell him what you say my lord <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward <eos> He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed But on his knees at meditation Not dallying with a brace of courtezans But meditating with two deep divines Not sleeping to engross his idle body But praying to enrich his watchful soul : Happy were England would this gracious prince Take on himself the sovereignty thereof : But sure I fear we shall ne'er win him to it <eos> Lord Mayor : Marry God forbid his grace should say us nay <eos> BUCKINGHAM : I fear he will <eos> How now Catesby what says your lord <eos> CATESBY : My lord He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to speak with him His grace not being warn'd thereof before : My lord he fears you mean no good to him <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him : By heaven I come in perfect love to him And so once more return and tell his grace <eos> When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads 'tis hard to draw them thence So sweet is zealous contemplation <eos> Lord Mayor : See where he stands between two clergymen <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Two props of virtue for a Christian prince To stay him from the fall of vanity : And see a book of prayer in his hand True ornaments to know a holy man <eos> Famous Plantagenet most gracious prince Lend favourable ears to our request And pardon us the interruption Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal <eos> GLOUCESTER : My lord there needs no such apology : I rather do beseech you pardon me Who earnest in the service of my God Neglect the visitation of my friends <eos> But leaving this what is your grace's pleasure <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Even that I hope which pleaseth God above And all good men of this ungovern'd isle <eos> GLOUCESTER : I do suspect I have done some offence That seems disgracious in the city's eyes And that you come to reprehend my ignorance <eos> BUCKINGHAM : You have my lord : would it might please your grace At our entreaties to amend that fault <eos> GLOUCESTER : Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Then know it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat the throne majestical The scepter'd office of your ancestors Your state of fortune and your due of birth The lineal glory of your royal house To the corruption of a blemished stock : Whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts Which here we waken to our country's good This noble isle doth want her proper limbs Her face defaced with scars of infamy Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion <eos> Which to recure we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land Not as protector steward substitute Or lowly factor for another's gain But as successively from blood to blood Your right of birth your empery your own <eos> For this consorted with the citizens Your very worshipful and loving friends And by their vehement instigation In this just suit come I to move your grace <eos> GLOUCESTER : I know not whether to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof <eos> Best fitteth my degree or your condition If not to answer you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition not replying yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty Which fondly you would here impose on me If to reprove you for this suit of yours So season'd with your faithful love to me <eos> Then on the other side I cheque'd my friends <eos> Therefore to speak and to avoid the first And then in speaking not to incur the last Definitively thus I answer you <eos> Your love deserves my thanks but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request <eos> First if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As my ripe revenue and due by birth Yet so much is my poverty of spirit So mighty and so many my defects As I had rather hide me from my greatness Being a bark to brook no mighty sea Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapour of my glory smother'd <eos> But God be thank'd there's no need of me And much I need to help you if need were The royal tree hath left us royal fruit Which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time Will well become the seat of majesty And make no doubt us happy by his reign <eos> On him I lay what you would lay on me The right and fortune of his happy stars Which God defend that I should wring from him <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My lord this argues conscience in your grace But the respects thereof are nice and trivial All circumstances well considered <eos> You say that Edward is your brother's son : So say we too but not by Edward's wife For first he was contract to Lady Lucy <eos> Your mother lives a witness to that vow <eos> And afterward by substitute betroth'd To Bona sister to the King of France <eos> These both put by a poor petitioner A care-crazed mother of a many children A beauty-waning and distressed widow Even in the afternoon of her best days Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts To base declension and loathed bigamy By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward whom our manners term the prince <eos> More bitterly could I expostulate Save that for reverence to some alive I give a sparing limit to my tongue <eos> Then good my lord take to your royal self This proffer'd benefit of dignity If non to bless us and the land withal Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal true-derived course <eos> Lord Mayor : Do good my lord your citizens entreat you <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love <eos> CATESBY : O make them joyful grant their lawful suit <eos> GLOUCESTER : Alas why would you heap these cares on me <eos> I am unfit for state and majesty I do beseech you take it not amiss I cannot nor I will not yield to you <eos> BUCKINGHAM : If you refuse it <eos>as in love and zeal Loath to depose the child Your brother's son As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle kind effeminate remorse Which we have noted in you to your kin And egally indeed to all estates <eos> Yet whether you accept our suit or no Your brother's son shall never reign our king But we will plant some other in the throne To the disgrace and downfall of your house : And in this resolution here we leave you <eos> <eos> Come citizens : 'zounds <eos> I'll entreat no more <eos> GLOUCESTER : O do not swear my lord of Buckingham <eos> CATESBY : Call them again my lord and accept their suit <eos> ANOTHER : Do good my lord lest all the land do rue it <eos> GLOUCESTER : Would you enforce me to a world of care <eos> Well call them again <eos> I am not made of stone But penetrable to your <eos> kind entreats Albeit against my conscience and my soul <eos> Cousin of Buckingham and you sage grave men Since you will buckle fortune on my back To bear her burthen whether I will or no I must have patience to endure the load : But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach Attend the sequel of your imposition Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and stains thereof For God he knows and you may partly see How far I am from the desire thereof <eos> Lord Mayor : God bless your grace <eos> we see it and will say it <eos> GLOUCESTER : In saying so you shall but say the truth <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Then I salute you with this kingly title : Long live Richard England's royal king <eos> Lord Mayor : Amen <eos> BUCKINGHAM : To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd <eos> GLOUCESTER : Even when you please since you will have it so <eos> BUCKINGHAM : To-morrow then we will attend your grace : And so most joyfully we take our leave <eos> GLOUCESTER : Come let us to our holy task again <eos> Farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Who meets us here <eos> my niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester <eos> Now for my life she's wandering to the Tower On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes <eos> Daughter well met <eos> LADY ANNE : God give your graces both A happy and a joyful time of day <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : As much to you good sister <eos> Whither away <eos> LADY ANNE : No farther than the Tower and as I guess Upon the like devotion as yourselves To gratulate the gentle princes there <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Kind sister thanks : we'll enter all together <eos> And in good time here the lieutenant comes <eos> Master lieutenant pray you by your leave How doth the prince and my young son of York <eos> BRAKENBURY : Right well dear madam <eos> By your patience I may not suffer you to visit them The king hath straitly charged the contrary <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : The king <eos> why who's that <eos> BRAKENBURY : I cry you mercy : I mean the lord protector <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : The Lord protect him from that kingly title <eos> Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me <eos> I am their mother who should keep me from them <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I am their fathers mother I will see them <eos> LADY ANNE : Their aunt I am in law in love their mother : Then bring me to their sights I'll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee on my peril <eos> BRAKENBURY : No madam no I may not leave it so : I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me <eos> LORD STANLEY : Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence And I'll salute your grace of York as mother And reverend looker on of two fair queens <eos> Come madam you must straight to Westminster There to be crowned Richard's royal queen <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : O cut my lace in sunder that my pent heart May have some scope to beat or else I swoon With this dead-killing news <eos> LADY ANNE : Despiteful tidings <eos> O unpleasing news <eos> DORSET : Be of good cheer : mother how fares your grace <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : O Dorset speak not to me get thee hence <eos> Death and destruction dog thee at the heels Thy mother's name is ominous to children <eos> If thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas And live with Richmond from the reach of hell Go hie thee hie thee from this slaughter-house Lest thou increase the number of the dead And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse Nor mother wife nor England's counted queen <eos> LORD STANLEY : Full of wise care is this your counsel madam <eos> Take all the swift advantage of the hours You shall have letters from me to my son To meet you on the way and welcome you <eos> Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : O ill-dispersing wind of misery <eos> O my accursed womb the bed of death <eos> A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world Whose unavoided eye is murderous <eos> LORD STANLEY : Come madam come I in all haste was sent <eos> LADY ANNE : And I in all unwillingness will go <eos> I would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brain <eos> Anointed let me be with deadly venom And die ere men can say God save the queen <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Go go poor soul I envy not thy glory To feed my humour wish thyself no harm <eos> LADY ANNE : No <eos> why <eos> When he that is my husband now Came to me as I follow'd Henry's corse When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands Which issued from my other angel husband And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd O when I say I look'd on Richard's face This was my wish : 'Be thou' quoth I ' accursed For making me so young so old a widow <eos> And when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed And be thy wife <eos>if any be so mad <eos> As miserable by the life of thee As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death <eos> Lo ere I can repeat this curse again Even in so short a space my woman's heart Grossly grew captive to his honey words And proved the subject of my own soul's curse Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest For never yet one hour in his bed Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep But have been waked by his timorous dreams <eos> Besides he hates me for my father Warwick And will no doubt shortly be rid of me <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Poor heart adieu <eos> I pity thy complaining <eos> LADY ANNE : No more than from my soul I mourn for yours <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Farewell thou woful welcomer of glory <eos> LADY ANNE : Adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : QUEEN ELIZABETH : Stay yet look back with me unto the Tower <eos> Pity you ancient stones those tender babes Whom envy hath immured within your walls <eos> Rough cradle for such little pretty ones <eos> Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow For tender princes use my babies well <eos> So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell <eos> KING RICHARD III : Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My gracious sovereign <eos> KING RICHARD III : Give me thy hand <eos> Thus high by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated But shall we wear these honours for a day <eos> Or shall they last and we rejoice in them <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Still live they and for ever may they last <eos> KING RICHARD III : O Buckingham now do I play the touch To try if thou be current gold indeed Young Edward lives : think now what I would say <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Say on my loving lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Why Buckingham I say I would be king BUCKINGHAM : Why so you are my thrice renowned liege <eos> KING RICHARD III : Ha <eos> am I king <eos> 'tis so : but Edward lives <eos> BUCKINGHAM : True noble prince <eos> KING RICHARD III : O bitter consequence That Edward still should live <eos> 'True noble prince <eos>' Cousin thou wert not wont to be so dull : Shall I be plain <eos> I wish the bastards dead And I would have it suddenly perform'd <eos> What sayest thou <eos> speak suddenly be brief <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Your grace may do your pleasure <eos> KING RICHARD III : Tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezeth : Say have I thy consent that they shall die <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Give me some breath some little pause my lord Before I positively herein : I will resolve your grace immediately <eos> CATESBY : KING RICHARD III : I will converse with iron-witted fools And unrespective boys : none are for me That look into me with considerate eyes : High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect <eos> Boy <eos> Page : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold Would tempt unto a close exploit of death <eos> Page : My lord I know a discontented gentleman Whose humble means match not his haughty mind : Gold were as good as twenty orators And will no doubt tempt him to any thing <eos> KING RICHARD III : What is his name <eos> Page : His name my lord is Tyrrel <eos> KING RICHARD III : I partly know the man : go call him hither <eos> The deep-revolving witty Buckingham No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel : Hath he so long held out with me untired And stops he now for breath <eos> How now <eos> what news with you <eos> STANLEY : My lord I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled To Richmond in those parts beyond the sea Where he abides <eos> KING RICHARD III : Catesby <eos> CATESBY : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Rumour it abroad That Anne my wife is sick and like to die : I will take order for her keeping close <eos> Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter : The boy is foolish and I fear not him <eos> Look how thou dream'st <eos> I say again give out That Anne my wife is sick and like to die : About it for it stands me much upon To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me <eos> I must be married to my brother's daughter Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass <eos> Murder her brothers and then marry her <eos> Uncertain way of gain <eos> But I am in So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin : Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye <eos> Is thy name Tyrrel <eos> TYRREL : James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject <eos> KING RICHARD III : Art thou indeed <eos> TYRREL : Prove me my gracious sovereign <eos> KING RICHARD III : Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine <eos> TYRREL : Ay my lord But I had rather kill two enemies <eos> KING RICHARD III : Why there thou hast it : two deep enemies Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers Are they that I would have thee deal upon : Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower <eos> TYRREL : Let me have open means to come to them And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them <eos> KING RICHARD III : Thou sing'st sweet music <eos> Hark come hither Tyrrel Go by this token : rise and lend thine ear : There is no more but so : say it is done And I will love thee and prefer thee too <eos> TYRREL : 'Tis done my gracious lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Shall we hear from thee Tyrrel ere we sleep <eos> TYRREL : Ye shall my Lord <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My Lord I have consider'd in my mind The late demand that you did sound me in <eos> KING RICHARD III : Well let that pass <eos> Dorset is fled to Richmond <eos> BUCKINGHAM : I hear that news my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Stanley he is your wife's son well look to it <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My lord I claim your gift my due by promise For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd The earldom of Hereford and the moveables The which you promised I should possess <eos> KING RICHARD III : Stanley look to your wife if she convey Letters to Richmond you shall answer it <eos> BUCKINGHAM : What says your highness to my just demand <eos> KING RICHARD III : As I remember Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king When Richmond was a little peevish boy <eos> A king perhaps perhaps <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me I being by that I should kill him <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My lord your promise for the earldom <eos> KING RICHARD III : Richmond <eos> When last I was at Exeter The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle And call'd it Rougemont : at which name I started Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond <eos> BUCKINGHAM : My Lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Ay what's o'clock <eos> BUCKINGHAM : I am thus bold to put your grace in mind Of what you promised me <eos> KING RICHARD III : Well but what's o'clock <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Upon the stroke of ten <eos> KING RICHARD III : Well let it strike <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Why let it strike <eos> KING RICHARD III : Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation <eos> I am not in the giving vein to-day <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Why then resolve me whether you will or no <eos> KING RICHARD III : Tut tut Thou troublest me am not in the vein <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Is it even so <eos> rewards he my true service With such deep contempt made I him king for this <eos> O let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock while my fearful head is on <eos> TYRREL : The tyrannous and bloody deed is done <eos> The most arch of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of <eos> Dighton and Forrest whom I did suborn To do this ruthless piece of butchery Although they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs Melting with tenderness and kind compassion Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories <eos> 'Lo thus' quoth Dighton 'lay those tender babes :' 'Thus thus' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another Within their innocent alabaster arms : Their lips were four red roses on a stalk Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other <eos> A book of prayers on their pillow lay Which once' quoth Forrest 'almost changed my mind But O <eos> the devil' <eos>there the villain stopp'd Whilst Dighton thus told on : 'We smothered The most replenished sweet work of nature That from the prime creation e'er she framed <eos>' Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse They could not speak and so I left them both To bring this tidings to the bloody king <eos> And here he comes <eos> All hail my sovereign liege <eos> KING RICHARD III : Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news <eos> TYRREL : If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness be happy then For it is done my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : But didst thou see them dead <eos> TYRREL : I did my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : And buried gentle Tyrrel <eos> TYRREL : The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them But how or in what place I do not know <eos> KING RICHARD III : Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper And thou shalt tell the process of their death <eos> Meantime but think how I may do thee good And be inheritor of thy desire <eos> Farewell till soon <eos> The son of Clarence have I pent up close His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night <eos> Now for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth my brother's daughter And by that knot looks proudly o'er the crown To her I go a jolly thriving wooer <eos> CATESBY : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Good news or bad that thou comest in so bluntly <eos> CATESBY : Bad news my lord : Ely is fled to Richmond And Buckingham back'd with the hardy Welshmen Is in the field and still his power increaseth <eos> KING RICHARD III : Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army <eos> Come I have heard that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary Then fiery expedition be my wing Jove's Mercury and herald for a king <eos> Come muster men : my counsel is my shield We must be brief when traitors brave the field <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : So now prosperity begins to mellow And drop into the rotten mouth of death <eos> Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd To watch the waning of mine adversaries <eos> A dire induction am I witness to And will to France hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter black and tragical <eos> Withdraw thee wretched Margaret : who comes here <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Ah my young princes <eos> ah my tender babes <eos> My unblown flowers new-appearing sweets <eos> If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fix'd in doom perpetual Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother's lamentation <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Hover about her say that right for right Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet <eos> Edward for Edward pays a dying debt <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf <eos> When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : When holy Harry died and my sweet son <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost Woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd Brief abstract and record of tedious days Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : O that thou wouldst as well afford a grave As thou canst yield a melancholy seat <eos> Then would I hide my bones not rest them here <eos> O who hath any cause to mourn but I <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : If ancient sorrow be most reverend Give mine the benefit of seniory And let my woes frown on the upper hand <eos> If sorrow can admit society Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine : I had an Edward till a Richard kill'd him I had a Harry till a Richard kill'd him : Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard kill'd him Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him DUCHESS OF YORK : I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him I had a Rutland too thou holp'st to kill him <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard kill'd him <eos> From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death : That dog that had his teeth before his eyes To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood That foul defacer of God's handiwork That excellent grand tyrant of the earth That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves <eos> O upright just and true-disposing God How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother's body And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : O Harry's wife triumph not in my woes <eos> God witness with me I have wept for thine <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Bear with me I am hungry for revenge And now I cloy me with beholding it <eos> Thy Edward he is dead that stabb'd my Edward : Thy other Edward dead to quit my Edward Young York he is but boot because both they Match not the high perfection of my loss : Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward And the beholders of this tragic play The adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves <eos> Richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither : but at hand at hand Ensues his piteous and unpitied end : Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray <eos> To have him suddenly convey'd away <eos> Cancel his bond of life dear God I prey That I may live to say The dog is dead <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : O thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider that foul bunch-back'd toad <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune I call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen The presentation of but what I was The flattering index of a direful pageant One heaved a-high to be hurl'd down below A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes A dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble A sign of dignity a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot A queen in jest only to fill the scene <eos> Where is thy husband now <eos> where be thy brothers <eos> Where are thy children <eos> wherein dost thou joy <eos> Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen' <eos> Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee <eos> Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee <eos> Decline all this and see what now thou art : For happy wife a most distressed widow For joyful mother one that wails the name For queen a very caitiff crown'd with care For one being sued to one that humbly sues For one that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me For one being fear'd of all now fearing one For one commanding all obey'd of none <eos> Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about And left thee but a very prey to time Having no more but thought of what thou wert To torture thee the more being what thou art <eos> Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow <eos> Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke From which even here I slip my weary neck And leave the burthen of it all on thee <eos> Farewell York's wife and queen of sad mischance : These English woes will make me smile in France <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : O thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile And teach me how to curse mine enemies <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days Compare dead happiness with living woe Think that thy babes were fairer than they were And he that slew them fouler than he is : Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse : Revolving this will teach thee how to curse <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : My words are dull O quicken them with thine <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Why should calamity be full of words <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Windy attorneys to their client woes Airy succeeders of intestate joys Poor breathing orators of miseries <eos> Let them have scope : though what they do impart Help not all yet do they ease the heart <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : If so then be not tongue-tied : go with me <eos> And in the breath of bitter words let's smother My damned son which thy two sweet sons smother'd <eos> I hear his drum : be copious in exclaims <eos> KING RICHARD III : Who intercepts my expedition <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : O she that might have intercepted thee By strangling thee in her accursed womb From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be graven if that right were right The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my two sons and brothers <eos> Tell me thou villain slave where are my children <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Thou toad thou toad where is thy brother Clarence <eos> And little Ned Plantagenet his son <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Where is kind Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey <eos> KING RICHARD III : A flourish trumpets <eos> strike alarum drums <eos> Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women Rail on the Lord's enointed : strike I say <eos> Either be patient and entreat me fair Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Art thou my son <eos> KING RICHARD III : Ay I thank God my father and yourself <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Then patiently hear my impatience <eos> KING RICHARD III : Madam I have a touch of your condition Which cannot brook the accent of reproof <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : O let me speak <eos> KING RICHARD III : Do then : but I'll not hear <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I will be mild and gentle in my speech <eos> KING RICHARD III : And brief good mother for I am in haste <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Art thou so hasty <eos> I have stay'd for thee God knows in anguish pain and agony <eos> KING RICHARD III : And came I not at last to comfort you <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : No by the holy rood thou know'st it well Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell <eos> A grievous burthen was thy birth to me Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy Thy school-days frightful desperate wild and furious Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous Thy age confirm'd proud subdued bloody treacherous More mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred : What comfortable hour canst thou name That ever graced me in thy company <eos> KING RICHARD III : Faith none but Humphrey Hour that call'd your grace To breakfast once forth of my company <eos> If I be so disgracious in your sight Let me march on and not offend your grace <eos> Strike the drum <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I prithee hear me speak <eos> KING RICHARD III : You speak too bitterly <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Hear me a word For I shall never speak to thee again <eos> KING RICHARD III : So <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish And never look upon thy face again <eos> Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st <eos> My prayers on the adverse party fight And there the little souls of Edward's children Whisper the spirits of thine enemies And promise them success and victory <eos> Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me I say amen to all <eos> KING RICHARD III : Stay madam I must speak a word with you <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to murder : for my daughters Richard They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens And therefore level not to hit their lives <eos> KING RICHARD III : You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth Virtuous and fair royal and gracious <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : And must she die for this <eos> O let her live And I'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty Slander myself as false to Edward's bed Throw over her the veil of infamy : So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter I will confess she was not Edward's daughter <eos> KING RICHARD III : Wrong not her birth she is of royal blood <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : To save her life I'll say she is not so <eos> KING RICHARD III : Her life is only safest in her birth <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : And only in that safety died her brothers <eos> KING RICHARD III : Lo at their births good stars were opposite <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : No to their lives bad friends were contrary <eos> KING RICHARD III : All unavoided is the doom of destiny <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : True when avoided grace makes destiny : My babes were destined to a fairer death If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life <eos> KING RICHARD III : You speak as if that I had slain my cousins <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen'd Of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life <eos> Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts Thy head all indirectly gave direction : No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart To revel in the entrails of my lambs <eos> But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes And I in such a desperate bay of death Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom <eos> KING RICHARD III : Madam so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : What good is cover'd with the face of heaven To be discover'd that can do me good <eos> KING RICHARD III : The advancement of your children gentle lady <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Up to some scaffold there to lose their heads <eos> KING RICHARD III : No to the dignity and height of honour The high imperial type of this earth's glory <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Flatter my sorrows with report of it Tell me what state what dignity what honour Canst thou demise to any child of mine <eos> KING RICHARD III : Even all I have yea and myself and all Will I withal endow a child of thine So in the Lethe of thy angry soul Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs Which thou supposest I have done to thee <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Be brief lest that be process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness' date <eos> KING RICHARD III : Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul <eos> KING RICHARD III : What do you think <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul : So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it <eos> KING RICHARD III : Be not so hasty to confound my meaning : I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter And mean to make her queen of England <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Say then who dost thou mean shall be her king <eos> KING RICHARD III : Even he that makes her queen who should be else <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : What thou <eos> KING RICHARD III : I even I : what think you of it madam <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : How canst thou woo her <eos> KING RICHARD III : That would I learn of you As one that are best acquainted with her humour <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : And wilt thou learn of me <eos> KING RICHARD III : Madam with all my heart <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Send to her by the man that slew her brothers A pair of bleeding-hearts thereon engrave Edward and York then haply she will weep : Therefore present to her <eos>as sometime Margaret Did to thy father steep'd in Rutland's blood <eos> A handkerchief which say to her did drain The purple sap from her sweet brother's body And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith <eos> If this inducement force her not to love Send her a story of thy noble acts Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence Her uncle Rivers yea and for her sake Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne <eos> KING RICHARD III : Come come you mock me this is not the way To win our daughter <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : There is no other way Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard that hath done all this <eos> KING RICHARD III : Say that I did all this for love of her <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee Having bought love with such a bloody spoil <eos> KING RICHARD III : Look what is done cannot be now amended : Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes Which after hours give leisure to repent <eos> If I did take the kingdom from your sons To make amends Ill give it to your daughter <eos> If I have kill'd the issue of your womb To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter A grandam's name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother They are as children but one step below Even of your mettle of your very blood Of an one pain save for a night of groans Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow <eos> Your children were vexation to your youth But mine shall be a comfort to your age <eos> The loss you have is but a son being king And by that loss your daughter is made queen <eos> I cannot make you what amends I would Therefore accept such kindness as I can <eos> Dorset your son that with a fearful soul Leads discontented steps in foreign soil This fair alliance quickly shall call home To high promotions and great dignity : The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife <eos> Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother Again shall you be mother to a king And all the ruins of distressful times Repair'd with double riches of content <eos> What <eos> we have many goodly days to see : The liquid drops of tears that you have shed Shall come again transform'd to orient pearl Advantaging their loan with interest Of ten times double gain of happiness <eos> Go then my mother to thy daughter go Make bold her bashful years with your experience Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame Of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys And when this arm of mine hath chastised The petty rebel dull-brain'd Buckingham Bound with triumphant garlands will I come And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed To whom I will retail my conquest won And she shall be sole victress Caesar's Caesar <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : What were I best to say <eos> her father's brother Would be her lord <eos> or shall I say her uncle <eos> Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles <eos> Under what title shall I woo for thee That God the law my honour and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years <eos> KING RICHARD III : Infer fair England's peace by this alliance <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Which she shall purchase with still lasting war <eos> KING RICHARD III : Say that the king which may command entreats <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : That at her hands which the king's King forbids <eos> KING RICHARD III : Say she shall be a high and mighty queen <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : To wail the tide as her mother doth <eos> KING RICHARD III : Say I will love her everlastingly <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : But how long shall that title 'ever' last <eos> KING RICHARD III : Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last <eos> KING RICHARD III : So long as heaven and nature lengthens it <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : So long as hell and Richard likes of it <eos> KING RICHARD III : Say I her sovereign am her subject love <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : But she your subject loathes such sovereignty <eos> KING RICHARD III : Be eloquent in my behalf to her <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : An honest tale speeds best being plainly told <eos> KING RICHARD III : Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Plain and not honest is too harsh a style <eos> KING RICHARD III : Your reasons are too shallow and too quick <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : O no my reasons are too deep and dead Too deep and dead poor infants in their grave <eos> KING RICHARD III : Harp not on that string madam that is past <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break <eos> KING RICHARD III : Now by my George my garter and my crown <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Profaned dishonour'd and the third usurp'd <eos> KING RICHARD III : I swear <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : By nothing for this is no oath : The George profaned hath lost his holy honour The garter blemish'd pawn'd his knightly virtue The crown usurp'd disgraced his kingly glory <eos> if something thou wilt swear to be believed Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd <eos> KING RICHARD III : Now by the world <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs <eos> KING RICHARD III : My father's death <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Thy life hath that dishonour'd <eos> KING RICHARD III : Then by myself <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Thyself thyself misusest <eos> KING RICHARD III : Why then by God <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : God's wrong is most of all <eos> If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him The unity the king thy brother made Had not been broken nor my brother slain : If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him The imperial metal circling now thy brow Had graced the tender temples of my child And both the princes had been breathing here Which now two tender playfellows to dust Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms <eos> What canst thou swear by now <eos> KING RICHARD III : The time to come <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast For I myself have many tears to wash Hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee <eos> The children live whose parents thou hast slaughter'd Ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age The parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd Old wither'd plants to wail it with their age <eos> Swear not by time to come for that thou hast Misused ere used by time misused o'erpast <eos> KING RICHARD III : As I intend to prosper and repent So thrive I in my dangerous attempt Of hostile arms <eos> myself myself confound <eos> Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours <eos> Day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest <eos> Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if with pure heart's love Immaculate devotion holy thoughts I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter <eos> In her consists my happiness and thine Without her follows to this land and me To thee herself and many a Christian soul Death desolation ruin and decay : It cannot be avoided but by this It will not be avoided but by this <eos> Therefore good mother <eos>I must can you so <eos> Be the attorney of my love to her : Plead what I will be not what I have been Not my deserts but what I will deserve : Urge the necessity and state of times And be not peevish-fond in great designs <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Shall I be tempted of the devil thus <eos> KING RICHARD III : Ay if the devil tempt thee to do good <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Shall I forget myself to be myself <eos> KING RICHARD III : Ay if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : But thou didst kill my children <eos> KING RICHARD III : But in your daughter's womb I bury them : Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed Selves of themselves to your recomforture <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Shall I go win my daughter to thy will <eos> KING RICHARD III : And be a happy mother by the deed <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : I go <eos> Write to me very shortly <eos> And you shall understand from me her mind <eos> KING RICHARD III : Bear her my true love's kiss and so farewell <eos> Relenting fool and shallow changing woman <eos> How now <eos> what news <eos> RATCLIFF : My gracious sovereign on the western coast Rideth a puissant navy to the shore Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends Unarm'd and unresolved to beat them back : 'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral And there they hull expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore <eos> KING RICHARD III : Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk : Ratcliff thyself or Catesby where is he <eos> CATESBY : Here my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Fly to the duke : Post thou to Salisbury When thou comest thither <eos> Dull unmindful villain Why stand'st thou still and go'st not to the duke <eos> CATESBY : First mighty sovereign let me know your mind What from your grace I shall deliver to him <eos> KING RICHARD III : O true good Catesby : bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power he can make And meet me presently at Salisbury <eos> CATESBY : I go <eos> RATCLIFF : What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at Salisbury <eos> KING

what news with you <eos> STANLEY : None good my lord to please you with the hearing Nor none so bad but it may well be told <eos> KING RICHARD III : Hoyday a riddle <eos> neither good nor bad <eos> Why dost thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way <eos> Once more what news <eos> STANLEY : Richmond is on the seas <eos> KING RICHARD III : There let him sink and be the seas on him <eos> White-liver'd runagate what doth he there <eos> STANLEY : I know not mighty sovereign but by guess <eos> KING RICHARD III : Well sir as you guess as you guess <eos> STANLEY : Stirr'd up by Dorset Buckingham and Ely He makes for England there to claim the crown <eos> KING RICHARD III : Is the chair empty <eos> is the sword unsway'd <eos> Is the king dead <eos> the empire unpossess'd <eos> What heir of York is there alive but we <eos> And who is England's king but great York's heir <eos> Then tell me what doth he upon the sea <eos> STANLEY : Unless for that my liege I cannot guess <eos> KING RICHARD III : Unless for that he comes to be your liege You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes <eos> Thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear <eos> STANLEY : No mighty liege therefore mistrust me not <eos> KING RICHARD III : Where is thy power then to beat him back <eos> Where are thy tenants and thy followers <eos> Are they not now upon the western shore <eos> Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships <eos> STANLEY : No my good lord my friends are in the north <eos> KING RICHARD III : Cold friends to Richard : what do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west <eos> STANLEY : They have not been commanded mighty sovereign : Please it your majesty to give me leave I'll muster up my friends and meet your grace Where and what time your majesty shall please <eos> KING RICHARD III : Ay ay <eos> thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond : I will not trust you sir <eos> STANLEY : Most mighty sovereign You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful : I never was nor never will be false <eos> KING RICHARD III : Well Go muster men but hear you leave behind Your son George Stanley : look your faith be firm <eos> Or else his head's assurance is but frail <eos> STANLEY : So deal with him as I prove true to you <eos> Messenger : My gracious sovereign now in Devonshire As I by friends am well advertised Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate Bishop of Exeter his brother there With many more confederates are in arms <eos> Second Messenger : My liege in Kent the Guildfords are in arms And every hour more competitors Flock to their aid and still their power increaseth <eos> Third Messenger : My lord the army of the Duke of Buckingham <eos> KING RICHARD III : Out on you owls <eos> nothing but songs of death <eos> Take that until thou bring me better news <eos> Third Messenger : The news I have to tell your majesty Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd And he himself wander'd away alone No man knows whither <eos> KING RICHARD III : I cry thee mercy : There is my purse to cure that blow of thine <eos> Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd Reward to him that brings the traitor in <eos> Third Messenger : Such proclamation hath been made my liege <eos> Fourth Messenger : Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset 'Tis said my liege in Yorkshire are in arms <eos> Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest : Richmond in Yorkshire sent out a boat Unto the shore to ask those on the banks If they were his assistants yea or no Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham <eos> Upon his party : he mistrusting them Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany <eos> KING RICHARD III : March on march on since we are up in arms If not to fight with foreign enemies Yet to beat down these rebels here at home <eos> CATESBY : My liege the Duke of Buckingham is taken That is the best news : that the Earl of Richmond Is with a mighty power landed at Milford Is colder tidings yet they must be told <eos> KING RICHARD III : Away towards Salisbury <eos> while we reason here A royal battle might be won and lost Some one take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury the rest march on with me <eos> DERBY : Sir Christopher tell Richmond this from me : That in the sty of this most bloody boar My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold : If I revolt off goes young George's head The fear of that withholds my present aid <eos> But tell me where is princely Richmond now <eos> CHRISTOPHER : At Pembroke or at Harford-west in Wales <eos> DERBY : What men of name resort to him <eos> CHRISTOPHER : Sir Walter Herbert a renowned soldier Sir Gilbert Talbot Sir William Stanley Oxford redoubted Pembroke Sir James Blunt And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew And many more of noble fame and worth : And towards London they do bend their course If by the way they be not fought withal <eos> DERBY : Return unto thy lord commend me to him : Tell him the queen hath heartily consented He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter <eos> These letters will resolve him of my mind <eos> Farewell <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Will not King Richard let me speak with him <eos> Sheriff : No my good lord therefore be patient <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Hastings and Edward's children Rivers Grey Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward Vaughan and all that have miscarried By underhand corrupted foul injustice If that your moody discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour Even for revenge mock my destruction <eos> This is All-Souls' day fellows is it not <eos> Sheriff : It is my lord <eos> BUCKINGHAM : Why then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday <eos> This is the day that in King Edward's time I wish't might fall on me when I was found False to his children or his wife's allies This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall By the false faith of him I trusted most This this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs : That high All-Seer that I dallied with Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest <eos> Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms : Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head 'When he' quoth she 'shall split thy heart with sorrow Remember Margaret was a prophetess <eos>' Come sirs convey me to the block of shame Wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame <eos> RICHMOND : Fellows in arms and my most loving friends Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny Thus far into the bowels of the land Have we march'd on without impediment And here receive we from our father Stanley Lines of fair comfort and encouragement <eos> The wretched bloody and usurping boar That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough In your embowell'd bosoms this foul swine Lies now even in the centre of this isle Near to the town of Leicester as we learn From Tamworth thither is but one day's march <eos> In God's name cheerly on courageous friends To reap the harvest of perpetual peace By this one bloody trial of sharp war <eos> OXFORD : Every man's conscience is a thousand swords To fight against that bloody homicide <eos> HERBERT : I doubt not but his friends will fly to us <eos> BLUNT : He hath no friends but who are friends for fear <eos> Which in his greatest need will shrink from him <eos> RICHMOND : All for our vantage <eos> Then in God's name march : True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings : Kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings <eos> KING RICHARD III : Here pitch our tents even here in Bosworth field <eos> My Lord of Surrey why look you so sad <eos> SURREY : My heart is ten times lighter than my looks <eos> KING RICHARD III : My Lord of Norfolk <eos> NORFOLK : Here most gracious liege <eos> KING RICHARD III : Norfolk we must have knocks ha <eos> must we not <eos> NORFOLK : We must both give and take my gracious lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Up with my tent there <eos> here will I lie tonight But where to-morrow <eos> Well all's one for that <eos> Who hath descried the number of the foe <eos> NORFOLK : Six or seven thousand is their utmost power <eos> KING RICHARD III : Why our battalion trebles that account : Besides the king's name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse party want <eos> Up with my tent there <eos> Valiant gentlemen Let us survey the vantage of the field Call for some men of sound direction Let's want no discipline make no delay For lords to-morrow is a busy day <eos> RICHMOND : The weary sun hath made a golden set And by the bright track of his fiery car Gives signal of a goodly day to-morrow <eos> Sir William Brandon you shall bear my standard <eos> Give me some ink and paper in my tent I'll draw the form and model of our battle Limit each leader to his several charge And part in just proportion our small strength <eos> My Lord of Oxford you Sir William Brandon And you Sir Walter Herbert stay with me <eos> The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment : Good Captain Blunt bear my good night to him And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent : Yet one thing more good Blunt before thou go'st Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd dost thou know <eos> BLUNT : Unless I have mista'en his colours much Which well I am assured I have not done His regiment lies half a mile at least South from the mighty power of the king <eos> RICHMOND : If without peril it be possible Good Captain Blunt bear my good-night to him And give him from me this most needful scroll <eos> BLUNT : Upon my life my lord I'll under-take it And so God give you quiet rest to-night <eos> RICHMOND : Good night good Captain Blunt <eos> Come gentlemen Let us consult upon to-morrow's business In to our tent the air is raw and cold <eos> KING RICHARD III : What is't o'clock <eos> CATESBY : It's supper-time my lord It's nine o'clock <eos> KING RICHARD III : I will not sup to-night <eos> Give me some ink and paper <eos> What is my beaver easier than it was <eos> And all my armour laid into my tent <eos> CATESBY : If is my liege and all things are in readiness <eos> KING RICHARD III : Good Norfolk hie thee to thy charge Use careful watch choose trusty sentinels <eos> NORFOLK : I go my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Stir with the lark to-morrow gentle Norfolk <eos> NORFOLK : I warrant you my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Catesby <eos> CATESBY : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Send out a pursuivant at arms To Stanley's regiment bid him bring his power Before sunrising lest his son George fall Into the blind cave of eternal night <eos> Fill me a bowl of wine <eos> Give me a watch <eos> Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow <eos> Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy <eos> Ratcliff <eos> RATCLIFF : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland <eos> RATCLIFF : Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself Much about cock-shut time from troop to troop Went through the army cheering up the soldiers <eos> KING RICHARD III : So I am satisfied <eos> Give me a bowl of wine : I have not that alacrity of spirit Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have <eos> Set it down <eos> Is ink and paper ready <eos> RATCLIFF : It is my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Bid my guard watch leave me <eos> Ratcliff about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me <eos> Leave me I say <eos> DERBY : Fortune and victory sit on thy helm <eos> RICHMOND : All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person noble father-in-law <eos> Tell me how fares our loving mother <eos> DERBY : I by attorney bless thee from thy mother Who prays continually for Richmond's good : So much for that <eos> The silent hours steal on And flaky darkness breaks within the east <eos> In brief <eos>for so the season bids us be <eos> Prepare thy battle early in the morning And put thy fortune to the arbitrement Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war <eos> I as I may <eos>that which I would I cannot <eos> With best advantage will deceive the time And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms : But on thy side I may not be too forward Lest being seen thy brother tender George Be executed in his father's sight <eos> Farewell : the leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon : God give us leisure for these rites of love <eos> Once more adieu : be valiant and speed well <eos> RICHMOND : Good lords conduct him to his regiment : I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow When I should mount with wings of victory : Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen <eos> O Thou whose captain I account myself Look on my forces with a gracious eye Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath That they may crush down with a heavy fall The usurping helmets of our adversaries <eos> Make us thy ministers of chastisement That we may praise thee in the victory <eos> To thee I do commend my watchful soul Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes : Sleeping and waking O defend me still <eos> Ghost of Prince Edward : Ghost of King Henry VI : Ghost of CLARENCE : Ghost of RIVERS : Ghost of GREY : Ghost of VAUGHAN : All : Ghost of HASTINGS : Ghosts of young Princes : Ghost of LADY ANNE : Ghost of BUCKINGHAM : KING RICHARD III : Give me another horse : bind up my wounds <eos> Have mercy Jesu <eos> <eos>Soft <eos> I did but dream <eos> O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me <eos> The lights burn blue <eos> It is now dead midnight <eos> Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh <eos> What do I fear <eos> myself <eos> there's none else by : Richard loves Richard that is I am I <eos> Is there a murderer here <eos> No <eos> Yes I am : Then fly <eos> What from myself <eos> Great reason why : Lest I revenge <eos> What myself upon myself <eos> Alack <eos> I love myself <eos> Wherefore <eos> for any good That I myself have done unto myself <eos> O no <eos> alas I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself <eos> I am a villain : yet I lie <eos> I am not <eos> Fool of thyself speak well : fool do not flatter <eos> My conscience hath a thousand several tongues And every tongue brings in a several tale And every tale condemns me for a villain <eos> Perjury perjury in the high'st degree Murder stem murder in the direst degree All several sins all used in each degree Throng to the bar crying all Guilty <eos> guilty <eos> I shall despair <eos> There is no creature loves me And if I die no soul shall pity me : Nay wherefore should they since that I myself Find in myself no pity to myself <eos> Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd Came to my tent and every one did threat To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard <eos> RATCLIFF : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : 'Zounds <eos> who is there <eos> RATCLIFF : Ratcliff my lord 'tis I <eos> The early village-cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn Your friends are up and buckle on their armour <eos> KING RICHARD III : O Ratcliff I have dream'd a fearful dream <eos> What thinkest thou will our friends prove all true <eos> RATCLIFF : No doubt my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : O Ratcliff I fear I fear <eos> RATCLIFF : Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows <eos> KING RICHARD III : By the apostle Paul shadows to-night Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond <eos> It is not yet near day <eos> Come go with me Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper To see if any mean to shrink from me <eos> LORDS : Good morrow Richmond <eos> RICHMOND : Cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here <eos> LORDS : How have you slept my lord <eos> RICHMOND : The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams That ever enter'd in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had my lords <eos> Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd Came to my tent and cried on victory : I promise you my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream <eos> How far into the morning is it lords <eos> LORDS : Upon the stroke of four <eos> RICHMOND : Why then 'tis time to arm and give direction <eos> More than I have said loving countrymen The leisure and enforcement of the time Forbids to dwell upon : yet remember this God and our good cause fight upon our side The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls Like high-rear'd bulwarks stand before our faces Richard except those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow : For what is he they follow <eos> truly gentlemen A bloody tyrant and a homicide One raised in blood and one in blood establish'd One that made means to come by what he hath And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him Abase foul stone made precious by the foil Of England's chair where he is falsely set One that hath ever been God's enemy : Then if you fight against God's enemy God will in justice ward you as his soldiers If you do sweat to put a tyrant down You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain If you do fight against your country's foes Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire If you do fight in safeguard of your wives Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors If you do free your children from the sword Your children's children quit it in your age <eos> Then in the name of God and all these rights Advance your standards draw your willing swords <eos> For me the ransom of my bold attempt Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face But if I thrive the gain of my attempt The least of you shall share his part thereof <eos> Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully God and Saint George <eos> Richmond and victory <eos> KING RICHARD III : What said Northumberland as touching Richmond <eos> RATCLIFF : That he was never trained up in arms <eos> KING RICHARD III : He said the truth : and what said Surrey then <eos> RATCLIFF : He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose <eos>' KING RICHARD III : He was in the right and so indeed it is <eos> Ten the clock there <eos> Give me a calendar <eos> Who saw the sun to-day <eos> RATCLIFF : Not I my lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : Then he disdains to shine for by the book He should have braved the east an hour ago A black day will it be to somebody <eos> Ratcliff <eos> RATCLIFF : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD III : The sun will not be seen to-day The sky doth frown and lour upon our army <eos> I would these dewy tears were from the ground <eos> Not shine to-day <eos> Why what is that to me More than to Richmond <eos> for the selfsame heaven That frowns on me looks sadly upon him <eos> NORFOLK : Arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field <eos> KING RICHARD III : Come bustle bustle caparison my horse <eos> Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power : I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain And thus my battle shall be ordered : My foreward shall be drawn out all in length Consisting equally of horse and foot Our archers shall be placed in the midst John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey Shall have the leading of this foot and horse <eos> They thus directed we will follow In the main battle whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse <eos> This and Saint George to boot <eos> What think'st thou Norfolk <eos> NORFOLK : A good direction warlike sovereign <eos> This found I on my tent this morning <eos> KING RICHARD III : Messenger : My lord he doth deny to come <eos> KING RICHARD III : Off with his son George's head <eos> NORFOLK : My lord the enemy is past the marsh After the battle let George Stanley die <eos> KING RICHARD III : A thousand hearts are great within my bosom : Advance our standards set upon our foes Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons <eos> Upon them <eos> victory sits on our helms <eos> CATESBY : Rescue my Lord of Norfolk rescue rescue <eos> The king enacts more wonders than a man Daring an opposite to every danger : His horse is slain and all on foot he fights Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death <eos> Rescue fair lord or else the day is lost <eos> KING RICHARD III : A horse <eos> a horse <eos> my kingdom for a horse <eos> CATESBY : Withdraw my lord I'll help you to a horse <eos> KING RICHARD III : Slave I have set my life upon a cast And I will stand the hazard of the die : I think there be six Richmonds in the field Five have I slain to-day instead of him <eos> A horse <eos> a horse <eos> my kingdom for a horse <eos> RICHMOND : God and your arms be praised victorious friends The day is ours the bloody dog is dead <eos> DERBY : Courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee <eos> Lo here this long-usurped royalty From the dead temples of this bloody wretch Have I pluck'd off to grace thy brows withal : Wear it enjoy it and make much of it <eos> RICHMOND : Great God of heaven say Amen to all <eos> But tell me is young George Stanley living <eos> DERBY : He is my lord and safe in Leicester town Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us <eos> RICHMOND : What men of name are slain on either side <eos> DERBY : John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon <eos> RICHMOND : Inter their bodies as becomes their births : Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled That in submission will return to us : And then as we have ta'en the sacrament We will unite the white rose and the red : Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction That long have frown'd upon their enmity <eos> What traitor hears me and says not amen <eos> England hath long been mad and scarr'd herself The brother blindly shed the brother's blood The father rashly slaughter'd his own son The son compell'd been butcher to the sire : All this divided York and Lancaster Divided in their dire division O now let Richmond and Elizabeth The true succeeders of each royal house By God's fair ordinance conjoin together <eos> And let their heirs God if thy will be so <eos> Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days <eos> Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord That would reduce these bloody days again And make poor England weep in streams of blood <eos> Let them not live to taste this land's increase That would with treason wound this fair land's peace <eos> Now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again : That she may long live here God say amen <eos> KING RICHARD II : Old John of Gaunt time-honour'd Lancaster Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boisterous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : I have my liege <eos> KING RICHARD II : Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in him <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : As near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice <eos> KING RICHARD II : Then call them to our presence face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak : High-stomach'd are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Many years of happy days befal My gracious sovereign my most loving liege <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : Each day still better other's happiness Until the heavens envying earth's good hap Add an immortal title to your crown <eos> KING RICHARD II : We thank you both : yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason <eos> Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : First heaven be the record to my speech <eos> In the devotion of a subject's love Tendering the precious safety of my prince And free from other misbegotten hate Come I appellant to this princely presence <eos> Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven <eos> Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to be so and too bad to live Since the more fair and crystal is the sky The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly <eos> Once more the more to aggravate the note With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat And wish so please my sovereign ere I move What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal : 'Tis not the trial of a woman's war The bitter clamour of two eager tongues Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this : Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hush'd and nought at all to say : First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had return'd These terms of treason doubled down his throat <eos> Setting aside his high blood's royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain : Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Where ever Englishman durst set his foot <eos> Mean time let this defend my loyalty By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the king And lay aside my high blood's royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except <eos> If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop : By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : I take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder I'll answer thee in any fair degree Or chivalrous design of knightly trial : And when I mount alive may I not light If I be traitor or unjustly fight <eos> KING RICHARD II : What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge <eos> It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Look what I speak my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain <eos> Besides I say and will in battle prove Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was survey'd by English eye That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring <eos> Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death Suggest his soon-believing adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood : Which blood like sacrificing Abel's cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spent <eos> KING RICHARD II : How high a pitch his resolution soars <eos> Thomas of Norfolk what say'st thou to this <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : O let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men hate so foul a liar <eos> KING RICHARD II : Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears : Were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir As he is but my father's brother's son Now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul : He is our subject Mowbray so art thou : Free speech and fearless I to thee allow <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest <eos> Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers The other part reserved I by consent For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account Since last I went to France to fetch his queen : Now swallow down that lie <eos> For Gloucester's death I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case <eos> For you my noble Lord of Lancaster The honourable father to my foe Once did I lay an ambush for your life A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it and exactly begg'd Your grace's pardon and I hope I had it <eos> This is my fault : as for the rest appeall'd It issues from the rancour of a villain A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitor's foot To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom <eos> In haste whereof most heartily I pray Your highness to assign our trial day <eos> KING RICHARD II : Wrath-kindled gentlemen be ruled by me Let's purge this choler without letting blood : This we prescribe though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed <eos> Good uncle let this end where it begun We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : To be a make-peace shall become my age : Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolk's gage <eos> KING RICHARD II : And Norfolk throw down his <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : When Harry when <eos> Obedience bids I should not bid again <eos> KING RICHARD II : Norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot <eos> My life thou shalt command but not my shame : The one my duty owes but my fair name Despite of death that lives upon my grave To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have <eos> I am disgraced impeach'd and baffled here Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood Which breathed this poison <eos> KING RICHARD II : Rage must be withstood : Give me his gage : lions make leopards tame <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : Yea but not change his spots : take but my shame <eos> And I resign my gage <eos> My dear dear lord The purest treasure mortal times afford Is spotless reputation : that away Men are but gilded loam or painted clay <eos> A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast <eos> Mine honour is my life both grow in one : Take honour from me and my life is done : Then dear my liege mine honour let me try In that I live and for that will I die <eos> KING RICHARD II : Cousin throw up your gage do you begin <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : O God defend my soul from such deep sin <eos> Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight <eos> Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height Before this out-dared dastard <eos> Ere my tongue Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear The slavish motive of recanting fear And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbray's face <eos> KING RICHARD II : We were not born to sue but to command Which since we cannot do to make you friends Be ready as your lives shall answer it At Coventry upon Saint Lambert's day : There shall your swords and lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your settled hate : Since we can not atone you we shall see Justice design the victor's chivalry <eos> Lord marshal command our officers at arms Be ready to direct these home alarms <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Alas the part I had in Woodstock's blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims To stir against the butchers of his life <eos> But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven Who when they see the hours ripe on earth Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads <eos> DUCHESS : Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur <eos> Hath love in thy old blood no living fire <eos> Edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one Were as seven vials of his sacred blood Or seven fair branches springing from one root : Some of those seven are dried by nature's course Some of those branches by the Destinies cut But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester One vial full of Edward's sacred blood One flourishing branch of his most royal root Is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt Is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe <eos> Ah Gaunt his blood was thine <eos> that bed that womb That metal that self-mould that fashion'd thee Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest Yet art thou slain in him : thou dost consent In some large measure to thy father's death In that thou seest thy wretched brother die Who was the model of thy father's life <eos> Call it not patience Gaunt it is despair : In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee : That which in mean men we intitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts <eos> What shall I say <eos> to safeguard thine own life The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : God's is the quarrel for God's substitute His deputy anointed in His sight Hath caused his death : the which if wrongfully Let heaven revenge for I may never lift An angry arm against His minister <eos> DUCHESS : Where then alas may I complain myself <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : To God the widow's champion and defence <eos> DUCHESS : Why then I will <eos> Farewell old Gaunt <eos> Thou goest to Coventry there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight : O sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast <eos> Or if misfortune miss the first career Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom They may break his foaming courser's back And throw the rider headlong in the lists A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford <eos> Farewell old Gaunt : thy sometimes brother's wife With her companion grief must end her life <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Sister farewell I must to Coventry : As much good stay with thee as go with me <eos> DUCHESS : Yet one word more : grief boundeth where it falls Not with the empty hollowness but weight : I take my leave before I have begun For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done <eos> Commend me to thy brother Edmund York <eos> Lo this is all : <eos>nay yet depart not so Though this be all do not so quickly go I shall remember more <eos> Bid him <eos>ah what <eos> <eos> With all good speed at Plashy visit me <eos> Alack and what shall good old York there see But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls Unpeopled offices untrodden stones <eos> And what hear there for welcome but my groans <eos> Therefore commend me let him not come there To seek out sorrow that dwells every where <eos> Desolate desolate will I hence and die : The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye <eos> Lord Marshal : My Lord Aumerle is Harry Hereford arm'd <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Yea at all points and longs to enter in <eos> Lord Marshal : The Duke of Norfolk sprightfully and bold Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Why then the champions are prepared and stay For nothing but his majesty's approach <eos> KING RICHARD II : Marshal demand of yonder champion The cause of his arrival here in arms : Ask him his name and orderly proceed To swear him in the justice of his cause <eos> Lord Marshal : In God's name and the king's say who thou art And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms Against what man thou comest and what thy quarrel : Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath As so defend thee heaven and thy valour <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : My name is Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk Who hither come engaged by my oath <eos> Which God defend a knight should violate <eos> <eos> Both to defend my loyalty and truth To God my king and my succeeding issue Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me And by the grace of God and this mine arm To prove him in defending of myself A traitor to my God my king and me : And as I truly fight defend me heaven <eos> KING RICHARD II : Marshal ask yonder knight in arms Both who he is and why he cometh hither Thus plated in habiliments of war And formally according to our law Depose him in the justice of his cause <eos> Lord Marshal : What is thy name <eos> and wherefore comest thou hither Before King Richard in his royal lists <eos> Against whom comest thou <eos> and what's thy quarrel <eos> Speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby Am I who ready here do stand in arms To prove by God's grace and my body's valour In lists on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk That he is a traitor foul and dangerous To God of heaven King Richard and to me And as I truly fight defend me heaven <eos> Lord Marshal : On pain of death no person be so bold Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists Except the marshal and such officers Appointed to direct these fair designs <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign's hand And bow my knee before his majesty : For Mowbray and myself are like two men That vow a long and weary pilgrimage Then let us take a ceremonious leave And loving farewell of our several friends <eos> Lord Marshal : The appellant in all duty greets your highness And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave <eos> KING RICHARD II : We will descend and fold him in our arms <eos> Cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right So be thy fortune in this royal fight <eos> Farewell my blood which if to-day thou shed Lament we may but not revenge thee dead <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : O let no noble eye profane a tear For me if I be gored with Mowbray's spear : As confident as is the falcon's flight Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight <eos> My loving lord I take my leave of you Of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle Not sick although I have to do with death But lusty young and cheerly drawing breath <eos> Lo as at English feasts so I regreet The daintiest last to make the end most sweet : O thou the earthly author of my blood Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up To reach at victory above my head Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers And with thy blessings steel my lance's point That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt Even in the lusty havior of his son <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : God in thy good cause make thee prosperous <eos> Be swift like lightning in the execution And let thy blows doubly redoubled Fall like amazing thunder on the casque Of thy adverse pernicious enemy : Rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : However God or fortune cast my lot There lives or dies true to King Richard's throne A loyal just and upright gentleman : Never did captive with a freer heart Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement More than my dancing soul doth celebrate This feast of battle with mine adversary <eos> Most mighty liege and my companion peers Take from my mouth the wish of happy years : As gentle and as jocund as to jest Go I to fight : truth hath a quiet breast <eos> KING RICHARD II : Farewell my lord : securely I espy Virtue with valour couched in thine eye <eos> Order the trial marshal and begin <eos> Lord Marshal : Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby Receive thy lance and God defend the right <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Strong as a tower in hope I cry amen <eos> Lord Marshal : Go bear this lance to Thomas Duke of Norfolk <eos> First Herald : Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby Stands here for God his sovereign and himself On pain to be found false and recreant To prove the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray A traitor to his God his king and him And dares him to set forward to the fight <eos> Second Herald : Here standeth Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk On pain to be found false and recreant Both to defend himself and to approve Henry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby To God his sovereign and to him disloyal Courageously and with a free desire Attending but the signal to begin <eos> Lord Marshal : Sound trumpets and set forward combatants <eos> Stay the king hath thrown his warder down <eos> KING RICHARD II : Let them lay by their helmets and their spears And both return back to their chairs again : Withdraw with us : and let the trumpets sound While we return these dukes what we decree <eos> Draw near And list what with our council we have done <eos> For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd With that dear blood which it hath fostered And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword And for we think the eagle-winged pride Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts With rival-hating envy set on you To wake our peace which in our country's cradle Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray And grating shock of wrathful iron arms Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace And make us wade even in our kindred's blood Therefore we banish you our territories : You cousin Hereford upon pain of life Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields Shall not regreet our fair dominions But tread the stranger paths of banishment <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Your will be done : this must my comfort be Sun that warms you here shall shine on me And those his golden beams to you here lent Shall point on me and gild my banishment <eos> KING RICHARD II : Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom Which I with some unwillingness pronounce : The sly slow hours shall not determinate The dateless limit of thy dear exile The hopeless word of 'never to return' Breathe I against thee upon pain of life <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth : A dearer merit not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air Have I deserved at your highness' hands <eos> The language I have learn'd these forty years My native English now I must forego : And now my tongue's use is to me no more Than an unstringed viol or a harp Or like a cunning instrument cased up Or being open put into his hands That knows no touch to tune the harmony : Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips And dull unfeeling barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me <eos> I am too old to fawn upon a nurse Too far in years to be a pupil now : What is thy sentence then but speechless death Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath <eos> KING RICHARD II : It boots thee not to be compassionate : After our sentence plaining comes too late <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : Then thus I turn me from my country's light To dwell in solemn shades of endless night <eos> KING RICHARD II : Return again and take an oath with thee <eos> Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands Swear by the duty that you owe to God <eos> Our part therein we banish with yourselves <eos> To keep the oath that we administer : You never shall so help you truth and God <eos> Embrace each other's love in banishment Nor never look upon each other's face Nor never write regreet nor reconcile This louring tempest of your home-bred hate Nor never by advised purpose meet To plot contrive or complot any ill 'Gainst us our state our subjects or our land <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I swear <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : And I to keep all this <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Norfolk so far as to mine enemy : <eos> By this time had the king permitted us One of our souls had wander'd in the air <eos> Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh As now our flesh is banish'd from this land : Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm Since thou hast far to go bear not along The clogging burthen of a guilty soul <eos> THOMAS MOWBRAY : No Bolingbroke : if ever I were traitor My name be blotted from the book of life And I from heaven banish'd as from hence <eos> But what thou art God thou and I do know And all too soon I fear the king shall rue <eos> Farewell my liege <eos> Now no way can I stray Save back to England all the world's my way <eos> KING RICHARD II : Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes I see thy grieved heart : thy sad aspect Hath from the number of his banish'd years Pluck'd four away <eos> Six frozen winter spent Return with welcome home from banishment <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : How long a time lies in one little word <eos> Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word : such is the breath of kings <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : I thank my liege that in regard of me He shortens four years of my son's exile : But little vantage shall I reap thereby For ere the six years that he hath to spend Can change their moons and bring their times about My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light Shall be extinct with age and endless night My inch of taper will be burnt and done And blindfold death not let me see my son <eos> KING RICHARD II : Why uncle thou hast many years to live <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : But not a minute king that thou canst give : Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow Thou canst help time to furrow me with age But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage Thy word is current with him for my death But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath <eos> KING RICHARD II : Thy son is banish'd upon good advice Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave : Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour <eos> You urged me as a judge but I had rather You would have bid me argue like a father <eos> O had it been a stranger not my child To smooth his fault I should have been more mild : A partial slander sought I to avoid And in the sentence my own life destroy'd <eos> Alas I look'd when some of you should say I was too strict to make mine own away But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue Against my will to do myself this wrong <eos> KING RICHARD II : Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so : Six years we banish him and he shall go <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Cousin farewell : what presence must not know From where you do remain let paper show <eos> Lord Marshal : My lord no leave take I for I will ride As far as land will let me by your side <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I have too few to take my leave of you When the tongue's office should be prodigal To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Thy grief is but thy absence for a time <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Joy absent grief is present for that time <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : What is six winters <eos> they are quickly gone <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : My heart will sigh when I miscall it so Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : The sullen passage of thy weary steps Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set The precious jewel of thy home return <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Nay rather every tedious stride I make Will but remember me what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love <eos> Must I not serve a long apprenticehood To foreign passages and in the end Having my freedom boast of nothing else But that I was a journeyman to grief <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens <eos> Teach thy necessity to reason thus There is no virtue like necessity <eos> Think not the king did banish thee But thou the king <eos> Woe doth the heavier sit Where it perceives it is but faintly borne <eos> Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour And not the king exiled thee or suppose Devouring pestilence hangs in our air And thou art flying to a fresher clime : Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it To lie that way thou go'st not whence thou comest : Suppose the singing birds musicians The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more Than a delightful measure or a dance For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite The man that mocks at it and sets it light <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : O who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus <eos> Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast <eos> Or wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantastic summer's heat <eos> O no <eos> the apprehension of the good Gives but the greater feeling to the worse : Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Come come my son I'll bring thee on thy way : Had I thy youth and cause I would not stay <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Then England's ground farewell sweet soil adieu My mother and my nurse that bears me yet <eos> Where'er I wander boast of this I can Though banish'd yet a trueborn Englishman <eos> KING RICHARD II : We did observe <eos> Cousin Aumerle How far brought you high Hereford on his way <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : I brought high Hereford if you call him so But to the next highway and there I left him <eos> KING RICHARD II : And say what store of parting tears were shed <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Faith none for me except the north-east wind Which then blew bitterly against our faces Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance Did grace our hollow parting with a tear <eos> KING RICHARD II : What said our cousin when you parted with him <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : 'Farewell :' And for my heart disdained that my tongue Should so profane the word that taught me craft To counterfeit oppression of such grief That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave <eos> Marry would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours And added years to his short banishment He should have had a volume of farewells But since it would not he had none of me <eos> KING RICHARD II : He is our cousin cousin but 'tis doubt When time shall call him home from banishment Whether our kinsman come to see his friends <eos> Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green Observed his courtship to the common people How he did seem to dive into their hearts With humble and familiar courtesy What reverence he did throw away on slaves Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles And patient underbearing of his fortune As 'twere to banish their affects with him <eos> Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench A brace of draymen bid God speed him well And had the tribute of his supple knee With 'Thanks my countrymen my loving friends' As were our England in reversion his And he our subjects' next degree in hope <eos> GREEN : Well he is gone and with him go these thoughts <eos> Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland Expedient manage must be made my liege Ere further leisure yield them further means For their advantage and your highness' loss <eos> KING RICHARD II : We will ourself in person to this war : And for our coffers with too great a court And liberal largess are grown somewhat light We are inforced to farm our royal realm The revenue whereof shall furnish us For our affairs in hand : if that come short Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters Whereto when they shall know what men are rich They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold And send them after to supply our wants For we will make for Ireland presently <eos> Bushy what news <eos> BUSHY : Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord Suddenly taken and hath sent post haste To entreat your majesty to visit him <eos> KING RICHARD II : Where lies he <eos> BUSHY : At Ely House <eos> KING RICHARD II : Now put it God in the physician's mind To help him to his grave immediately <eos> The lining of his coffers shall make coats To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars <eos> Come gentlemen let's all go visit him : Pray God we may make haste and come too late <eos> All : Amen <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Will the king come that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath For all in vain comes counsel to his ear <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : O but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony : Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain <eos> He that no more must say is listen'd more Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before : The setting sun and music at the close As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last Writ in remembrance more than things long past : Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear <eos> DUKE OF YORK : No it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds As praises of whose taste the wise are fond Lascivious metres to whose venom sound The open ear of youth doth always listen Report of fashions in proud Italy Whose manners still our tardy apish nation Limps after in base imitation <eos> Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity <eos> So it be new there's no respect how vile <eos> That is not quickly buzzed into his ears <eos> Then all too late comes counsel to be heard Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard <eos> Direct not him whose way himself will choose : 'Tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Methinks I am a prophet new inspired And thus expiring do foretell of him : His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last For violent fires soon burn out themselves Small showers last long but sudden storms are short He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder : Light vanity insatiate cormorant Consuming means soon preys upon itself <eos> This royal throne of kings this scepter'd isle This earth of majesty this seat of Mars This other Eden demi-paradise This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war This happy breed of men this little world This precious stone set in the silver sea Which serves it in the office of a wall Or as a moat defensive to a house Against the envy of less happier lands This blessed plot this earth this realm this England This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth Renowned for their deeds as far from home For Christian service and true chivalry As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry Of the world's ransom blessed Mary's Son This land of such dear souls this dear dear land Dear for her reputation through the world Is now leased out I die pronouncing it Like to a tenement or pelting farm : England bound in with the triumphant sea Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege Of watery Neptune is now bound in with shame With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds : That England that was wont to conquer others Hath made a shameful conquest of itself <eos> Ah would the scandal vanish with my life How happy then were my ensuing death <eos> DUKE OF YORK : The king is come : deal mildly with his youth For young hot colts being raged do rage the more <eos> QUEEN : How fares our noble uncle Lancaster <eos> KING RICHARD II : What comfort man <eos> how is't with aged Gaunt <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : O how that name befits my composition <eos> Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old : Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt <eos> For sleeping England long time have I watch'd Watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt : The pleasure that some fathers feed upon Is my strict fast I mean my children's looks And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt : Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones <eos> KING RICHARD II : Can sick men play so nicely with their names <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : No misery makes sport to mock itself : Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me I mock my name great king to flatter thee <eos> KING RICHARD II : Should dying men flatter with those that live <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : No no men living flatter those that die <eos> KING RICHARD II : Thou now a-dying say'st thou flatterest me <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : O no <eos> thou diest though I the sicker be <eos> KING RICHARD II : I am in health I breathe and see thee ill <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : Now He that made me knows I see thee ill Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill <eos> Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land Wherein thou liest in reputation sick And thou too careless patient as thou art Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure Of those physicians that first wounded thee : A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown Whose compass is no bigger than thy head And yet incaged in so small a verge The waste is no whit lesser than thy land <eos> O had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd Which art possess'd now to depose thyself <eos> Why cousin wert thou regent of the world It were a shame to let this land by lease But for thy world enjoying but this land Is it not more than shame to shame it so <eos> Landlord of England art thou now not king : Thy state of law is bondslave to the law And thou <eos> KING RICHARD II : A lunatic lean-witted fool Presuming on an ague's privilege Darest with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood With fury from his native residence <eos> Now by my seat's right royal majesty Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders <eos> JOHN OF GAUNT : O spare me not my brother Edward's son For that I was his father Edward's son That blood already like the pelican Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused : My brother Gloucester plain well-meaning soul Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls <eos> May be a precedent and witness good That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood : Join with the present sickness that I have And thy unkindness be like crooked age To crop at once a too long wither'd flower <eos> Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee <eos> These words hereafter thy tormentors be <eos> Convey me to my bed then to my grave : Love they to live that love and honour have <eos> KING RICHARD II : And let them die that age and sullens have For both hast thou and both become the grave <eos> DUKE OF YORK : I do beseech your majesty impute his words To wayward sickliness and age in him : He loves you on my life and holds you dear As Harry Duke of Hereford were he here <eos> KING RICHARD II : Right you say true : as Hereford's love so his As theirs so mine and all be as it is <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : My liege old Gaunt commends him to your majesty <eos> KING RICHARD II : What says he <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Nay nothing all is said His tongue is now a stringless instrument Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Be York the next that must be bankrupt so <eos> Though death be poor it ends a mortal woe <eos> KING RICHARD II : The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he His time is spent our pilgrimage must be <eos> So much for that <eos> Now for our Irish wars : We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns Which live like venom where no venom else But only they have privilege to live <eos> And for these great affairs do ask some charge Towards our assistance we do seize to us The plate corn revenues and moveables Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd <eos> DUKE OF YORK : How long shall I be patient <eos> ah how long Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong <eos> Not Gloucester's death nor Hereford's banishment Not Gaunt's rebukes nor England's private wrongs Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke About his marriage nor my own disgrace Have ever made me sour my patient cheek Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face <eos> I am the last of noble Edward's sons Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first : In war was never lion raged more fierce In peace was never gentle lamb more mild Than was that young and princely gentleman <eos> His face thou hast for even so look'd he Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours But when he frown'd it was against the French And not against his friends his noble hand Did will what he did spend and spent not that Which his triumphant father's hand had won His hands were guilty of no kindred blood But bloody with the enemies of his kin <eos> O Richard <eos> York is too far gone with grief Or else he never would compare between <eos> KING RICHARD II : Why uncle what's the matter <eos> DUKE OF YORK : O my liege Pardon me if you please if not I pleased Not to be pardon'd am content withal <eos> Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford <eos> Is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live <eos> Was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true <eos> Did not the one deserve to have an heir <eos> Is not his heir a well-deserving son <eos> Take Hereford's rights away and take from Time His charters and his customary rights Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day Be not thyself for how art thou a king But by fair sequence and succession <eos> Now afore God <eos>God forbid I say true <eos> <eos> If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights Call in the letters patent that he hath By his attorneys-general to sue His livery and deny his offer'd homage You pluck a thousand dangers on your head You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts And prick my tender patience to those thoughts Which honour and allegiance cannot think <eos> KING RICHARD II : Think what you will we seize into our hands His plate his goods his money and his lands <eos> DUKE OF YORK : I'll not be by the while : my liege farewell : What will ensue hereof there's none can tell But by bad courses may be understood That their events can never fall out good <eos> KING RICHARD II : Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight : Bid him repair to us to Ely House To see this business <eos> To-morrow next We will for Ireland and 'tis time I trow : And we create in absence of ourself Our uncle York lord governor of England For he is just and always loved us well <eos> Come on our queen : to-morrow must we part Be merry for our time of stay is short NORTHUMBERLAND : Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead <eos> LORD ROSS : And living too for now his son is duke <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : Barely in title not in revenue <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Richly in both if justice had her right <eos> LORD ROSS : My heart is great but it must break with silence Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more That speaks thy words again to do thee harm <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford <eos> If it be so out with it boldly man Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him <eos> LORD ROSS : No good at all that I can do for him Unless you call it good to pity him Bereft and gelded of his patrimony <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Now afore God 'tis shame such wrongs are borne In him a royal prince and many moe Of noble blood in this declining land <eos> The king is not himself but basely led By flatterers and what they will inform Merely in hate 'gainst any of us all That will the king severely prosecute 'Gainst us our lives our children and our heirs <eos> LORD ROSS : The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes And quite lost their hearts : the nobles hath he fined For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : And daily new exactions are devised As blanks benevolences and I wot not what : But what o' God's name doth become of this <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Wars have not wasted it for warr'd he hath not But basely yielded upon compromise That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows : More hath he spent in peace than they in wars <eos> LORD ROSS : The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : The king's grown bankrupt like a broken man <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him <eos> LORD ROSS : He hath not money for these Irish wars His burthenous taxations notwithstanding But by the robbing of the banish'd duke <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : His noble kinsman : most degenerate king <eos> But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm We see the wind sit sore upon our sails And yet we strike not but securely perish <eos> LORD ROSS : We see the very wreck that we must suffer And unavoided is the danger now For suffering so the causes of our wreck <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Not so even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering but I dare not say How near the tidings of our comfort is <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : Nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours <eos> LORD ROSS : Be confident to speak Northumberland : We three are but thyself and speaking so Thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Then thus : I have from Port le Blanc a bay In Brittany received intelligence That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham That late broke from the Duke of Exeter His brother Archbishop late of Canterbury Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston Sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne With eight tall ships three thousand men of war Are making hither with all due expedience And shortly mean to touch our northern shore : Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay The first departing of the king for Ireland <eos> If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke Imp out our drooping country's broken wing Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt And make high majesty look like itself Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh But if you faint as fearing to do so Stay and be secret and myself will go <eos> LORD ROSS : To horse to horse <eos> urge doubts to them that fear <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : Hold out my horse and I will first be there <eos> BUSHY : Madam your majesty is too much sad : You promised when you parted with the king To lay aside life-harming heaviness And entertain a cheerful disposition <eos> QUEEN : To please the king I did to please myself I cannot do it yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as grief Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard : yet again methinks Some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb Is coming towards me and my inward soul With nothing trembles : at some thing it grieves More than with parting from my lord the king <eos> BUSHY : Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows Which shows like grief itself but is not so For sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears Divides one thing entire to many objects Like perspectives which rightly gazed upon Show nothing but confusion eyed awry Distinguish form : so your sweet majesty Looking awry upon your lord's departure Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail Which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows Of what it is not <eos> Then thrice-gracious queen More than your lord's departure weep not : more's not seen Or if it be 'tis with false sorrow's eye Which for things true weeps things imaginary <eos> QUEEN : It may be so but yet my inward soul Persuades me it is otherwise : howe'er it be I cannot but be sad so heavy sad As though on thinking on no thought I think Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink <eos> BUSHY : 'Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady <eos> QUEEN : 'Tis nothing less : conceit is still derived From some forefather grief mine is not so For nothing had begot my something grief Or something hath the nothing that I grieve : 'Tis in reversion that I do possess But what it is that is not yet known what I cannot name 'tis nameless woe I wot <eos> GREEN : God save your majesty <eos> and well met gentlemen : I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland <eos> QUEEN : Why hopest thou so <eos> 'tis better hope he is For his designs crave haste his haste good hope : Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd <eos> GREEN : That he our hope might have retired his power And driven into despair an enemy's hope Who strongly hath set footing in this land : The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself And with uplifted arms is safe arrived At Ravenspurgh <eos> QUEEN : Now God in heaven forbid <eos> GREEN : Ah madam 'tis too true : and that is worse The Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby With all their powerful friends are fled to him <eos> BUSHY : Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland And all the rest revolted faction traitors <eos> GREEN : We have : whereupon the Earl of Worcester Hath broke his staff resign'd his stewardship And all the household servants fled with him To Bolingbroke <eos> QUEEN : So Green thou art the midwife to my woe And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir : Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy And I a gasping new-deliver'd mother Have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd <eos> BUSHY : Despair not madam <eos> QUEEN : Who shall hinder me <eos> I will despair and be at enmity With cozening hope : he is a flatterer A parasite a keeper back of death Who gently would dissolve the bands of life Which false hope lingers in extremity <eos> GREEN : Here comes the Duke of York <eos> QUEEN : With signs of war about his aged neck : O full of careful business are his looks <eos> Uncle for God's sake speak comfortable words <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Should I do so I should belie my thoughts : Comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth Where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief <eos> Your husband he is gone to save far off Whilst others come to make him lose at home : Here am I left to underprop his land Who weak with age cannot support myself : Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him <eos> Servant : My lord your son was gone before I came <eos> DUKE OF YORK : He was <eos> Why so <eos> go all which way it will <eos> The nobles they are fled the commons they are cold And will I fear revolt on Hereford's side <eos> Sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester Bid her send me presently a thousand pound : Hold take my ring <eos> Servant : My lord I had forgot to tell your lordship To-day as I came by I called there But I shall grieve you to report the rest <eos> DUKE OF YORK : What is't knave <eos> Servant : An hour before I came the duchess died <eos> DUKE OF YORK : God for his mercy <eos> what a tide of woes Comes rushing on this woeful land at once <eos> I know not what to do : I would to God So my untruth had not provoked him to it The king had cut off my head with my brother's <eos> What are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland <eos> How shall we do for money for these wars <eos> Come sister <eos>cousin I would say <eos>pray pardon me <eos> Go fellow get thee home provide some carts And bring away the armour that is there <eos> Gentlemen will you go muster men <eos> If I know how or which way to order these affairs Thus thrust disorderly into my hands Never believe me <eos> Both are my kinsmen : The one is my sovereign whom both my oath And duty bids defend the other again Is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong'd Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right <eos> Well somewhat we must do <eos> Come cousin I'll Dispose of you <eos> Gentlemen go muster up your men And meet me presently at Berkeley <eos> I should to Plashy too But time will not permit : all is uneven And every thing is left at six and seven <eos> BUSHY : The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland But none returns <eos> For us to levy power Proportionable to the enemy Is all unpossible <eos> GREEN : Besides our nearness to the king in love Is near the hate of those love not the king <eos> BAGOT : And that's the wavering commons : for their love Lies in their purses and whoso empties them By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate <eos> BUSHY : Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd <eos> BAGOT : If judgement lie in them then so do we Because we ever have been near the king <eos> GREEN : Well I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle : The Earl of Wiltshire is already there <eos> BUSHY : Thither will I with you for little office The hateful commons will perform for us Except like curs to tear us all to pieces <eos> Will you go along with us <eos> BAGOT : No I will to Ireland to his majesty <eos> Farewell : if heart's presages be not vain We three here art that ne'er shall meet again <eos> BUSHY : That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke <eos> GREEN : Alas poor duke <eos> the task he undertakes Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry : Where one on his side fights thousands will fly <eos> Farewell at once for once for all and ever <eos> BUSHY : Well we may meet again <eos> BAGOT : I fear me never <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : How far is it my lord to Berkeley now <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Believe me noble lord I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire : These high wild hills and rough uneven ways Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar Making the hard way sweet and delectable <eos> But I bethink me what a weary way From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company Which I protest hath very much beguiled The tediousness and process of my travel : But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoy'd : by this the weary lords Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done By sight of what I have your noble company <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Of much less value is my company Than your good words <eos> But who comes here <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : It is my son young Harry Percy Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever <eos> Harry how fares your uncle <eos> HENRY PERCY : I had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Why is he not with the queen <eos> HENRY PERCY : No my good Lord he hath forsook the court Broken his staff of office and dispersed The household of the king <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : What was his reason <eos> He was not so resolved when last we spake together <eos> HENRY PERCY : Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor <eos> But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy <eos> HENRY PERCY : No my good lord for that is not forgot Which ne'er I did remember : to my knowledge I never in my life did look on him <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Then learn to know him now this is the duke <eos> HENRY PERCY : My gracious lord I tender you my service Such as it is being tender raw and young : Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desert <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul remembering my good friends And as my fortune ripens with thy love It shall be still thy true love's recompense : My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : How far is it to Berkeley <eos> and what stir Keeps good old York there with his men of war <eos> HENRY PERCY : There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees Mann'd with three hundred men as I have heard And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour None else of name and noble estimate <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby Bloody with spurring fiery-red with haste <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Welcome my lords <eos> I wot your love pursues A banish'd traitor : all my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd Shall be your love and labour's recompense <eos> LORD ROSS : Your presence makes us rich most noble lord <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : And far surmounts our labour to attain it <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor Which till my infant fortune comes to years Stands for my bounty <eos> But who comes here <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess <eos> LORD BERKELEY : My Lord of Hereford my message is to you <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : My lord my answer is <eos>to Lancaster And I am come to seek that name in England And I must find that title in your tongue Before I make reply to aught you say <eos> LORD BERKELEY : Mistake me not my lord 'tis not my meaning To raze one title of your honour out : To you my lord I come what lord you will From the most gracious regent of this land The Duke of York to know what pricks you on To take advantage of the absent time And fright our native peace with self-born arms <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I shall not need transport my words by you Here comes his grace in person <eos> My noble uncle <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee Whose duty is deceiveable and false <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : My gracious uncle <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Tut tut <eos> Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle : I am no traitor's uncle and that word 'grace <eos>' In an ungracious mouth is but profane <eos> Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground <eos> But then more 'why <eos>' why have they dared to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom Frighting her pale-faced villages with war And ostentation of despised arms <eos> Comest thou because the anointed king is hence <eos> Why foolish boy the king is left behind And in my loyal bosom lies his power <eos> Were I but now the lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men From forth the ranks of many thousand French O then how quickly should this arm of mine <eos> Now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee And minister correction to thy fault <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : My gracious uncle let me know my fault : On what condition stands it and wherein <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Even in condition of the worst degree In gross rebellion and detested treason : Thou art a banish'd man and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereign <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : As I was banish'd I was banish'd Hereford But as I come I come for Lancaster <eos> And noble uncle I beseech your grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye : You are my father for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O then my father Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts <eos> Wherefore was I born <eos> If that my cousin king be King of England It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster <eos> You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin Had you first died and he been thus trod down He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay <eos> I am denied to sue my livery here And yet my letters-patents give me leave : My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold And these and all are all amiss employ'd <eos> What would you have me do <eos> I am a subject And I challenge law : attorneys are denied me And therefore personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descent <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : The noble duke hath been too much abused <eos> LORD ROSS : It stands your grace upon to do him right <eos> LORD WILLOUGHBY : Base men by his endowments are made great <eos> DUKE OF YORK : My lords of England let me tell you this : I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs And laboured all I could to do him right But in this kind to come in braving arms Be his own carver and cut out his way To find out right with wrong it may not be And you that do abet him in this kind Cherish rebellion and are rebels all <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : The noble duke hath sworn his coming is But for his own and for the right of that We all have strongly sworn to give him aid And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Well well I see the issue of these arms : I cannot mend it I must needs confess Because my power is weak and all ill left : But if I could by Him that gave me life I would attach you all and make you stoop Unto the sovereign mercy of the king But since I cannot be it known to you I do remain as neuter <eos> So fare you well Unless you please to enter in the castle And there repose you for this night <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : An offer uncle that we will accept : But we must win your grace to go with us To Bristol castle which they say is held By Bushy Bagot and their complices The caterpillars of the commonwealth Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away <eos> DUKE OF YORK : It may be I will go with you : but yet I'll pause For I am loath to break our country's laws <eos> Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are : Things past redress are now with me past care <eos> Captain : My lord of Salisbury we have stay'd ten days And hardly kept our countrymen together And yet we hear no tidings from the king Therefore we will disperse ourselves : farewell <eos> EARL OF SALISBURY : Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman : The king reposeth all his confidence in thee <eos> Captain : 'Tis thought the king is dead we will not stay <eos> The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap The one in fear to lose what they enjoy The other to enjoy by rage and war : These signs forerun the death or fall of kings <eos> Farewell : our countrymen are gone and fled As well assured Richard their king is dead <eos> EARL OF SALISBURY : Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament <eos> Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest : Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes And crossly to thy good all fortune goes <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Bring forth these men <eos> Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls <eos> Since presently your souls must part your bodies <eos> With too much urging your pernicious lives For 'twere no charity yet to wash your blood From off my hands here in the view of men I will unfold some causes of your deaths <eos> You have misled a prince a royal king A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments By you unhappied and disfigured clean : You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him Broke the possession of a royal bed And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs <eos> Myself a prince by fortune of my birth Near to the king in blood and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds Eating the bitter bread of banishment Whilst you have fed upon my signories Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods From my own windows torn my household coat Razed out my imprese leaving me no sign Save men's opinions and my living blood To show the world I am a gentleman <eos> This and much more much more than twice all this Condemns you to the death <eos> See them deliver'd over To execution and the hand of death <eos> BUSHY : More welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England <eos> Lords farewell <eos> GREEN : My comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hell <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : My Lord Northumberland see them dispatch'd <eos> Uncle you say the queen is at your house For God's sake fairly let her be entreated : Tell her I send to her my kind commends Take special care my greetings be deliver'd <eos> DUKE OF YORK : A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd With letters of your love to her at large <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Thank gentle uncle <eos> Come lords away <eos> To fight with Glendower and his complices : Awhile to work and after holiday <eos> KING RICHARD II : Barkloughly castle call they this at hand <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Yea my lord <eos> How brooks your grace the air After your late tossing on the breaking seas <eos> KING RICHARD II : Needs must I like it well : I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again <eos> Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs : As a long-parted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting So weeping smiling greet I thee my earth And do thee favours with my royal hands <eos> Feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet Which with usurping steps do trample thee : Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies <eos> Mock not my senseless conjuration lords : This earth shall have a feeling and these stones Prove armed soldiers ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms <eos> BISHOP OF CARLISLE : Fear not my lord : that Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all <eos> The means that heaven yields must be embraced And not neglected else if heaven would And we will not heaven's offer we refuse The proffer'd means of succor and redress <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : He means my lord that we are too remiss Whilst Bolingbroke through our security Grows strong and great in substance and in power <eos> KING RICHARD II : Discomfortable cousin <eos> know'st thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid Behind the globe that lights the lower world Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage boldly here But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole Then murders treasons and detested sins The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves <eos> So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke Who all this while hath revell'd in the night Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes Shall see us rising in our throne the east His treasons will sit blushing in his face Not able to endure the sight of day But self-affrighted tremble at his sin <eos> Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy elected by the Lord : For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel : then if angels fight Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right <eos> Welcome my lord how far off lies your power <eos> EARL OF SALISBURY : Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord Than this weak arm : discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair <eos> One day too late I fear me noble lord Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth : O call back yesterday bid time return And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men <eos> To-day to-day unhappy day too late O'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state : For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead <eos> Are gone to Bolingbroke dispersed and fled <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale <eos> KING RICHARD II : But now the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face and they are fled And till so much blood thither come again Have I not reason to look pale and dead <eos> All souls that will be safe fly from my side For time hath set a blot upon my pride <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Comfort my liege remember who you are <eos> KING RICHARD II : I had forgot myself am I not king <eos> Awake thou coward majesty <eos> thou sleepest <eos> Is not the king's name twenty thousand names <eos> Arm arm my name <eos> a puny subject strikes At thy great glory <eos> Look not to the ground Ye favourites of a king : are we not high <eos> High be our thoughts : I know my uncle York Hath power enough to serve our turn <eos> But who comes here <eos> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP : More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him <eos> KING RICHARD II : Mine ear is open and my heart prepared The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold <eos> Say is my kingdom lost <eos> why 'twas my care And what loss is it to be rid of care <eos> Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we <eos> Greater he shall not be if he serve God We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so : Revolt our subjects <eos> that we cannot mend They break their faith to God as well as us : Cry woe destruction ruin and decay : The worst is death and death will have his day <eos> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP : Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd To bear the tidings of calamity <eos> Like an unseasonable stormy day Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores As if the world were all dissolved to tears So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel <eos> White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty boys with women's voices Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown : The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of double-fatal yew against thy state Yea distaff-women manage rusty bills Against thy seat : both young and old rebel And all goes worse than I have power to tell <eos> KING RICHARD II : Too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill <eos> Where is the Earl of Wiltshire <eos> where is Bagot <eos> What is become of Bushy <eos> where is Green <eos> That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps <eos> If we prevail their heads shall pay for it : I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke <eos> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP : Peace have they made with him indeed my lord <eos> KING RICHARD II : O villains vipers damn'd without redemption <eos> Dogs easily won to fawn on any man <eos> Snakes in my heart-blood warm'd that sting my heart <eos> Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas <eos> Would they make peace <eos> terrible hell make war Upon their spotted souls for this offence <eos> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP : Sweet love I see changing his property Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate : Again uncurse their souls their peace is made With heads and not with hands those whom you curse Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound And lie full low graved in the hollow ground <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead <eos> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP : Ay all of them at Bristol lost their heads <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Where is the duke my father with his power <eos> KING RICHARD II : No matter where of comfort no man speak : Let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth Let's choose executors and talk of wills : And yet not so for what can we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground <eos> Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbroke's And nothing can we call our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones <eos> For God's sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings How some have been deposed some slain in war Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed Some poison'd by their wives : some sleeping kill'd All murder'd : for within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp Allowing him a breath a little scene To monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks Infusing him with self and vain conceit As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass impregnable and humour'd thus Comes at the last and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall and farewell king <eos> Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence : throw away respect Tradition form and ceremonious duty For you have but mistook me all this while : I live with bread like you feel want Taste grief need friends : subjected thus How can you say to me I am a king <eos> BISHOP OF CARLISLE : My lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes But presently prevent the ways to wail <eos> To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe And so your follies fight against yourself <eos> Fear and be slain no worse can come to fight : And fight and die is death destroying death Where fearing dying pays death servile breath <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : My father hath a power inquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb <eos> KING RICHARD II : Thou chidest me well : proud Bolingbroke I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom <eos> This ague fit of fear is over-blown An easy task it is to win our own <eos> Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power <eos> Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour <eos> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP : Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state and inclination of the day : So may you by my dull and heavy eye My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say <eos> I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken : Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke And all your northern castles yielded up And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party <eos> KING RICHARD II : Thou hast said enough <eos> Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair <eos> What say you now <eos> what comfort have we now <eos> By heaven I'll hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more <eos> Go to Flint castle : there I'll pine away A king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey <eos> That power I have discharge and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow For I have none : let no man speak again To alter this for counsel is but vain <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : My liege one word <eos> KING RICHARD II : He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue <eos> Discharge my followers : let them hence away From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : So that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispersed and Salisbury Is gone to meet the king who lately landed With some few private friends upon this coast <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : The news is very fair and good my lord : Richard not far from hence hath hid his head <eos> DUKE OF YORK : It would beseem the Lord Northumberland To say 'King Richard :' alack the heavy day When such a sacred king should hide his head <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Your grace mistakes only to be brief Left I his title out <eos> DUKE OF YORK : The time hath been Would you have been so brief with him he would Have been so brief with you to shorten you For taking so the head your whole head's length <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Mistake not uncle further than you should <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Take not good cousin further than you should <eos> Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I know it uncle and oppose not myself Against their will <eos> But who comes here <eos> Welcome Harry : what will not this castle yield <eos> HENRY PERCY : The castle royally is mann'd my lord Against thy entrance <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Royally <eos> Why it contains no king <eos> HENRY PERCY : Yes my good lord It doth contain a king King Richard lies Within the limits of yon lime and stone : And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman Of holy reverence who I cannot learn <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Noble lords Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley Into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver : Henry Bolingbroke On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand And sends allegiance and true faith of heart To his most royal person hither come Even at his feet to lay my arms and power Provided that my banishment repeal'd And lands restored again be freely granted : If not I'll use the advantage of my power And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen : The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke It is such crimson tempest should bedrench The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land My stooping duty tenderly shall show <eos> Go signify as much while here we march Upon the grassy carpet of this plain <eos> Let's march without the noise of threatening drum That from this castle's tatter'd battlements Our fair appointments may be well perused <eos> Methinks King Richard and myself should meet With no less terror than the elements Of fire and water when their thundering shock At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven <eos> Be he the fire I'll be the yielding water : The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain My waters on the earth and not on him <eos> March on and mark King Richard how he looks <eos> See see King Richard doth himself appear As doth the blushing discontented sun From out the fiery portal of the east When he perceives the envious clouds are bent To dim his glory and to stain the track Of his bright passage to the occident <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Yet looks he like a king : behold his eye As bright as is the eagle's lightens forth Controlling majesty : alack alack for woe That any harm should stain so fair a show <eos> KING RICHARD II : We are amazed and thus long have we stood To watch the fearful bending of thy knee Because we thought ourself thy lawful king : And if we be how dare thy joints forget To pay their awful duty to our presence <eos> If we be not show us the hand of God That hath dismissed us from our stewardship For well we know no hand of blood and bone Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre Unless he do profane steal or usurp <eos> And though you think that all as you have done Have torn their souls by turning them from us And we are barren and bereft of friends Yet know my master God omnipotent Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf Armies of pestilence and they shall strike Your children yet unborn and unbegot That lift your vassal hands against my head And threat the glory of my precious crown <eos> Tell Bolingbroke <eos>for yond methinks he stands <eos> That every stride he makes upon my land Is dangerous treason : he is come to open The purple testament of bleeding war But ere the crown he looks for live in peace Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons Shall ill become the flower of England's face Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace To scarlet indignation and bedew Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : The king of heaven forbid our lord the king Should so with civil and uncivil arms Be rush'd upon <eos> Thy thrice noble cousin Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand And by the honourable tomb he swears That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones And by the royalties of both your bloods Currents that spring from one most gracious head And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt And by the worth and honour of himself Comprising all that may be sworn or said His coming hither hath no further scope Than for his lineal royalties and to beg Enfranchisement immediate on his knees : Which on thy royal party granted once His glittering arms he will commend to rust His barbed steeds to stables and his heart To faithful service of your majesty <eos> This swears he as he is a prince is just And as I am a gentleman I credit him <eos> KING RICHARD II : Northumberland say thus the king returns : His noble cousin is right welcome hither And all the number of his fair demands Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction : With all the gracious utterance thou hast Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends <eos> We do debase ourselves cousin do we not To look so poorly and to speak so fair <eos> Shall we call back Northumberland and send Defiance to the traitor and so die <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : No good my lord let's fight with gentle words Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords <eos> KING RICHARD II : O God O God <eos> that e'er this tongue of mine That laid the sentence of dread banishment On yon proud man should take it off again With words of sooth <eos> O that I were as great As is my grief or lesser than my name <eos> Or that I could forget what I have been Or not remember what I must be now <eos> Swell'st thou proud heart <eos> I'll give thee scope to beat Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke <eos> KING RICHARD II : What must the king do now <eos> must he submit <eos> The king shall do it : must he be deposed <eos> The king shall be contented : must he lose The name of king <eos> o' God's name let it go : I'll give my jewels for a set of beads My gorgeous palace for a hermitage My gay apparel for an almsman's gown My figured goblets for a dish of wood My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff My subjects for a pair of carved saints And my large kingdom for a little grave A little little grave an obscure grave Or I'll be buried in the king's highway Some way of common trade where subjects' feet May hourly trample on their sovereign's head For on my heart they tread now whilst I live And buried once why not upon my head <eos> Aumerle thou weep'st my tender-hearted cousin <eos> We'll make foul weather with despised tears Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn And make a dearth in this revolting land <eos> Or shall we play the wantons with our woes And make some pretty match with shedding tears <eos> As thus to drop them still upon one place Till they have fretted us a pair of graves Within the earth and therein laid <eos>there lies Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes <eos> Would not this ill do well <eos> Well well I see I talk but idly and you laugh at me <eos> Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland What says King Bolingbroke <eos> will his majesty Give Richard leave to live till Richard die <eos> You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : My lord in the base court he doth attend To speak with you may it please you to come down <eos> KING RICHARD II : Down down I come like glistering Phaethon Wanting the manage of unruly jades <eos> In the base court <eos> Base court where kings grow base To come at traitors' calls and do them grace <eos> In the base court <eos> Come down <eos> Down court <eos> down king <eos> For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : What says his majesty <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Sorrow and grief of heart Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man Yet he is come <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Stand all apart And show fair duty to his majesty <eos> My gracious lord <eos> KING RICHARD II : Fair cousin you debase your princely knee To make the base earth proud with kissing it : Me rather had my heart might feel your love Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy <eos> Up cousin up your heart is up I know Thus high at least although your knee be low <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : My gracious lord I come but for mine own <eos> KING RICHARD II : Your own is yours and I am yours and all <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : So far be mine my most redoubted lord As my true service shall deserve your love <eos> KING RICHARD II : Well you deserve : they well deserve to have That know the strong'st and surest way to get <eos> Uncle give me your hands : nay dry your eyes Tears show their love but want their remedies <eos> Cousin I am too young to be your father Though you are old enough to be my heir <eos> What you will have I'll give and willing too For do we must what force will have us do <eos> Set on towards London cousin is it so <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Yea my good lord <eos> KING RICHARD II : Then I must not say no <eos> QUEEN : What sport shall we devise here in this garden To drive away the heavy thought of care <eos> Lady : Madam we'll play at bowls <eos> QUEEN : 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs And that my fortune rubs against the bias <eos> Lady : Madam we'll dance <eos> QUEEN : My legs can keep no measure in delight When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief : Therefore no dancing girl some other sport <eos> Lady : Madam we'll tell tales <eos> QUEEN : Of sorrow or of joy <eos> Lady : Of either madam <eos> QUEEN : Of neither girl : For of joy being altogether wanting It doth remember me the more of sorrow Or if of grief being altogether had It adds more sorrow to my want of joy : For what I have I need not to repeat And what I want it boots not to complain <eos> Lady : Madam I'll sing <eos> QUEEN : 'Tis well that thou hast cause But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep <eos> Lady : I could weep madam would it do you good <eos> QUEEN : And I could sing would weeping do me good And never borrow any tear of thee <eos> But stay here come the gardeners : Let's step into the shadow of these trees <eos> My wretchedness unto a row of pins They'll talk of state for every one doth so Against a change woe is forerun with woe <eos> Gardener : Go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks Which like unruly children make their sire Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight : Give some supportance to the bending twigs <eos> Go thou and like an executioner Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays That look too lofty in our commonwealth : All must be even in our government <eos> You thus employ'd I will go root away The noisome weeds which without profit suck The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers <eos> Servant : Why should we in the compass of a pale Keep law and form and due proportion Showing as in a model our firm estate When our sea-walled garden the whole land Is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up Her fruit-trees all upturned her hedges ruin'd Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs Swarming with caterpillars <eos> Gardener : Hold thy peace : He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf : The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter That seem'd in eating him to hold him up Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green <eos> Servant : What are they dead <eos> Gardener : They are and Bolingbroke Hath seized the wasteful king <eos> O what pity is it That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land As we this garden <eos> We at time of year Do wound the bark the skin of our fruit-trees Lest being over-proud in sap and blood With too much riches it confound itself : Had he done so to great and growing men They might have lived to bear and he to taste Their fruits of duty : superfluous branches We lop away that bearing boughs may live : Had he done so himself had borne the crown Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down <eos> Servant : What think you then the king shall be deposed <eos> Gardener : Depress'd he is already and deposed 'Tis doubt he will be : letters came last night To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's That tell black tidings <eos> QUEEN : O I am press'd to death through want of speaking <eos> Thou old Adam's likeness set to dress this garden How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news <eos> What Eve what serpent hath suggested thee To make a second fall of cursed man <eos> Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed <eos> Darest thou thou little better thing than earth Divine his downfall <eos> Say where when and how Camest thou by this ill tidings <eos> speak thou wretch <eos> Gardener : Pardon me madam : little joy have I To breathe this news yet what I say is true <eos> King Richard he is in the mighty hold Of Bolingbroke : their fortunes both are weigh'd : In your lord's scale is nothing but himself And some few vanities that make him light But in the balance of great Bolingbroke Besides himself are all the English peers And with that odds he weighs King Richard down <eos> Post you to London and you will find it so I speak no more than every one doth know <eos> QUEEN : Nimble mischance that art so light of foot Doth not thy embassage belong to me And am I last that knows it <eos> O thou think'st To serve me last that I may longest keep Thy sorrow in my breast <eos> Come ladies go To meet at London London's king in woe <eos> What was I born to this that my sad look Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke <eos> Gardener for telling me these news of woe Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow <eos> GARDENER : Poor queen <eos> so that thy state might be no worse I would my skill were subject to thy curse <eos> Here did she fall a tear here in this place I'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace : Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen In the remembrance of a weeping queen <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Call forth Bagot <eos> Now Bagot freely speak thy mind What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death Who wrought it with the king and who perform'd The bloody office of his timeless end <eos> BAGOT : Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Cousin stand forth and look upon that man <eos> BAGOT : My Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd <eos> In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted I heard you say 'Is not my arm of length That reacheth from the restful English court As far as Calais to mine uncle's head <eos>' Amongst much other talk that very time I heard you say that you had rather refuse The offer of an hundred thousand crowns Than Bolingbroke's return to England Adding withal how blest this land would be In this your cousin's death <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Princes and noble lords What answer shall I make to this base man <eos> Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars On equal terms to give him chastisement <eos> Either I must or have mine honour soil'd With the attainder of his slanderous lips <eos> There is my gage the manual seal of death That marks thee out for hell : I say thou liest And will maintain what thou hast said is false In thy heart-blood though being all too base To stain the temper of my knightly sword <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Excepting one I would he were the best In all this presence that hath moved me so <eos> LORD FITZWATER : If that thy valour stand on sympathy There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine : By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death <eos> If thou deny'st it twenty times thou liest And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart Where it was forged with my rapier's point <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Thou darest not coward live to see that day <eos> LORD FITZWATER : Now by my soul I would it were this hour <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this <eos> HENRY PERCY : Aumerle thou liest his honour is as true In this appeal as thou art all unjust And that thou art so there I throw my gage To prove it on thee to the extremest point Of mortal breathing : seize it if thou darest <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : An if I do not may my hands rot off And never brandish more revengeful steel Over the glittering helmet of my foe <eos> Lord : I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle And spur thee on with full as many lies As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear From sun to sun : there is my honour's pawn Engage it to the trial if thou darest <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Who sets me else <eos> by heaven I'll throw at all : I have a thousand spirits in one breast To answer twenty thousand such as you <eos> DUKE OF SURREY : My Lord Fitzwater I do remember well The very time Aumerle and you did talk <eos> LORD FITZWATER : 'Tis very true : you were in presence then And you can witness with me this is true <eos> DUKE OF SURREY : As false by heaven as heaven itself is true <eos> LORD FITZWATER : Surrey thou liest <eos> DUKE OF SURREY : Dishonourable boy <eos> That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword That it shall render vengeance and revenge Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie In earth as quiet as thy father's skull : In proof whereof there is my honour's pawn Engage it to the trial if thou darest <eos> LORD FITZWATER : How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse <eos> If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness And spit upon him whilst I say he lies And lies and lies : there is my bond of faith To tie thee to my strong correction <eos> As I intend to thrive in this new world Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal : Besides I heard the banish'd Norfolk say That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men To execute the noble duke at Calais <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Some honest Christian trust me with a gage That Norfolk lies : here do I throw down this If he may be repeal'd to try his honour <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : These differences shall all rest under gage Till Norfolk be repeal'd : repeal'd he shall be And though mine enemy restored again To all his lands and signories : when he's return'd Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial <eos> BISHOP OF CARLISLE : That honourable day shall ne'er be seen <eos> Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross Against black pagans Turks and Saracens : And toil'd with works of war retired himself To Italy and there at Venice gave His body to that pleasant country's earth And his pure soul unto his captain Christ Under whose colours he had fought so long <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Why bishop is Norfolk dead <eos> BISHOP OF CARLISLE : As surely as I live my lord <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom Of good old Abraham <eos> Lords appellants Your differences shall all rest under gage Till we assign you to your days of trial <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Great Duke of Lancaster I come to thee From plume-pluck'd Richard who with willing soul Adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields To the possession of thy royal hand : Ascend his throne descending now from him And long live Henry fourth of that name <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : In God's name I'll ascend the regal throne <eos> BISHOP OF CARLISLE : Marry <eos> God forbid <eos> Worst in this royal presence may I speak Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth <eos> Would God that any in this noble presence Were enough noble to be upright judge Of noble Richard <eos> then true noblesse would Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong <eos> What subject can give sentence on his king <eos> And who sits here that is not Richard's subject <eos> Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear Although apparent guilt be seen in them And shall the figure of God's majesty His captain steward deputy-elect Anointed crowned planted many years Be judged by subject and inferior breath And he himself not present <eos> O forfend it God That in a Christian climate souls refined Should show so heinous black obscene a deed <eos> I speak to subjects and a subject speaks Stirr'd up by God thus boldly for his king : My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king : And if you crown him let me prophesy : The blood of English shall manure the ground And future ages groan for this foul act Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound Disorder horror fear and mutiny Shall here inhabit and this land be call'd The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls <eos> O if you raise this house against this house It will the woefullest division prove That ever fell upon this cursed earth <eos> Prevent it resist it let it not be so Lest child child's children cry against you woe <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Well have you argued sir and for your pains Of capital treason we arrest you here <eos> My Lord of Westminster be it your charge To keep him safely till his day of trial <eos> May it please you lords to grant the commons' suit <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Fetch hither Richard that in common view He may surrender so we shall proceed Without suspicion <eos> DUKE OF YORK : I will be his conduct <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Lords you that here are under our arrest Procure your sureties for your days of answer <eos> Little are we beholding to your love And little look'd for at your helping hands <eos> KING RICHARD II : Alack why am I sent for to a king Before I have shook off the regal thoughts Wherewith I reign'd <eos> I hardly yet have learn'd To insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs : Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me To this submission <eos> Yet I well remember The favours of these men : were they not mine <eos> Did they not sometime cry 'all hail <eos>' to me <eos> So Judas did to Christ : but he in twelve Found truth in all but one : I in twelve thousand none <eos> God save the king <eos> Will no man say amen <eos> Am I both priest and clerk <eos> well then amen <eos> God save the king <eos> although I be not he And yet amen if heaven do think him me <eos> To do what service am I sent for hither <eos> DUKE OF YORK : To do that office of thine own good will Which tired majesty did make thee offer The resignation of thy state and crown To Henry Bolingbroke <eos> KING RICHARD II : Give me the crown <eos> Here cousin seize the crown Here cousin : On this side my hand and on that side yours <eos> Now is this golden crown like a deep well That owes two buckets filling one another The emptier ever dancing in the air The other down unseen and full of water : That bucket down and full of tears am I Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I thought you had been willing to resign <eos> KING RICHARD II : My crown I am but still my griefs are mine : You may my glories and my state depose But not my griefs still am I king of those <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Part of your cares you give me with your crown <eos> KING RICHARD II : Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down <eos> My care is loss of care by old care done Your care is gain of care by new care won : The cares I give I have though given away They tend the crown yet still with me they stay <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Are you contented to resign the crown <eos> KING RICHARD II : Ay no no ay for I must nothing be Therefore no no for I resign to thee <eos> Now mark me how I will undo myself I give this heavy weight from off my head And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand The pride of kingly sway from out my heart With mine own tears I wash away my balm With mine own hands I give away my crown With mine own tongue deny my sacred state With mine own breath release all duty's rites : All pomp and majesty I do forswear My manors rents revenues I forego My acts decrees and statutes I deny : God pardon all oaths that are broke to me <eos> God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee <eos> Make me that nothing have with nothing grieved And thou with all pleased that hast all achieved <eos> Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit <eos> God save King Harry unking'd Richard says And send him many years of sunshine days <eos> What more remains <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : No more but that you read These accusations and these grievous crimes Committed by your person and your followers Against the state and profit of this land That by confessing them the souls of men May deem that you are worthily deposed <eos> KING RICHARD II : Must I do so <eos> and must I ravel out My weaved-up folly <eos> Gentle Northumberland If thy offences were upon record Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop To read a lecture of them <eos> If thou wouldst There shouldst thou find one heinous article Containing the deposing of a king And cracking the strong warrant of an oath Mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven : Nay all of you that stand and look upon Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands Showing an outward pity yet you Pilates Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross And water cannot wash away your sin <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : My lord dispatch read o'er these articles <eos> KING RICHARD II : Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see : And yet salt water blinds them not so much But they can see a sort of traitors here <eos> Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself I find myself a traitor with the rest For I have given here my soul's consent To undeck the pompous body of a king Made glory base and sovereignty a slave Proud majesty a subject state a peasant <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : My lord <eos> KING RICHARD II : No lord of thine thou haught insulting man Nor no man's lord I have no name no title No not that name was given me at the font But 'tis usurp'd : alack the heavy day That I have worn so many winters out And know not now what name to call myself <eos> O that I were a mockery king of snow Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke To melt myself away in water-drops <eos> Good king great king and yet not greatly good An if my word be sterling yet in England Let it command a mirror hither straight That it may show me what a face I have Since it is bankrupt of his majesty <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come <eos> KING RICHARD II : Fiend thou torment'st me ere I come to hell <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : The commons will not then be satisfied <eos> KING RICHARD II : They shall be satisfied : I'll read enough When I do see the very book indeed Where all my sins are writ and that's myself <eos> Give me the glass and therein will I read <eos> No deeper wrinkles yet <eos> hath sorrow struck So many blows upon this face of mine And made no deeper wounds <eos> O flattering glass Like to my followers in prosperity Thou dost beguile me <eos> Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men <eos> was this the face That like the sun did make beholders wink <eos> Was this the face that faced so many follies And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke <eos> A brittle glory shineth in this face : As brittle as the glory is the face For there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers <eos> Mark silent king the moral of this sport How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd The shadow or your face <eos> KING RICHARD II : Say that again <eos> The shadow of my sorrow <eos> ha <eos> let's see : 'Tis very true my grief lies all within And these external manners of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortured soul There lies the substance : and I thank thee king For thy great bounty that not only givest Me cause to wail but teachest me the way How to lament the cause <eos> I'll beg one boon And then be gone and trouble you no more <eos> Shall I obtain it <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Name it fair cousin <eos> KING RICHARD II : 'Fair cousin' <eos> I am greater than a king : For when I was a king my flatterers Were then but subjects being now a subject I have a king here to my flatterer <eos> Being so great I have no need to beg <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Yet ask <eos> KING RICHARD II : And shall I have <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : You shall <eos> KING RICHARD II : Then give me leave to go <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Whither <eos> KING RICHARD II : Whither you will so I were from your sights <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Go some of you convey him to the Tower <eos> KING RICHARD II : O good <eos> convey <eos> conveyers are you all That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : On Wednesday next we solemnly set down Our coronation : lords prepare yourselves <eos> Abbot : A woeful pageant have we here beheld <eos> BISHOP OF CARLISLE : The woe's to come the children yet unborn <eos> Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : You holy clergymen is there no plot To rid the realm of this pernicious blot <eos> Abbot : My lord Before I freely speak my mind herein You shall not only take the sacrament To bury mine intents but also to effect Whatever I shall happen to devise <eos> I see your brows are full of discontent Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears : Come home with me to supper and I'll lay A plot shall show us all a merry day <eos> QUEEN : This way the king will come this is the way To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower To whose flint bosom my condemned lord Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke : Here let us rest if this rebellious earth Have any resting for her true king's queen <eos> But soft but see or rather do not see My fair rose wither : yet look up behold That you in pity may dissolve to dew And wash him fresh again with true-love tears <eos> Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand Thou map of honour thou King Richard's tomb And not King Richard thou most beauteous inn Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee When triumph is become an alehouse guest <eos> KING RICHARD II : Join not with grief fair woman do not so To make my end too sudden : learn good soul To think our former state a happy dream From which awaked the truth of what we are Shows us but this : I am sworn brother sweet To grim Necessity and he and I Will keep a league till death <eos> Hie thee to France And cloister thee in some religious house : Our holy lives must win a new world's crown Which our profane hours here have stricken down <eos> QUEEN : What is my Richard both in shape and mind Transform'd and weaken'd <eos> hath Bolingbroke deposed Thine intellect <eos> hath he been in thy heart <eos> The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage To be o'erpower'd and wilt thou pupil-like Take thy correction mildly kiss the rod And fawn on rage with base humility Which art a lion and a king of beasts <eos> KING RICHARD II : A king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts I had been still a happy king of men <eos> Good sometime queen prepare thee hence for France : Think I am dead and that even here thou takest As from my death-bed thy last living leave <eos> In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs Tell thou the lamentable tale of me And send the hearers weeping to their beds : For why the senseless brands will sympathize The heavy accent of thy moving tongue And in compassion weep the fire out And some will mourn in ashes some coal-black For the deposing of a rightful king <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changed : You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower <eos> And madam there is order ta'en for you With all swift speed you must away to France <eos> KING RICHARD II : Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne The time shall not be many hours of age More than it is ere foul sin gathering head Shalt break into corruption : thou shalt think Though he divide the realm and give thee half It is too little helping him to all And he shall think that thou which know'st the way To plant unrightful kings wilt know again Being ne'er so little urged another way To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne <eos> The love of wicked men converts to fear That fear to hate and hate turns one or both To worthy danger and deserved death <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : My guilt be on my head and there an end <eos> Take leave and part for you must part forthwith <eos> KING RICHARD II : Doubly divorced <eos> Bad men you violate A twofold marriage 'twixt my crown and me And then betwixt me and my married wife <eos> Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me And yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made <eos> Part us Northumberland I toward the north Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime My wife to France : from whence set forth in pomp She came adorned hither like sweet May Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day <eos> QUEEN : And must we be divided <eos> must we part <eos> KING RICHARD II : Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart <eos> QUEEN : Banish us both and send the king with me <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : That were some love but little policy <eos> QUEEN : Then whither he goes thither let me go <eos> KING RICHARD II : So two together weeping make one woe <eos> Weep thou for me in France I for thee here Better far off than near be ne'er the near <eos> Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans <eos> QUEEN : So longest way shall have the longest moans <eos> KING RICHARD II : Twice for one step I'll groan the way being short And piece the way out with a heavy heart <eos> Come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief Since wedding it there is such length in grief One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart <eos> QUEEN : Give me mine own again 'twere no good part To take on me to keep and kill thy heart <eos> So now I have mine own again be gone That I might strive to kill it with a groan <eos> KING RICHARD II : We make woe wanton with this fond delay : Once more adieu the rest let sorrow say <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : My lord you told me you would tell the rest When weeping made you break the story off of our two cousins coming into London <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Where did I leave <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : At that sad stop my lord Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Then as I said the duke great Bolingbroke Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know With slow but stately pace kept on his course Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee Bolingbroke <eos>' You would have thought the very windows spake So many greedy looks of young and old Through casements darted their desiring eyes Upon his visage and that all the walls With painted imagery had said at once 'Jesu preserve thee <eos> welcome Bolingbroke <eos>' Whilst he from the one side to the other turning Bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck Bespake them thus : 'I thank you countrymen :' And thus still doing thus he pass'd along <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Alack poor Richard <eos> where rode he the whilst <eos> DUKE OF YORK : As in a theatre the eyes of men After a well-graced actor leaves the stage Are idly bent on him that enters next Thinking his prattle to be tedious Even so or with much more contempt men's eyes Did scowl on gentle Richard no man cried 'God save him <eos>' No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home : But dust was thrown upon his sacred head : Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off His face still combating with tears and smiles The badges of his grief and patience That had not God for some strong purpose steel'd The hearts of men they must perforce have melted And barbarism itself have pitied him <eos> But heaven hath a hand in these events To whose high will we bound our calm contents <eos> To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now Whose state and honour I for aye allow <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Here comes my son Aumerle <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Aumerle that was But that is lost for being Richard's friend And madam you must call him Rutland now : I am in parliament pledge for his truth And lasting fealty to the new-made king <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Welcome my son : who are the violets now That strew the green lap of the new come spring <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Madam I know not nor I greatly care not : God knows I had as lief be none as one <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Well bear you well in this new spring of time Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime <eos> What news from Oxford <eos> hold those justs and triumphs <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : For aught I know my lord they do <eos> DUKE OF YORK : You will be there I know <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : If God prevent not I purpose so <eos> DUKE OF YORK : What seal is that that hangs without thy bosom <eos> Yea look'st thou pale <eos> let me see the writing <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : My lord 'tis nothing <eos> DUKE OF YORK : No matter then who see it I will be satisfied let me see the writing <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : I do beseech your grace to pardon me : It is a matter of small consequence Which for some reasons I would not have seen <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Which for some reasons sir I mean to see <eos> I fear I fear <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : What should you fear <eos> 'Tis nothing but some bond that he is enter'd into For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Bound to himself <eos> what doth he with a bond That he is bound to <eos> Wife thou art a fool <eos> Boy let me see the writing <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it <eos> DUKE OF YORK : I will be satisfied let me see it I say <eos> Treason <eos> foul treason <eos> Villain <eos> traitor <eos> slave <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : What is the matter my lord <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Ho <eos> who is within there <eos> Saddle my horse <eos> God for his mercy what treachery is here <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Why what is it my lord <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Give me my boots I say saddle my horse <eos> Now by mine honour by my life by my troth I will appeach the villain <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : What is the matter <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Peace foolish woman <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I will not peace <eos> What is the matter Aumerle <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Good mother be content it is no more Than my poor life must answer <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Thy life answer <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Bring me my boots : I will unto the king <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Strike him Aumerle <eos> Poor boy thou art amazed <eos> Hence villain <eos> never more come in my sight <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Give me my boots I say <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Why York what wilt thou do <eos> Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own <eos> Have we more sons <eos> or are we like to have <eos> Is not my teeming date drunk up with time <eos> And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age And rob me of a happy mother's name <eos> Is he not like thee <eos> is he not thine own <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Thou fond mad woman Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy <eos> A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament And interchangeably set down their hands To kill the king at Oxford <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : He shall be none We'll keep him here : then what is that to him <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Away fond woman <eos> were he twenty times my son I would appeach him <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Hadst thou groan'd for him As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful <eos> But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect That I have been disloyal to thy bed And that he is a bastard not thy son : Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind : He is as like thee as a man may be Not like to me or any of my kin And yet I love him <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Make way unruly woman <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : After Aumerle <eos> mount thee upon his horse Spur post and get before him to the king And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee <eos> I'll not be long behind though I be old I doubt not but to ride as fast as York : And never will I rise up from the ground Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee <eos> Away be gone <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son <eos> 'Tis full three months since I did see him last If any plague hang over us 'tis he <eos> I would to God my lords he might be found : Inquire at London 'mongst the taverns there For there they say he daily doth frequent With unrestrained loose companions Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes And beat our watch and rob our passengers Which he young wanton and effeminate boy Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crew <eos> HENRY PERCY : My lord some two days since I saw the prince And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : And what said the gallant <eos> HENRY PERCY : His answer was he would unto the stews And from the common'st creature pluck a glove And wear it as a favour and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : As dissolute as desperate yet through both I see some sparks of better hope which elder years May happily bring forth <eos> But who comes here <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Where is the king <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : What means our cousin that he stares and looks So wildly <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : God save your grace <eos> I do beseech your majesty To have some conference with your grace alone <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone <eos> What is the matter with our cousin now <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : For ever may my knees grow to the earth My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Intended or committed was this fault <eos> If on the first how heinous e'er it be To win thy after-love I pardon thee <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Then give me leave that I may turn the key That no man enter till my tale be done <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Have thy desire <eos> DUKE OF YORK : HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Villain I'll make thee safe <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear <eos> DUKE OF YORK : HENRY BOLINGBROKE : What is the matter uncle <eos> speak Recover breath tell us how near is danger That we may arm us to encounter it <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd : I do repent me read not my name there My heart is not confederate with my hand <eos> DUKE OF YORK : It was villain ere thy hand did set it down <eos> I tore it from the traitor's bosom king Fear and not love begets his penitence : Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : O heinous strong and bold conspiracy <eos> O loyal father of a treacherous son <eos> Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain From when this stream through muddy passages Hath held his current and defiled himself <eos> Thy overflow of good converts to bad And thy abundant goodness shall excuse This deadly blot in thy digressing son <eos> DUKE OF YORK : So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd And he shall spend mine honour with his shame As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold <eos> Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies : Thou kill'st me in his life giving him breath The traitor lives the true man's put to death <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : HENRY BOLINGBROKE : What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : A woman and thy aunt great king 'tis I <eos> Speak with me pity me open the door <eos> A beggar begs that never begg'd before <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King <eos>' My dangerous cousin let your mother in : I know she is come to pray for your foul sin <eos> DUKE OF YORK : If thou do pardon whosoever pray More sins for this forgiveness prosper may <eos> This fester'd joint cut off the rest rest sound This let alone will all the rest confound <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : O king believe not this hard-hearted man <eos> Love loving not itself none other can <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Thou frantic woman what dost thou make here <eos> Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Sweet York be patient <eos> Hear me gentle liege <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Rise up good aunt <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Not yet I thee beseech : For ever will I walk upon my knees And never see day that the happy sees Till thou give joy until thou bid me joy By pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy <eos> DUKE OF AUMERLE : Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Against them both my true joints bended be <eos> Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Pleads he in earnest <eos> look upon his face His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest His words come from his mouth ours from our breast : He prays but faintly and would be denied We pray with heart and soul and all beside : His weary joints would gladly rise I know Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow : His prayers are full of false hypocrisy Ours of true zeal and deep integrity <eos> Our prayers do out-pray his then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Good aunt stand up <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Nay do not say 'stand up' Say 'pardon' first and afterwards 'stand up <eos>' And if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach 'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech <eos> I never long'd to hear a word till now Say 'pardon' king let pity teach thee how : The word is short but not so short as sweet No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet <eos> DUKE OF YORK : Speak it in French king say 'pardonne moi <eos>' DUCHESS OF YORK : Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy <eos> Ah my sour husband my hard-hearted lord That set'st the word itself against the word <eos> Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land The chopping French we do not understand <eos> Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Good aunt stand up <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : I do not sue to stand Pardon is all the suit I have in hand <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I pardon him as God shall pardon me <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : O happy vantage of a kneeling knee <eos> Yet am I sick for fear : speak it again Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain But makes one pardon strong <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : With all my heart I pardon him <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : A god on earth thou art <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot With all the rest of that consorted crew Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels <eos> Good uncle help to order several powers To Oxford or where'er these traitors are : They shall not live within this world I swear But I will have them if I once know where <eos> Uncle farewell : and cousin too adieu : Your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true <eos> DUCHESS OF YORK : Come my old son : I pray God make thee new <eos> EXTON : Didst thou not mark the king what words he spake 'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear <eos>' Was it not so <eos> Servant : These were his very words <eos> EXTON : 'Have I no friend <eos>' quoth he : he spake it twice And urged it twice together did he not <eos> Servant : He did <eos> EXTON : And speaking it he wistly look'd on me And who should say 'I would thou wert the man' That would divorce this terror from my heart' Meaning the king at Pomfret <eos> Come let's go : I am the king's friend and will rid his foe <eos> KING RICHARD II : I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world : And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I cannot do it yet I'll hammer it out <eos> My brain I'll prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of still-breeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented <eos> The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermix'd With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word : As thus 'Come little ones' and then again 'It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a small needle's eye <eos>' Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride <eos> Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortune's slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like <eos> Thus play I in one person many people And none contented : sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am : then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I king'd again : and by and by Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing : but whate'er I be Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased With being nothing <eos> Music do I hear <eos> Ha ha <eos> keep time : how sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept <eos> So is it in the music of men's lives <eos> And here have I the daintiness of ear To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke <eos> I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numbering clock : My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dial's point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears <eos> Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell : so sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours : but my time Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack o' the clock <eos> This music mads me let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad <eos> Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me <eos> For 'tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world <eos> Groom : Hail royal prince <eos> KING RICHARD II : Thanks noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear <eos> What art thou <eos> and how comest thou hither Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live <eos> Groom : I was a poor groom of thy stable king When thou wert king who travelling towards York With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal master's face <eos> O how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld In London streets that coronation-day When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary That horse that thou so often hast bestrid That horse that I so carefully have dress'd <eos> KING RICHARD II : Rode he on Barbary <eos> Tell me gentle friend How went he under him <eos> Groom : So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground <eos> KING RICHARD II : So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back <eos> That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him <eos> Would he not stumble <eos> would he not fall down Since pride must have a fall and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp his back <eos> Forgiveness horse <eos> why do I rail on thee Since thou created to be awed by man Wast born to bear <eos> I was not made a horse And yet I bear a burthen like an ass Spurr'd gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke <eos> Keeper : Fellow give place here is no longer stay <eos> KING RICHARD II : If thou love me 'tis time thou wert away <eos> Groom : What my tongue dares not that my heart shall say <eos> Keeper : My lord will't please you to fall to <eos> KING RICHARD II : Taste of it first as thou art wont to do <eos> Keeper : My lord I dare not : Sir Pierce of Exton who lately came from the king commands the contrary <eos> KING RICHARD II : The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee <eos> Patience is stale and I am weary of it <eos> Keeper : Help help help <eos> KING RICHARD II : How now <eos> what means death in this rude assault <eos> Villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument <eos> Go thou and fill another room in hell <eos> That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire That staggers thus my person <eos> Exton thy fierce hand Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land <eos> Mount mount my soul <eos> thy seat is up on high Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die <eos> EXTON : As full of valour as of royal blood : Both have I spill'd O would the deed were good <eos> For now the devil that told me I did well Says that this deed is chronicled in hell <eos> This dead king to the living king I'll bear Take hence the rest and give them burial here <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Kind uncle York the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have consumed with fire Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not <eos> Welcome my lord what is the news <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : First to thy sacred state wish I all happiness <eos> The next news is I have to London sent The heads of Oxford Salisbury Blunt and Kent : The manner of their taking may appear At large discoursed in this paper here <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : We thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains And to thy worth will add right worthy gains <eos> LORD FITZWATER : My lord I have from Oxford sent to London The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely Two of the dangerous consorted traitors That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot Right noble is thy merit well I wot <eos> HENRY PERCY : The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster With clog of conscience and sour melancholy Hath yielded up his body to the grave But here is Carlisle living to abide Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Carlisle this is your doom : Choose out some secret place some reverend room More than thou hast and with it joy thy life So as thou livest in peace die free from strife : For though mine enemy thou hast ever been High sparks of honour in thee have I seen <eos> EXTON : Great king within this coffin I present Thy buried fear : herein all breathless lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous land <eos> EXTON : From your own mouth my lord did I this deed <eos> HENRY BOLINGBROKE : They love not poison that do poison need Nor do I thee : though I did wish him dead I hate the murderer love him murdered <eos> The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour But neither my good word nor princely favour : With Cain go wander through shades of night And never show thy head by day nor light <eos> Lords I protest my soul is full of woe That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow : Come mourn with me for that I do lament And put on sullen black incontinent : I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land To wash this blood off from my guilty hand : March sadly after grace my mournings here In weeping after this untimely bier <eos> SAMPSON : Gregory o' my word we'll not carry coals <eos> GREGORY : No for then we should be colliers <eos> SAMPSON : I mean an we be in choler we'll draw <eos> GREGORY : Ay while you live draw your neck out o' the collar <eos> SAMPSON : I strike quickly being moved <eos> GREGORY : But thou art not quickly moved to strike <eos> SAMPSON : A dog of the house of Montague moves me <eos> GREGORY : To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand : therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st away <eos> SAMPSON : A dog of that house shall move me to stand : I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's <eos> GREGORY : That shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes to the wall <eos> SAMPSON : True and therefore women being the weaker vessels are ever thrust to the wall : therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall <eos> GREGORY : The quarrel is between our masters and us their men <eos> SAMPSON : 'Tis all one I will show myself a tyrant : when I have fought with the men I will be cruel with the maids and cut off their heads <eos> GREGORY : The heads of the maids <eos> SAMPSON : Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads take it in what sense thou wilt <eos> GREGORY : They must take it in sense that feel it <eos> SAMPSON : Me they shall feel while I am able to stand : and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh <eos> GREGORY : 'Tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou hadst been poor John <eos> Draw thy tool <eos> here comes two of the house of the Montagues <eos> SAMPSON : My naked weapon is out : quarrel I will back thee <eos> GREGORY : How <eos> turn thy back and run <eos> SAMPSON : Fear me not <eos> GREGORY : No marry I fear thee <eos> SAMPSON : Let us take the law of our sides let them begin <eos> GREGORY : I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as they list <eos> SAMPSON : Nay as they dare <eos> I will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them if they bear it <eos> ABRAHAM : Do you bite your thumb at us sir <eos> SAMPSON : I do bite my thumb sir <eos> ABRAHAM : Do you bite your thumb at us sir <eos> SAMPSON : GREGORY : No <eos> SAMPSON : No sir I do not bite my thumb at you sir but I bite my thumb sir <eos> GREGORY : Do you quarrel sir <eos> ABRAHAM : Quarrel sir <eos> no sir <eos> SAMPSON : If you do sir I am for you : I serve as good a man as you <eos> ABRAHAM : No better <eos> SAMPSON : Well sir <eos> GREGORY : Say 'better :' here comes one of my master's kinsmen <eos> SAMPSON : Yes better sir <eos> ABRAHAM : You lie <eos> SAMPSON : Draw if you be men <eos> Gregory remember thy swashing blow <eos> BENVOLIO : Part fools <eos> Put up your swords you know not what you do <eos> TYBALT : What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds <eos> Turn thee Benvolio look upon thy death <eos> BENVOLIO : I do but keep the peace : put up thy sword Or manage it to part these men with me <eos> TYBALT : What drawn and talk of peace <eos> I hate the word As I hate hell all Montagues and thee : Have at thee coward <eos> First Citizen : Clubs bills and partisans <eos> strike <eos> beat them down <eos> Down with the Capulets <eos> down with the Montagues <eos> CAPULET : What noise is this <eos> Give me my long sword ho <eos> LADY CAPULET : A crutch a crutch <eos> why call you for a sword <eos> CAPULET : My sword I say <eos> Old Montague is come And flourishes his blade in spite of me <eos> MONTAGUE : Thou villain Capulet <eos>Hold me not let me go <eos> LADY MONTAGUE : Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe <eos> PRINCE : Rebellious subjects enemies to peace Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel <eos> Will they not hear <eos> What ho <eos> you men you beasts That quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins On pain of torture from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground And hear the sentence of your moved prince <eos> Three civil brawls bred of an airy word By thee old Capulet and Montague Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets And made Verona's ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments To wield old partisans in hands as old Canker'd with peace to part your canker'd hate : If ever you disturb our streets again Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace <eos> For this time all the rest depart away : You Capulet shall go along with me : And Montague come you this afternoon To know our further pleasure in this case To old Free-town our common judgment-place <eos> Once more on pain of death all men depart <eos> MONTAGUE : Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach <eos> Speak nephew were you by when it began <eos> BENVOLIO : Here were the servants of your adversary And yours close fighting ere I did approach : I drew to part them : in the instant came The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared Which as he breathed defiance to my ears He swung about his head and cut the winds Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn : While we were interchanging thrusts and blows Came more and more and fought on part and part Till the prince came who parted either part <eos> LADY MONTAGUE : O where is Romeo <eos> saw you him to-day <eos> Right glad I am he was not at this fray <eos> BENVOLIO : Madam an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad Where underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city's side So early walking did I see your son : Towards him I made but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood : I measuring his affections by my own That most are busied when they're most alone Pursued my humour not pursuing his And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me <eos> MONTAGUE : Many a morning hath he there been seen With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew <eos> Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed Away from the light steals home my heavy son And private in his chamber pens himself Shuts up his windows locks far daylight out And makes himself an artificial night : Black and portentous must this humour prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove <eos> BENVOLIO : My noble uncle do you know the cause <eos> MONTAGUE : I neither know it nor can learn of him <eos> BENVOLIO : Have you importuned him by any means <eos> MONTAGUE : Both by myself and many other friends : But he his own affections' counsellor Is to himself <eos>I will not say how true <eos> But to himself so secret and so close So far from sounding and discovery As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air Or dedicate his beauty to the sun <eos> Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow <eos> We would as willingly give cure as know <eos> BENVOLIO : See where he comes : so please you step aside I'll know his grievance or be much denied <eos> MONTAGUE : I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift <eos> Come madam let's away <eos> BENVOLIO : Good-morrow cousin <eos> ROMEO : Is the day so young <eos> BENVOLIO : But new struck nine <eos> ROMEO : Ay me <eos> sad hours seem long <eos> Was that my father that went hence so fast <eos> BENVOLIO : It was <eos> What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours <eos> ROMEO : Not having that which having makes them short <eos> BENVOLIO : In love <eos> ROMEO : Out <eos> BENVOLIO : Of love <eos> ROMEO : Out of her favour where I am in love <eos> BENVOLIO : Alas that love so gentle in his view Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof <eos> ROMEO : Alas that love whose view is muffled still Should without eyes see pathways to his will <eos> Where shall we dine <eos> O me <eos> What fray was here <eos> Yet tell me not for I have heard it all <eos> Here's much to do with hate but more with love <eos> Why then O brawling love <eos> O loving hate <eos> O any thing of nothing first create <eos> O heavy lightness <eos> serious vanity <eos> Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms <eos> Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health <eos> Still-waking sleep that is not what it is <eos> This love feel I that feel no love in this <eos> Dost thou not laugh <eos> BENVOLIO : No coz I rather weep <eos> ROMEO : Good heart at what <eos> BENVOLIO : At thy good heart's oppression <eos> ROMEO : Why such is love's transgression <eos> Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest With more of thine : this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own <eos> Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs Being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears : What is it else <eos> a madness most discreet A choking gall and a preserving sweet <eos> Farewell my coz <eos> BENVOLIO : Soft <eos> I will go along An if you leave me so you do me wrong <eos> ROMEO : Tut I have lost myself I am not here This is not Romeo he's some other where <eos> BENVOLIO : Tell me in sadness who is that you love <eos> ROMEO : What shall I groan and tell thee <eos> BENVOLIO : Groan <eos> why no <eos> But sadly tell me who <eos> ROMEO : Bid a sick man in sadness make his will : Ah word ill urged to one that is so ill <eos> In sadness cousin I do love a woman <eos> BENVOLIO : I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved <eos> ROMEO : A right good mark-man <eos> And she's fair I love <eos> BENVOLIO : A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit <eos> ROMEO : Well in that hit you miss : she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow she hath Dian's wit And in strong proof of chastity well arm'd From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd <eos> She will not stay the siege of loving terms Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold : O she is rich in beauty only poor That when she dies with beauty dies her store <eos> BENVOLIO : Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste <eos> ROMEO : She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste For beauty starved with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity <eos> She is too fair too wise wisely too fair To merit bliss by making me despair : She hath forsworn to love and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now <eos> BENVOLIO : Be ruled by me forget to think of her <eos> ROMEO : O teach me how I should forget to think <eos> BENVOLIO : By giving liberty unto thine eyes Examine other beauties <eos> ROMEO : 'Tis the way To call hers exquisite in question more : These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows Being black put us in mind they hide the fair He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost : Show me a mistress that is passing fair What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair <eos> Farewell : thou canst not teach me to forget <eos> BENVOLIO : I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt <eos> CAPULET : But Montague is bound as well as I In penalty alike and 'tis not hard I think For men so old as we to keep the peace <eos> PARIS : Of honourable reckoning are you both And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long <eos> But now my lord what say you to my suit <eos> CAPULET : But saying o'er what I have said before : My child is yet a stranger in the world She hath not seen the change of fourteen years Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride <eos> PARIS : Younger than she are happy mothers made <eos> CAPULET : And too soon marr'd are those so early made <eos> The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she She is the hopeful lady of my earth : But woo her gentle Paris get her heart My will to her consent is but a part An she agree within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice <eos> This night I hold an old accustom'd feast Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love and you among the store One more most welcome makes my number more <eos> At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light : Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-apparell'd April on the heel Of limping winter treads even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house hear all all see And like her most whose merit most shall be : Which on more view of many mine being one May stand in number though in reckoning none Come go with me <eos> Go sirrah trudge about Through fair Verona find those persons out Whose names are written there and to them say My house and welcome on their pleasure stay <eos> Servant : Find them out whose names are written here <eos> It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ <eos> I must to the learned <eos> <eos>In good time <eos> BENVOLIO : Tut man one fire burns out another's burning One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning One desperate grief cures with another's languish : Take thou some new infection to thy eye And the rank poison of the old will die <eos> ROMEO : Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that <eos> BENVOLIO : For what I pray thee <eos> ROMEO : For your broken shin <eos> BENVOLIO : Why Romeo art thou mad <eos> ROMEO : Not mad but bound more than a mad-man is Shut up in prison kept without my food Whipp'd and tormented and <eos>God-den good fellow <eos> Servant : God gi' god-den <eos> I pray sir can you read <eos> ROMEO : Ay mine own fortune in my misery <eos> Servant : Perhaps you have learned it without book : but I pray can you read any thing you see <eos> ROMEO : Ay if I know the letters and the language <eos> Servant : Ye say honestly : rest you merry <eos> ROMEO : Stay fellow I can read <eos> 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters County Anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of Vitravio Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine mine uncle Capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece Rosaline Livia Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena <eos>' A fair assembly : whither should they come <eos> Servant : Up <eos> ROMEO : Whither <eos> Servant : To supper to our house <eos> ROMEO : Whose house <eos> Servant : My master's <eos> ROMEO : Indeed I should have ask'd you that before <eos> Servant : Now I'll tell you without asking : my master is the great rich Capulet and if you be not of the house of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine <eos> Rest you merry <eos> BENVOLIO : At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest With all the admired beauties of Verona : Go thither and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show And I will make thee think thy swan a crow <eos> ROMEO : When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires And these who often drown'd could never die Transparent heretics be burnt for liars <eos> One fairer than my love <eos> the all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun <eos> BENVOLIO : Tut you saw her fair none else being by Herself poised with herself in either eye : But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd Your lady's love against some other maid That I will show you shining at this feast And she shall scant show well that now shows best <eos> ROMEO : I'll go along no such sight to be shown But to rejoice in splendor of mine own <eos> LADY CAPULET : Nurse where's my daughter <eos> call her forth to me <eos> Nurse : Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come <eos> What lamb <eos> what ladybird <eos> God forbid <eos> Where's this girl <eos> What Juliet <eos> JULIET : How now <eos> who calls <eos> Nurse : Your mother <eos> JULIET : Madam I am here <eos> What is your will <eos> LADY CAPULET : This is the matter : <eos>Nurse give leave awhile We must talk in secret : <eos>nurse come back again I have remember'd me thou's hear our counsel <eos> Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age <eos> Nurse : Faith I can tell her age unto an hour <eos> LADY CAPULET : She's not fourteen <eos> Nurse : I'll lay fourteen of my teeth <eos> And yet to my teeth be it spoken I have but four <eos> She is not fourteen <eos> How long is it now To Lammas-tide <eos> LADY CAPULET : A fortnight and odd days <eos> Nurse : Even or odd of all days in the year Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen <eos> Susan and she <eos>God rest all Christian souls <eos> <eos> Were of an age : well Susan is with God She was too good for me : but as I said On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen That shall she marry I remember it well <eos> 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years And she was wean'd <eos>I never shall forget it <eos> Of all the days of the year upon that day : For I had then laid wormwood to my dug Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall My lord and you were then at Mantua : <eos> Nay I do bear a brain : <eos>but as I said When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug <eos> Shake quoth the dove-house : 'twas no need I trow To bid me trudge : And since that time it is eleven years For then she could stand alone nay by the rood She could have run and waddled all about For even the day before she broke her brow : And then my husband <eos>God be with his soul <eos> A' was a merry man <eos>took up the child : 'Yea' quoth he 'dost thou fall upon thy face <eos> Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit Wilt thou not Jule <eos>' and by my holidame The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay <eos>' To see now how a jest shall come about <eos> I warrant an I should live a thousand years I never should forget it : 'Wilt thou not Jule <eos>' quoth he And pretty fool it stinted and said 'Ay <eos>' LADY CAPULET : Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace <eos> Nurse : Yes madam : yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay <eos>' And yet I warrant it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone A parlous knock and it cried bitterly : 'Yea' quoth my husband'fall'st upon thy face <eos> Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age Wilt thou not Jule <eos>' it stinted and said 'Ay <eos>' JULIET : And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I <eos> Nurse : Peace I have done <eos> God mark thee to his grace <eos> Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed : An I might live to see thee married once I have my wish <eos> LADY CAPULET : Marry that 'marry' is the very theme I came to talk of <eos> Tell me daughter Juliet How stands your disposition to be married <eos> JULIET : It is an honour that I dream not of <eos> Nurse : An honour <eos> were not I thine only nurse I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat <eos> LADY CAPULET : Well think of marriage now younger than you Here in Verona ladies of esteem Are made already mothers : by my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid <eos> Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love <eos> Nurse : A man young lady <eos> lady such a man As all the world <eos>why he's a man of wax <eos> LADY CAPULET : Verona's summer hath not such a flower <eos> Nurse : Nay he's a flower in faith a very flower <eos> LADY CAPULET : What say you <eos> can you love the gentleman <eos> This night you shall behold him at our feast Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face And find delight writ there with beauty's pen Examine every married lineament And see how one another lends content And what obscured in this fair volume lies Find written in the margent of his eyes <eos> This precious book of love this unbound lover To beautify him only lacks a cover : The fish lives in the sea and 'tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide : That book in many's eyes doth share the glory That in gold clasps locks in the golden story So shall you share all that he doth possess By having him making yourself no less <eos> Nurse : No less <eos> nay bigger women grow by men <eos> LADY CAPULET : Speak briefly can you like of Paris' love <eos> JULIET : I'll look to like if looking liking move : But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly <eos> Servant : Madam the guests are come supper served up you called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in the pantry and every thing in extremity <eos> I must hence to wait I beseech you follow straight <eos> LADY CAPULET : We follow thee <eos> Juliet the county stays <eos> Nurse : Go girl seek happy nights to happy days <eos> ROMEO : What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse <eos> Or shall we on without a apology <eos> BENVOLIO : The date is out of such prolixity : We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper Nor no without-book prologue faintly spoke After the prompter for our entrance : But let them measure us by what they will We'll measure them a measure and be gone <eos> ROMEO : Give me a torch : I am not for this ambling Being but heavy I will bear the light <eos> MERCUTIO : Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance <eos> ROMEO : Not I believe me : you have dancing shoes With nimble soles : I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move <eos> MERCUTIO : You are a lover borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound <eos> ROMEO : I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe : Under love's heavy burden do I sink <eos> MERCUTIO : And to sink in it should you burden love Too great oppression for a tender thing <eos> ROMEO : Is love a tender thing <eos> it is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn <eos> MERCUTIO : If love be rough with you be rough with love Prick love for pricking and you beat love down <eos> Give me a case to put my visage in : A visor for a visor <eos> what care I What curious eye doth quote deformities <eos> Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me <eos> BENVOLIO : Come knock and enter and no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs <eos> ROMEO : A torch for me : let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase I'll be a candle-holder and look on <eos> The game was ne'er so fair and I am done <eos> MERCUTIO : Tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word : If thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire Of this sir-reverence love wherein thou stick'st Up to the ears <eos> Come we burn daylight ho <eos> ROMEO : Nay that's not so <eos> MERCUTIO : I mean sir in delay We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day <eos> Take our good meaning for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits <eos> ROMEO : And we mean well in going to this mask But 'tis no wit to go <eos> MERCUTIO : Why may one ask <eos> ROMEO : I dream'd a dream to-night <eos> MERCUTIO : And so did I <eos> ROMEO : Well what was yours <eos> MERCUTIO : That dreamers often lie <eos> ROMEO : In bed asleep while they do dream things true <eos> MERCUTIO : O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you <eos> She is the fairies' midwife and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs The cover of the wings of grasshoppers The traces of the smallest spider's web The collars of the moonshine's watery beams Her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat Not so big as a round little worm Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers <eos> And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains and then they dream of love O'er courtiers' knees that dream on court'sies straight O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees O'er ladies ' lips who straight on kisses dream Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are : Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep Then dreams he of another benefice : Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades Of healths five-fathom deep and then anon Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again <eos> This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs Which once untangled much misfortune bodes : This is the hag when maids lie on their backs That presses them and learns them first to bear Making them women of good carriage : This is she <eos> ROMEO : Peace peace Mercutio peace <eos> Thou talk'st of nothing <eos> MERCUTIO : True I talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Begot of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north And being anger'd puffs away from thence Turning his face to the dew-dropping south <eos> BENVOLIO : This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves Supper is done and we shall come too late <eos> ROMEO : I fear too early : for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death <eos> But He that hath the steerage of my course Direct my sail <eos> On lusty gentlemen <eos> BENVOLIO : Strike drum <eos> First Servant : Where's Potpan that he helps not to take away <eos> He shift a trencher <eos> he scrape a trencher <eos> Second Servant : When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands and they unwashed too 'tis a foul thing <eos> First Servant : Away with the joint-stools remove the court-cupboard look to the plate <eos> Good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell <eos> Antony and Potpan <eos> Second Servant : Ay boy ready <eos> First Servant : You are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber <eos> Second Servant : We cannot be here and there too <eos> Cheerly boys be brisk awhile and the longer liver take all <eos> CAPULET : Welcome gentlemen <eos> ladies that have their toes Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you <eos> Ah ha my mistresses <eos> which of you all Will now deny to dance <eos> she that makes dainty She I'll swear hath corns am I come near ye now <eos> Welcome gentlemen <eos> I have seen the day That I have worn a visor and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear Such as would please : 'tis gone 'tis gone 'tis gone : You are welcome gentlemen <eos> come musicians play <eos> A hall a hall <eos> give room <eos> and foot it girls <eos> More light you knaves and turn the tables up And quench the fire the room is grown too hot <eos> Ah sirrah this unlook'd-for sport comes well <eos> Nay sit nay sit good cousin Capulet For you and I are past our dancing days : How long is't now since last yourself and I Were in a mask <eos> Second Capulet : By'r lady thirty years <eos> CAPULET : What man <eos> 'tis not so much 'tis not so much : 'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio Come pentecost as quickly as it will Some five and twenty years and then we mask'd <eos> Second Capulet : 'Tis more 'tis more his son is elder sir His son is thirty <eos> CAPULET : Will you tell me that <eos> His son was but a ward two years ago <eos> ROMEO : Servant : I know not sir <eos> ROMEO : O she doth teach the torches to burn bright <eos> It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear <eos> So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows <eos> The measure done I'll watch her place of stand And touching hers make blessed my rude hand <eos> Did my heart love till now <eos> forswear it sight <eos> For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night <eos> TYBALT : This by his voice should be a Montague <eos> Fetch me my rapier boy <eos> What dares the slave Come hither cover'd with an antic face To fleer and scorn at our solemnity <eos> Now by the stock and honour of my kin To strike him dead I hold it not a sin <eos> CAPULET : Why how now kinsman <eos> wherefore storm you so <eos> TYBALT : Uncle this is a Montague our foe A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night <eos> CAPULET : Young Romeo is it <eos> TYBALT : 'Tis he that villain Romeo <eos> CAPULET : Content thee gentle coz let him alone He bears him like a portly gentleman And to say truth Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth : I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement : Therefore be patient take no note of him : It is my will the which if thou respect Show a fair presence and put off these frowns And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast <eos> TYBALT : It fits when such a villain is a guest : I'll not endure him <eos> CAPULET : He shall be endured : What goodman boy <eos> I say he shall : go to Am I the master here or you <eos> go to <eos> You'll not endure him <eos> God shall mend my soul <eos> You'll make a mutiny among my guests <eos> You will set cock-a-hoop <eos> you'll be the man <eos> TYBALT : Why uncle 'tis a shame <eos> CAPULET : Go to go to You are a saucy boy : is't so indeed <eos> This trick may chance to scathe you I know what : You must contrary me <eos> marry 'tis time <eos> Well said my hearts <eos> You are a princox go : Be quiet or <eos>More light more light <eos> For shame <eos> I'll make you quiet <eos> What cheerly my hearts <eos> TYBALT : Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting <eos> I will withdraw : but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall <eos> ROMEO : JULIET : Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much Which mannerly devotion shows in this For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss <eos> ROMEO : Have not saints lips and holy palmers too <eos> JULIET : Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer <eos> ROMEO : O then dear saint let lips do what hands do They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair <eos> JULIET : Saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake <eos> ROMEO : Then move not while my prayer's effect I take <eos> Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged <eos> JULIET : Then have my lips the sin that they have took <eos> ROMEO : Sin from thy lips <eos> O trespass sweetly urged <eos> Give me my sin again <eos> JULIET : You kiss by the book <eos> Nurse : Madam your mother craves a word with you <eos> ROMEO : What is her mother <eos> Nurse : Marry bachelor Her mother is the lady of the house And a good lady and a wise and virtuous I nursed her daughter that you talk'd withal I tell you he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks <eos> ROMEO : Is she a Capulet <eos> O dear account <eos> my life is my foe's debt <eos> BENVOLIO : Away begone the sport is at the best <eos> ROMEO : Ay so I fear the more is my unrest <eos> CAPULET : Nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone We have a trifling foolish banquet towards <eos> Is it e'en so <eos> why then I thank you all I thank you honest gentlemen good night <eos> More torches here <eos> Come on then let's to bed <eos> Ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late : I'll to my rest <eos> JULIET : Come hither nurse <eos> What is yond gentleman <eos> Nurse : The son and heir of old Tiberio <eos> JULIET : What's he that now is going out of door <eos> Nurse : Marry that I think be young Petrucio <eos> JULIET : What's he that follows there that would not dance <eos> Nurse : I know not <eos> JULIET : Go ask his name : if he be married <eos> My grave is like to be my wedding bed <eos> Nurse : His name is Romeo and a Montague The only son of your great enemy <eos> JULIET : My only love sprung from my only hate <eos> Too early seen unknown and known too late <eos> Prodigious birth of love it is to me That I must love a loathed enemy <eos> Nurse : What's this <eos> what's this <eos> JULIET : A rhyme I learn'd even now Of one I danced withal <eos> Nurse : Anon anon <eos> Come let's away the strangers all are gone <eos> Chorus : Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie And young affection gapes to be his heir That fair for which love groan'd for and would die With tender Juliet match'd is now not fair <eos> Now Romeo is beloved and loves again Alike betwitched by the charm of looks But to his foe supposed he must complain And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks : Being held a foe he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear And she as much in love her means much less To meet her new-beloved any where : But passion lends them power time means to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet <eos> ROMEO : Can I go forward when my heart is here <eos> Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out <eos> BENVOLIO : Romeo <eos> my cousin Romeo <eos> MERCUTIO : He is wise And on my lie hath stol'n him home to bed <eos> BENVOLIO : He ran this way and leap'd this orchard wall : Call good Mercutio <eos> MERCUTIO : Nay I'll conjure too <eos> Romeo <eos> humours <eos> madman <eos> passion <eos> lover <eos> Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh : Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied Cry but 'Ay me <eos>' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove' Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word One nick-name for her purblind son and heir Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid <eos> He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not The ape is dead and I must conjure him <eos> I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes By her high forehead and her scarlet lip By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh And the demesnes that there adjacent lie That in thy likeness thou appear to us <eos> BENVOLIO : And if he hear thee thou wilt anger him <eos> MERCUTIO : This cannot anger him : 'twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle Of some strange nature letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjured it down That were some spite : my invocation Is fair and honest and in his mistress' name I conjure only but to raise up him <eos> BENVOLIO : Come he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night : Blind is his love and best befits the dark <eos> MERCUTIO : If love be blind love cannot hit the mark <eos> Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone <eos> Romeo that she were O that she were An open et caetera thou a poperin pear <eos> Romeo good night : I'll to my truckle-bed This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep : Come shall we go <eos> BENVOLIO : Go then for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found <eos> ROMEO : He jests at scars that never felt a wound <eos> But soft <eos> what light through yonder window breaks <eos> It is the east and Juliet is the sun <eos> Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she : Be not her maid since she is envious Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it cast it off <eos> It is my lady O it is my love <eos> O that she knew she were <eos> She speaks yet she says nothing : what of that <eos> Her eye discourses I will answer it <eos> I am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks : Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return <eos> What if her eyes were there they in her head <eos> The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night <eos> See how she leans her cheek upon her hand <eos> O that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek <eos> JULIET : Ay me <eos> ROMEO : She speaks : O speak again bright angel <eos> for thou art As glorious to this night being o'er my head As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air <eos> JULIET : O Romeo Romeo <eos> wherefore art thou Romeo <eos> Deny thy father and refuse thy name Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love And I'll no longer be a Capulet <eos> ROMEO : JULIET : 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy Thou art thyself though not a Montague <eos> What's Montague <eos> it is nor hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man <eos> O be some other name <eos> What's in a name <eos> that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet So Romeo would were he not Romeo call'd Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title <eos> Romeo doff thy name And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself <eos> ROMEO : I take thee at thy word : Call me but love and I'll be new baptized Henceforth I never will be Romeo <eos> JULIET : What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my counsel <eos> ROMEO : By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am : My name dear saint is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee Had I it written I would tear the word <eos> JULIET : My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue's utterance yet I know the sound : Art thou not Romeo and a Montague <eos> ROMEO : Neither fair saint if either thee dislike <eos> JULIET : How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore <eos> The orchard walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art If any of my kinsmen find thee here <eos> ROMEO : With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls For stony limits cannot hold love out And what love can do that dares love attempt Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me <eos> JULIET : If they do see thee they will murder thee <eos> ROMEO : Alack there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords : look thou but sweet And I am proof against their enmity <eos> JULIET : I would not for the world they saw thee here <eos> ROMEO : I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight And but thou love me let them find me here : My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued wanting of thy love <eos> JULIET : By whose direction found'st thou out this place <eos> ROMEO : By love who first did prompt me to inquire He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes <eos> I am no pilot yet wert thou as far As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea I would adventure for such merchandise <eos> JULIET : Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny What I have spoke : but farewell compliment <eos> Dost thou love me <eos> I know thou wilt say 'Ay' And I will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st Thou mayst prove false at lovers' perjuries Then say Jove laughs <eos> O gentle Romeo If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully : Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay So thou wilt woo but else not for the world <eos> In truth fair Montague I am too fond And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light : But trust me gentleman I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange <eos> I should have been more strange I must confess But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware My true love's passion : therefore pardon me And not impute this yielding to light love Which the dark night hath so discovered <eos> ROMEO : Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops <eos> JULIET : O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon That monthly changes in her circled orb Lest that thy love prove likewise variable <eos> ROMEO : What shall I swear by <eos> JULIET : Do not swear at all Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self Which is the god of my idolatry And I'll believe thee <eos> ROMEO : If my heart's dear love <eos> JULIET : Well do not swear : although I joy in thee I have no joy of this contract to-night : It is too rash too unadvised too sudden Too like the lightning which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens <eos>' Sweet good night <eos> This bud of love by summer's ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet <eos> Good night good night <eos> as sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast <eos> ROMEO : O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied <eos> JULIET : What satisfaction canst thou have to-night <eos> ROMEO : The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine <eos> JULIET : I gave thee mine before thou didst request it : And yet I would it were to give again <eos> ROMEO : Wouldst thou withdraw it <eos> for what purpose love <eos> JULIET : But to be frank and give it thee again <eos> And yet I wish but for the thing I have : My bounty is as boundless as the sea My love as deep the more I give to thee The more I have for both are infinite <eos> I hear some noise within dear love adieu <eos> Anon good nurse <eos> Sweet Montague be true <eos> Stay but a little I will come again <eos> ROMEO : O blessed blessed night <eos> I am afeard <eos> Being in night all this is but a dream Too flattering-sweet to be substantial <eos> JULIET : Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed <eos> If that thy bent of love be honourable Thy purpose marriage send me word to-morrow By one that I'll procure to come to thee Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world <eos> Nurse : JULIET : I come anon <eos> <eos>But if thou mean'st not well I do beseech thee <eos> Nurse : JULIET : By and by I come : <eos> To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief : To-morrow will I send <eos> ROMEO : So thrive my soul <eos> JULIET : A thousand times good night <eos> ROMEO : A thousand times the worse to want thy light <eos> Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books But love from love toward school with heavy looks <eos> JULIET : Hist <eos> Romeo hist <eos> O for a falconer's voice To lure this tassel-gentle back again <eos> Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of my Romeo's name <eos> ROMEO : It is my soul that calls upon my name : How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night Like softest music to attending ears <eos> JULIET : Romeo <eos> ROMEO : My dear <eos> JULIET : At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee <eos> ROMEO : At the hour of nine <eos> JULIET : I will not fail : 'tis twenty years till then <eos> I have forgot why I did call thee back <eos> ROMEO : Let me stand here till thou remember it <eos> JULIET : I shall forget to have thee still stand there Remembering how I love thy company <eos> ROMEO : And I'll still stay to have thee still forget Forgetting any other home but this <eos> JULIET : 'Tis almost morning I would have thee gone : And yet no further than a wanton's bird Who lets it hop a little from her hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves And with a silk thread plucks it back again So loving-jealous of his liberty <eos> ROMEO : I would I were thy bird <eos> JULIET : Sweet so would I : Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing <eos> Good night good night <eos> parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow <eos> ROMEO : Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast <eos> Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest <eos> Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell His help to crave and my dear hap to tell <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels : Now ere the sun advance his burning eye The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry I must up-fill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers <eos> The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb What is her burying grave that is her womb And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find Many for many virtues excellent None but for some and yet all different <eos> O mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs plants stones and their true qualities : For nought so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse : Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied And vice sometimes by action dignified <eos> Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power : For this being smelt with that part cheers each part Being tasted slays all senses with the heart <eos> Two such opposed kings encamp them still In man as well as herbs grace and rude will And where the worser is predominant Full soon the canker death eats up that plant <eos> ROMEO : Good morrow father <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Benedicite <eos> What early tongue so sweet saluteth me <eos> Young son it argues a distemper'd head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed : Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye And where care lodges sleep will never lie But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign : Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art up-roused by some distemperature Or if not so then here I hit it right Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night <eos> ROMEO : That last is true the sweeter rest was mine <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : God pardon sin <eos> wast thou with Rosaline <eos> ROMEO : With Rosaline my ghostly father <eos> no I have forgot that name and that name's woe <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : That's my good son : but where hast thou been then <eos> ROMEO : I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again <eos> I have been feasting with mine enemy Where on a sudden one hath wounded me That's by me wounded : both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies : I bear no hatred blessed man for lo My intercession likewise steads my foe <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Be plain good son and homely in thy drift Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift <eos> ROMEO : Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet : As mine on hers so hers is set on mine And all combined save what thou must combine By holy marriage : when and where and how We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow I'll tell thee as we pass but this I pray That thou consent to marry us to-day <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Holy Saint Francis what a change is here <eos> Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear So soon forsaken <eos> young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes <eos> Jesu Maria what a deal of brine Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline <eos> How much salt water thrown away in waste To season love that of it doth not taste <eos> The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet : If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline : And art thou changed <eos> pronounce this sentence then Women may fall when there's no strength in men <eos> ROMEO : Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : For doting not for loving pupil mine <eos> ROMEO : And bad'st me bury love <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Not in a grave To lay one in another out to have <eos> ROMEO : I pray thee chide not she whom I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow The other did not so <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : O she knew well Thy love did read by rote and could not spell <eos> But come young waverer come go with me In one respect I'll thy assistant be For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households' rancour to pure love <eos> ROMEO : O let us hence I stand on sudden haste <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast <eos> MERCUTIO : Where the devil should this Romeo be <eos> Came he not home to-night <eos> BENVOLIO : Not to his father's I spoke with his man <eos> MERCUTIO : Ah that same pale hard-hearted wench that Rosaline <eos> Torments him so that he will sure run mad <eos> BENVOLIO : Tybalt the kinsman of old Capulet Hath sent a letter to his father's house <eos> MERCUTIO : A challenge on my life <eos> BENVOLIO : Romeo will answer it <eos> MERCUTIO : Any man that can write may answer a letter <eos> BENVOLIO : Nay he will answer the letter's master how he dares being dared <eos> MERCUTIO : Alas poor Romeo <eos> he is already dead stabbed with a white wench's black eye shot through the ear with a love-song the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft : and is he a man to encounter Tybalt <eos> BENVOLIO : Why what is Tybalt <eos> MERCUTIO : More than prince of cats I can tell you <eos> O he is the courageous captain of compliments <eos> He fights as you sing prick-song keeps time distance and proportion rests me his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause : ah the immortal passado <eos> the punto reverso <eos> the hai <eos> BENVOLIO : The what <eos> MERCUTIO : The pox of such antic lisping affecting fantasticoes these new tuners of accents <eos> 'By Jesu a very good blade <eos> a very tall man <eos> a very good whore <eos>' Why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies these fashion-mongers these perdona-mi's who stand so much on the new form that they cannot at ease on the old bench <eos> O their bones their bones <eos> BENVOLIO : Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo <eos> MERCUTIO : Without his roe like a dried herring : flesh flesh how art thou fishified <eos> Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in : Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench marry she had a better love to be-rhyme her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gipsy Helen and Hero hildings and harlots Thisbe a grey eye or so but not to the purpose <eos> Signior Romeo bon jour <eos> there's a French salutation to your French slop <eos> You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night <eos> ROMEO : Good morrow to you both <eos> What counterfeit did I give you <eos> MERCUTIO : The ship sir the slip can you not conceive <eos> ROMEO : Pardon good Mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy <eos> MERCUTIO : That's as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams <eos> ROMEO : Meaning to court'sy <eos> MERCUTIO : Thou hast most kindly hit it <eos> ROMEO : A most courteous exposition <eos> MERCUTIO : Nay I am the very pink of courtesy <eos> ROMEO : Pink for flower <eos> MERCUTIO : Right <eos> ROMEO : Why then is my pump well flowered <eos> MERCUTIO : Well said : follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular <eos> ROMEO : O single-soled jest solely singular for the singleness <eos> MERCUTIO : Come between us good Benvolio my wits faint <eos> ROMEO : Switch and spurs switch and spurs or I'll cry a match <eos> MERCUTIO : Nay if thy wits run the wild-goose chase I have done for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five : was I with you there for the goose <eos> ROMEO : Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast not there for the goose <eos> MERCUTIO : I will bite thee by the ear for that jest <eos> ROMEO : Nay good goose bite not <eos> MERCUTIO : Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce <eos> ROMEO : And is it not well served in to a sweet goose <eos> MERCUTIO : O here's a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad <eos> ROMEO : I stretch it out for that word 'broad' which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose <eos> MERCUTIO : Why is not this better now than groaning for love <eos> now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature : for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole <eos> BENVOLIO : Stop there stop there <eos> MERCUTIO : Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair <eos> BENVOLIO : Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large <eos> MERCUTIO : O thou art deceived I would have made it short : for I was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer <eos> ROMEO : Here's goodly gear <eos> MERCUTIO : A sail a sail <eos> BENVOLIO : Two two a shirt and a smock <eos> Nurse : Peter <eos> PETER : Anon <eos> Nurse : My fan Peter <eos> MERCUTIO : Good Peter to hide her face for her fan's the fairer face <eos> Nurse : God ye good morrow gentlemen <eos> MERCUTIO : God ye good den fair gentlewoman <eos> Nurse : Is it good den <eos> MERCUTIO : 'Tis no less I tell you for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon <eos> Nurse : Out upon you <eos> what a man are you <eos> ROMEO : One gentlewoman that God hath made for himself to mar <eos> Nurse : By my troth it is well said 'for himself to mar' quoth a' <eos> Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo <eos> ROMEO : I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him : I am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse <eos> Nurse : You say well <eos> MERCUTIO : Yea is the worst well <eos> very well took i' faith wisely wisely <eos> Nurse : if you be he sir I desire some confidence with you <eos> BENVOLIO : She will indite him to some supper <eos> MERCUTIO : A bawd a bawd a bawd <eos> so ho <eos> ROMEO : What hast thou found <eos> MERCUTIO : No hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent <eos> An old hare hoar And an old hare hoar Is very good meat in lent But a hare that is hoar Is too much for a score When it hoars ere it be spent <eos> Romeo will you come to your father's <eos> we'll to dinner thither <eos> ROMEO : I will follow you <eos> MERCUTIO : Farewell ancient lady farewell 'lady lady lady <eos>' Nurse : Marry farewell <eos> I pray you sir what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery <eos> ROMEO : A gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month <eos> Nurse : An a' speak any thing against me I'll take him down an a' were lustier than he is and twenty such Jacks and if I cannot I'll find those that shall <eos> Scurvy knave <eos> I am none of his flirt-gills I am none of his skains-mates <eos> And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure <eos> PETER : I saw no man use you a pleasure if I had my weapon should quickly have been out I warrant you : I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side <eos> Nurse : Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about me quivers <eos> Scurvy knave <eos> Pray you sir a word : and as I told you my young lady bade me inquire you out what she bade me say I will keep to myself : but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behavior as they say : for the gentlewoman is young and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing <eos> ROMEO : Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress <eos> I protest unto thee <eos> Nurse : Good heart and i' faith I will tell her as much : Lord Lord she will be a joyful woman <eos> ROMEO : What wilt thou tell her nurse <eos> thou dost not mark me <eos> Nurse : I will tell her sir that you do protest which as I take it is a gentlemanlike offer <eos> ROMEO : Bid her devise Some means to come to shrift this afternoon And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell Be shrived and married <eos> Here is for thy pains <eos> Nurse : No truly sir not a penny <eos> ROMEO : Go to I say you shall <eos> Nurse : This afternoon sir <eos> well she shall be there <eos> ROMEO : And stay good nurse behind the abbey wall : Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night <eos> Farewell be trusty and I'll quit thy pains : Farewell commend me to thy mistress <eos> Nurse : Now God in heaven bless thee <eos> Hark you sir <eos> ROMEO : What say'st thou my dear nurse <eos> Nurse : Is your man secret <eos> Did you ne'er hear say Two may keep counsel putting one away <eos> ROMEO : I warrant thee my man's as true as steel <eos> NURSE : Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady <eos>Lord Lord <eos> when 'twas a little prating thing : <eos>O there is a nobleman in town one Paris that would fain lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lief see a toad a very toad as see him <eos> I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man but I'll warrant you when I say so she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world <eos> Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter <eos> ROMEO : Ay nurse what of that <eos> both with an R <eos> Nurse : Ah <eos> mocker <eos> that's the dog's name R is for the <eos>No I know it begins with some other letter : <eos>and she hath the prettiest sententious of it of you and rosemary that it would do you good to hear it <eos> ROMEO : Commend me to thy lady <eos> Nurse : Ay a thousand times <eos> Peter <eos> PETER : Anon <eos> Nurse : Peter take my fan and go before and apace <eos> JULIET : The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse In half an hour she promised to return <eos> Perchance she cannot meet him : that's not so <eos> O she is lame <eos> love's heralds should be thoughts Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams Driving back shadows over louring hills : Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings <eos> Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey and from nine till twelve Is three long hours yet she is not come <eos> Had she affections and warm youthful blood She would be as swift in motion as a ball My words would bandy her to my sweet love And his to me : But old folks many feign as they were dead Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead <eos> O God she comes <eos> O honey nurse what news <eos> Hast thou met with him <eos> Send thy man away <eos> Nurse : Peter stay at the gate <eos> JULIET : Now good sweet nurse <eos>O Lord why look'st thou sad <eos> Though news be sad yet tell them merrily If good thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face <eos> Nurse : I am a-weary give me leave awhile : Fie how my bones ache <eos> what a jaunt have I had <eos> JULIET : I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news : Nay come I pray thee speak good good nurse speak <eos> Nurse : Jesu what haste <eos> can you not stay awhile <eos> Do you not see that I am out of breath <eos> JULIET : How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath <eos> The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse <eos> Is thy news good or bad <eos> answer to that Say either and I'll stay the circumstance : Let me be satisfied is't good or bad <eos> Nurse : Well you have made a simple choice you know not how to choose a man : Romeo <eos> no not he though his face be better than any man's yet his leg excels all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body though they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare : he is not the flower of courtesy but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb <eos> Go thy ways wench serve God <eos> What have you dined at home <eos> JULIET : No no : but all this did I know before <eos> What says he of our marriage <eos> what of that <eos> Nurse : Lord how my head aches <eos> what a head have I <eos> It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces <eos> My back o' t' other side <eos>O my back my back <eos> Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with jaunting up and down <eos> JULIET : I' faith I am sorry that thou art not well <eos> Sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love <eos> Nurse : Your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and I warrant a virtuous <eos>Where is your mother <eos> JULIET : Where is my mother <eos> why she is within Where should she be <eos> How oddly thou repliest <eos> 'Your love says like an honest gentleman Where is your mother <eos>' Nurse : O God's lady dear <eos> Are you so hot <eos> marry come up I trow Is this the poultice for my aching bones <eos> Henceforward do your messages yourself <eos> JULIET : Here's such a coil <eos> come what says Romeo <eos> Nurse : Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day <eos> JULIET : I have <eos> Nurse : Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell There stays a husband to make you a wife : Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks They'll be in scarlet straight at any news <eos> Hie you to church I must another way To fetch a ladder by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark : I am the drudge and toil in your delight But you shall bear the burden soon at night <eos> Go I'll to dinner : hie you to the cell <eos> JULIET : Hie to high fortune <eos> Honest nurse farewell <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after hours with sorrow chide us not <eos> ROMEO : Amen amen <eos> but come what sorrow can It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight : Do thou but close our hands with holy words Then love-devouring death do what he dare It is enough I may but call her mine <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die like fire and powder Which as they kiss consume : the sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite : Therefore love moderately long love doth so Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow <eos> Here comes the lady : O so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint : A lover may bestride the gossamer That idles in the wanton summer air And yet not fall so light is vanity <eos> JULIET : Good even to my ghostly confessor <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both <eos> JULIET : As much to him else is his thanks too much <eos> ROMEO : Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath This neighbour air and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter <eos> JULIET : Conceit more rich in matter than in words Brags of his substance not of ornament : They are but beggars that can count their worth But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Come come with me and we will make short work For by your leaves you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one <eos> BENVOLIO : I pray thee good Mercutio let's retire : The day is hot the Capulets abroad And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring <eos> MERCUTIO : Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says 'God send me no need of thee <eos>' and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need <eos> BENVOLIO : Am I like such a fellow <eos> MERCUTIO : Come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved <eos> BENVOLIO : And what to <eos> MERCUTIO : Nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other <eos> Thou <eos> why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast : thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes : what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel <eos> Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling : thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun : didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter <eos> with another for tying his new shoes with old riband <eos> and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling <eos> BENVOLIO : An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter <eos> MERCUTIO : The fee-simple <eos> O simple <eos> BENVOLIO : By my head here come the Capulets <eos> MERCUTIO : By my heel I care not <eos> TYBALT : Follow me close for I will speak to them <eos> Gentlemen good den : a word with one of you <eos> MERCUTIO : And but one word with one of us <eos> couple it with something make it a word and a blow <eos> TYBALT : You shall find me apt enough to that sir an you will give me occasion <eos> MERCUTIO : Could you not take some occasion without giving <eos> TYBALT : Mercutio thou consort'st with Romeo <eos> MERCUTIO : Consort <eos> what dost thou make us minstrels <eos> an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords : here's my fiddlestick here's that shall make you dance <eos> 'Zounds consort <eos> BENVOLIO : We talk here in the public haunt of men : Either withdraw unto some private place And reason coldly of your grievances Or else depart here all eyes gaze on us <eos> MERCUTIO : Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze I will not budge for no man's pleasure I <eos> TYBALT : Well peace be with you sir : here comes my man <eos> MERCUTIO : But I'll be hanged sir if he wear your livery : Marry go before to field he'll be your follower Your worship in that sense may call him 'man <eos>' TYBALT : Romeo the hate I bear thee can afford No better term than this <eos>thou art a villain <eos> ROMEO : Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting : villain am I none Therefore farewell I see thou know'st me not <eos> TYBALT : Boy this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me therefore turn and draw <eos> ROMEO : I do protest I never injured thee But love thee better than thou canst devise Till thou shalt know the reason of my love : And so good Capulet <eos>which name I tender As dearly as my own <eos>be satisfied <eos> MERCUTIO : O calm dishonourable vile submission <eos> Alla stoccata carries it away <eos> Tybalt you rat-catcher will you walk <eos> TYBALT : What wouldst thou have with me <eos> MERCUTIO : Good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives that I mean to make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest of the eight <eos> Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears <eos> make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out <eos> TYBALT : I am for you <eos> ROMEO : Gentle Mercutio put thy rapier up <eos> MERCUTIO : Come sir your passado <eos> ROMEO : Draw Benvolio beat down their weapons <eos> Gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage <eos> Tybalt Mercutio the prince expressly hath Forbidden bandying in Verona streets : Hold Tybalt <eos> good Mercutio <eos> MERCUTIO : I am hurt <eos> A plague o' both your houses <eos> I am sped <eos> Is he gone and hath nothing <eos> BENVOLIO : What art thou hurt <eos> MERCUTIO : Ay ay a scratch a scratch marry 'tis enough <eos> Where is my page <eos> Go villain fetch a surgeon <eos> ROMEO : Courage man the hurt cannot be much <eos> MERCUTIO : No 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door but 'tis enough'twill serve : ask for me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man <eos> I am peppered I warrant for this world <eos> A plague o' both your houses <eos> 'Zounds a dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death <eos> a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic <eos> Why the devil came you between us <eos> I was hurt under your arm <eos> ROMEO : I thought all for the best <eos> MERCUTIO : Help me into some house Benvolio Or I shall faint <eos> A plague o' both your houses <eos> They have made worms' meat of me : I have it And soundly too : your houses <eos> ROMEO : This gentleman the prince's near ally My very friend hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf my reputation stain'd With Tybalt's slander <eos>Tybalt that an hour Hath been my kinsman <eos> O sweet Juliet Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper soften'd valour's steel <eos> BENVOLIO : O Romeo Romeo brave Mercutio's dead <eos> That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds Which too untimely here did scorn the earth <eos> ROMEO : This day's black fate on more days doth depend This but begins the woe others must end <eos> BENVOLIO : Here comes the furious Tybalt back again <eos> ROMEO : Alive in triumph <eos> and Mercutio slain <eos> Away to heaven respective lenity And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now <eos> Now Tybalt take the villain back again That late thou gavest me for Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads Staying for thine to keep him company : Either thou or I or both must go with him <eos> TYBALT : Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence <eos> ROMEO : This shall determine that <eos> BENVOLIO : Romeo away be gone <eos> The citizens are up and Tybalt slain <eos> Stand not amazed : the prince will doom thee death If thou art taken : hence be gone away <eos> ROMEO : O I am fortune's fool <eos> BENVOLIO : Why dost thou stay <eos> First Citizen : Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio <eos> Tybalt that murderer which way ran he <eos> BENVOLIO : There lies that Tybalt <eos> First Citizen : Up sir go with me I charge thee in the princes name obey <eos> PRINCE : Where are the vile beginners of this fray <eos> BENVOLIO : O noble prince I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl : There lies the man slain by young Romeo That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio <eos> LADY CAPULET : Tybalt my cousin <eos> O my brother's child <eos> O prince <eos> O cousin <eos> husband <eos> O the blood is spilt O my dear kinsman <eos> Prince as thou art true For blood of ours shed blood of Montague <eos> O cousin cousin <eos> PRINCE : Benvolio who began this bloody fray <eos> BENVOLIO : Tybalt here slain whom Romeo's hand did slay Romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink How nice the quarrel was and urged withal Your high displeasure : all this uttered With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow'd Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast Who all as hot turns deadly point to point And with a martial scorn with one hand beats Cold death aside and with the other sends It back to Tybalt whose dexterity Retorts it : Romeo he cries aloud 'Hold friends <eos> friends part <eos>' and swifter than his tongue His agile arm beats down their fatal points And 'twixt them rushes underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled But by and by comes back to Romeo Who had but newly entertain'd revenge And to 't they go like lightning for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain <eos> And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly <eos> This is the truth or let Benvolio die <eos> LADY CAPULET : He is a kinsman to the Montague Affection makes him false he speaks not true : Some twenty of them fought in this black strife And all those twenty could but kill one life <eos> I beg for justice which thou prince must give Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live <eos> PRINCE : Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe <eos> MONTAGUE : Not Romeo prince he was Mercutio's friend His fault concludes but what the law should end The life of Tybalt <eos> PRINCE : And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence : I have an interest in your hate's proceeding My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine : I will be deaf to pleading and excuses Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses : Therefore use none : let Romeo hence in haste Else when he's found that hour is his last <eos> Bear hence this body and attend our will : Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill <eos> JULIET : Gallop apace you fiery-footed steeds Towards Phoebus' lodging : such a wagoner As Phaethon would whip you to the west And bring in cloudy night immediately <eos> Spread thy close curtain love-performing night That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen <eos> Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties or if love be blind It best agrees with night <eos> Come civil night Thou sober-suited matron all in black And learn me how to lose a winning match Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods : Hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks With thy black mantle till strange love grown bold Think true love acted simple modesty <eos> Come night come Romeo come thou day in night For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow on a raven's back <eos> Come gentle night come loving black-brow'd night Give me my Romeo and when he shall die Take him and cut him out in little stars And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun <eos> O I have bought the mansion of a love But not possess'd it and though I am sold Not yet enjoy'd : so tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not wear them <eos> O here comes my nurse And she brings news and every tongue that speaks But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence <eos> Now nurse what news <eos> What hast thou there <eos> the cords That Romeo bid thee fetch <eos> Nurse : Ay ay the cords <eos> JULIET : Ay me <eos> what news <eos> why dost thou wring thy hands <eos> Nurse : Ah well-a-day <eos> he's dead he's dead he's dead <eos> We are undone lady we are undone <eos> Alack the day <eos> he's gone he's kill'd he's dead <eos> JULIET : Can heaven be so envious <eos> Nurse : Romeo can Though heaven cannot : O Romeo Romeo <eos> Who ever would have thought it <eos> Romeo <eos> JULIET : What devil art thou that dost torment me thus <eos> This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell <eos> Hath Romeo slain himself <eos> say thou but 'I' And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice : I am not I if there be such an I Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I <eos>' If he be slain say 'I' or if not no : Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe <eos> Nurse : I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes <eos> God save the mark <eos> <eos>here on his manly breast : A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse Pale pale as ashes all bedaub'd in blood All in gore-blood I swounded at the sight <eos> JULIET : O break my heart <eos> poor bankrupt break at once <eos> To prison eyes ne'er look on liberty <eos> Vile earth to earth resign end motion here And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier <eos> Nurse : O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had <eos> O courteous Tybalt <eos> honest gentleman <eos> That ever I should live to see thee dead <eos> JULIET : What storm is this that blows so contrary <eos> Is Romeo slaughter'd and is Tybalt dead <eos> My dear-loved cousin and my dearer lord <eos> Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom <eos> For who is living if those two are gone <eos> Nurse : Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished Romeo that kill'd him he is banished <eos> JULIET : O God <eos> did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood <eos> Nurse : It did it did alas the day it did <eos> JULIET : O serpent heart hid with a flowering face <eos> Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave <eos> Beautiful tyrant <eos> fiend angelical <eos> Dove-feather'd raven <eos> wolvish-ravening lamb <eos> Despised substance of divinest show <eos> Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st A damned saint an honourable villain <eos> O nature what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh <eos> Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound <eos> O that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace <eos> Nurse : There's no trust No faith no honesty in men all perjured All forsworn all naught all dissemblers <eos> Ah where's my man <eos> give me some aqua vitae : These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old <eos> Shame come to Romeo <eos> JULIET : Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish <eos> he was not born to shame : Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd Sole monarch of the universal earth <eos> O what a beast was I to chide at him <eos> Nurse : Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin <eos> JULIET : Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband <eos> Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name When I thy three-hours wife have mangled it <eos> But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin <eos> That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband : Back foolish tears back to your native spring Your tributary drops belong to woe Which you mistaking offer up to joy <eos> My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain And Tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband : All this is comfort wherefore weep I then <eos> Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death That murder'd me : I would forget it fain But O it presses to my memory Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds : 'Tybalt is dead and Romeo <eos>banished' That 'banished' that one word 'banished' Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts <eos> Tybalt's death Was woe enough if it had ended there : Or if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be rank'd with other griefs Why follow'd not when she said 'Tybalt's dead' Thy father or thy mother nay or both Which modern lamentations might have moved <eos> But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death 'Romeo is banished' to speak that word Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet All slain all dead <eos> 'Romeo is banished <eos>' There is no end no limit measure bound In that word's death no words can that woe sound <eos> Where is my father and my mother nurse <eos> Nurse : Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse : Will you go to them <eos> I will bring you thither <eos> JULIET : Wash they his wounds with tears : mine shall be spent When theirs are dry for Romeo's banishment <eos> Take up those cords : poor ropes you are beguiled Both you and I for Romeo is exiled : He made you for a highway to my bed But I a maid die maiden-widowed <eos> Come cords come nurse I'll to my wedding-bed And death not Romeo take my maidenhead <eos> Nurse : Hie to your chamber : I'll find Romeo To comfort you : I wot well where he is <eos> Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night : I'll to him he is hid at Laurence' cell <eos> JULIET : O find him <eos> give this ring to my true knight And bid him come to take his last farewell <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man : Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts And thou art wedded to calamity <eos> ROMEO : Father what news <eos> what is the prince's doom <eos> What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand That I yet know not <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company : I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom <eos> ROMEO : What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips Not body's death but body's banishment <eos> ROMEO : Ha banishment <eos> be merciful say 'death' For exile hath more terror in his look Much more than death : do not say 'banishment <eos>' FRIAR LAURENCE : Hence from Verona art thou banished : Be patient for the world is broad and wide <eos> ROMEO : There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory torture hell itself <eos> Hence-banished is banish'd from the world And world's exile is death : then banished Is death mis-term'd : calling death banishment Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe And smilest upon the stroke that murders me <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : O deadly sin <eos> O rude unthankfulness <eos> Thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince Taking thy part hath rush'd aside the law And turn'd that black word death to banishment : This is dear mercy and thou seest it not <eos> ROMEO : 'Tis torture and not mercy : heaven is here Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog And little mouse every unworthy thing Live here in heaven and may look on her But Romeo may not : more validity More honourable state more courtship lives In carrion-flies than Romeo : they my seize On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand And steal immortal blessing from her lips Who even in pure and vestal modesty Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin But Romeo may not he is banished : Flies may do this but I from this must fly : They are free men but I am banished <eos> And say'st thou yet that exile is not death <eos> Hadst thou no poison mix'd no sharp-ground knife No sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean But 'banished' to kill me <eos> <eos>'banished' <eos> O friar the damned use that word in hell Howlings attend it : how hast thou the heart Being a divine a ghostly confessor A sin-absolver and my friend profess'd To mangle me with that word 'banished' <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word <eos> ROMEO : O thou wilt speak again of banishment <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : I'll give thee armour to keep off that word : Adversity's sweet milk philosophy To comfort thee though thou art banished <eos> ROMEO : Yet 'banished' <eos> Hang up philosophy <eos> Unless philosophy can make a Juliet Displant a town reverse a prince's doom It helps not it prevails not : talk no more <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : O then I see that madmen have no ears <eos> ROMEO : How should they when that wise men have no eyes <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Let me dispute with thee of thy estate <eos> ROMEO : Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel : Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love An hour but married Tybalt murdered Doting like me and like me banished Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground as I do now Taking the measure of an unmade grave <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Arise one knocks good Romeo hide thyself <eos> ROMEO : Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Hark how they knock <eos> Who's there <eos> Romeo arise Thou wilt be taken <eos> Stay awhile <eos> Stand up Run to my study <eos> By and by <eos> God's will What simpleness is this <eos> I come I come <eos> Who knocks so hard <eos> whence come you <eos> what's your will <eos> Nurse : FRIAR LAURENCE : Welcome then <eos> Nurse : O holy friar O tell me holy friar Where is my lady's lord where's Romeo <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : There on the ground with his own tears made drunk <eos> Nurse : O he is even in my mistress' case Just in her case <eos> O woful sympathy <eos> Piteous predicament <eos> Even so lies she Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering <eos> Stand up stand up stand and you be a man : For Juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand Why should you fall into so deep an O <eos> ROMEO : Nurse <eos> Nurse : Ah sir <eos> ah sir <eos> Well death's the end of all <eos> ROMEO : Spakest thou of Juliet <eos> how is it with her <eos> Doth she not think me an old murderer Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy With blood removed but little from her own <eos> Where is she <eos> and how doth she <eos> and what says My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love <eos> Nurse : O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps And now falls on her bed and then starts up And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries And then down falls again <eos> ROMEO : As if that name Shot from the deadly level of a gun Did murder her as that name's cursed hand Murder'd her kinsman <eos> O tell me friar tell me In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge <eos> tell me that I may sack The hateful mansion <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold thy desperate hand : Art thou a man <eos> thy form cries out thou art : Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast : Unseemly woman in a seeming man <eos> Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both <eos> Thou hast amazed me : by my holy order I thought thy disposition better temper'd <eos> Hast thou slain Tybalt <eos> wilt thou slay thyself <eos> And stay thy lady too that lives in thee By doing damned hate upon thyself <eos> Why rail'st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth <eos> Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose <eos> Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit Which like a usurer abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit : Thy noble shape is but a form of wax Digressing from the valour of a man Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish Thy wit that ornament to shape and love Misshapen in the conduct of them both Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask Is set afire by thine own ignorance And thou dismember'd with thine own defence <eos> What rouse thee man <eos> thy Juliet is alive For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead There art thou happy : Tybalt would kill thee But thou slew'st Tybalt there are thou happy too : The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile there art thou happy : A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back Happiness courts thee in her best array But like a misbehaved and sullen wench Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love : Take heed take heed for such die miserable <eos> Go get thee to thy love as was decreed Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her : But look thou stay not till the watch be set For then thou canst not pass to Mantua Where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends Beg pardon of the prince and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went'st forth in lamentation <eos> Go before nurse : commend me to thy lady And bid her hasten all the house to bed Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto : Romeo is coming <eos> Nurse : O Lord I could have stay'd here all the night To hear good counsel : O what learning is <eos> My lord I'll tell my lady you will come <eos> ROMEO : Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide <eos> Nurse : Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir : Hie you make haste for it grows very late <eos> ROMEO : How well my comfort is revived by this <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Go hence good night and here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set Or by the break of day disguised from hence : Sojourn in Mantua I'll find out your man And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here : Give me thy hand 'tis late : farewell good night <eos> ROMEO : But that a joy past joy calls out on me It were a grief so brief to part with thee : Farewell <eos> CAPULET : Things have fall'n out sir so unluckily That we have had no time to move our daughter : Look you she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly And so did I : <eos>Well we were born to die <eos> 'Tis very late she'll not come down to-night : I promise you but for your company I would have been a-bed an hour ago <eos> PARIS : These times of woe afford no time to woo <eos> Madam good night : commend me to your daughter <eos> LADY CAPULET : I will and know her mind early to-morrow To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness <eos> CAPULET : Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love : I think she will be ruled In all respects by me nay more I doubt it not <eos> Wife go you to her ere you go to bed Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love And bid her mark you me on Wednesday next <eos> But soft <eos> what day is this <eos> PARIS : Monday my lord CAPULET : Monday <eos> ha ha <eos> Well Wednesday is too soon O' Thursday let it be : o' Thursday tell her She shall be married to this noble earl <eos> Will you be ready <eos> do you like this haste <eos> We'll keep no great ado <eos>a friend or two For hark you Tybalt being slain so late It may be thought we held him carelessly Being our kinsman if we revel much : Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends And there an end <eos> But what say you to Thursday <eos> PARIS : My lord I would that Thursday were to-morrow <eos> CAPULET : Well get you gone : o' Thursday be it then <eos> Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed Prepare her wife against this wedding-day <eos> Farewell my lord <eos> Light to my chamber ho <eos> Afore me <eos> it is so very very late That we may call it early by and by <eos> Good night <eos> JULIET : Wilt thou be gone <eos> it is not yet near day : It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree : Believe me love it was the nightingale <eos> ROMEO : It was the lark the herald of the morn No nightingale : look love what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east : Night's candles are burnt out and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops <eos> I must be gone and live or stay and die <eos> JULIET : Yon light is not day-light I know it I : It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torch-bearer And light thee on thy way to Mantua : Therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone <eos> ROMEO : Let me be ta'en let me be put to death I am content so thou wilt have it so <eos> I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads : I have more care to stay than will to go : Come death and welcome <eos> Juliet wills it so <eos> How is't my soul <eos> let's talk it is not day <eos> JULIET : It is it is : hie hence be gone away <eos> It is the lark that sings so out of tune Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps <eos> Some say the lark makes sweet division This doth not so for she divideth us : Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes O now I would they had changed voices too <eos> Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day O now be gone more light and light it grows <eos> ROMEO : More light and light more dark and dark our woes <eos> Nurse : Madam <eos> JULIET : Nurse <eos> Nurse : Your lady mother is coming to your chamber : The day is broke be wary look about <eos> JULIET : Then window let day in and let life out <eos> ROMEO : Farewell farewell <eos> one kiss and I'll descend <eos> JULIET : Art thou gone so <eos> love lord ay husband friend <eos> I must hear from thee every day in the hour For in a minute there are many days : O by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo <eos> ROMEO : Farewell <eos> I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings love to thee <eos> JULIET : O think'st thou we shall ever meet again <eos> ROMEO : I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come <eos> JULIET : O God I have an ill-divining soul <eos> Methinks I see thee now thou art below As one dead in the bottom of a tomb : Either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale <eos> ROMEO : And trust me love in my eye so do you : Dry sorrow drinks our blood <eos> Adieu adieu <eos> JULIET : O fortune fortune <eos> all men call thee fickle : If thou art fickle what dost thou with him <eos> That is renown'd for faith <eos> Be fickle fortune For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back <eos> LADY CAPULET : JULIET : Who is't that calls <eos> is it my lady mother <eos> Is she not down so late or up so early <eos> What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither <eos> LADY CAPULET : Why how now Juliet <eos> JULIET : Madam I am not well <eos> LADY CAPULET : Evermore weeping for your cousin's death <eos> What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears <eos> An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live Therefore have done : some grief shows much of love But much of grief shows still some want of wit <eos> JULIET : Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss <eos> LADY CAPULET : So shall you feel the loss but not the friend Which you weep for <eos> JULIET : Feeling so the loss Cannot choose but ever weep the friend <eos> LADY CAPULET : Well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him <eos> JULIET : What villain madam <eos> LADY CAPULET : That same villain Romeo <eos> JULIET : LADY CAPULET : That is because the traitor murderer lives <eos> JULIET : Ay madam from the reach of these my hands : Would none but I might venge my cousin's death <eos> LADY CAPULET : We will have vengeance for it fear thou not : Then weep no more <eos> I'll send to one in Mantua Where that same banish'd runagate doth live Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company : And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied <eos> JULIET : Indeed I never shall be satisfied With Romeo till I behold him <eos>dead <eos> Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd <eos> Madam if you could find out but a man To bear a poison I would temper it That Romeo should upon receipt thereof Soon sleep in quiet <eos> O how my heart abhors To hear him named and cannot come to him <eos> To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughter'd him <eos> LADY CAPULET : Find thou the means and I'll find such a man <eos> But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings girl <eos> JULIET : And joy comes well in such a needy time : What are they I beseech your ladyship <eos> LADY CAPULET : Well well thou hast a careful father child One who to put thee from thy heaviness Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for <eos> JULIET : Madam in happy time what day is that <eos> LADY CAPULET : Marry my child early next Thursday morn The gallant young and noble gentleman The County Paris at Saint Peter's Church Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride <eos> JULIET : Now by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too He shall not make me there a joyful bride <eos> I wonder at this haste that I must wed Ere he that should be husband comes to woo <eos> I pray you tell my lord and father madam I will not marry yet and when I do I swear It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate Rather than Paris <eos> These are news indeed <eos> LADY CAPULET : Here comes your father tell him so yourself And see how he will take it at your hands <eos> CAPULET : When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew But for the sunset of my brother's son It rains downright <eos> How now <eos> a conduit girl <eos> what still in tears <eos> Evermore showering <eos> In one little body Thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind For still thy eyes which I may call the sea Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs Who raging with thy tears and they with them Without a sudden calm will overset Thy tempest-tossed body <eos> How now wife <eos> Have you deliver'd to her our decree <eos> LADY CAPULET : Ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks <eos> I would the fool were married to her grave <eos> CAPULET : Soft <eos> take me with you take me with you wife <eos> How <eos> will she none <eos> doth she not give us thanks <eos> Is she not proud <eos> doth she not count her blest Unworthy as she is that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom <eos> JULIET : Not proud you have but thankful that you have : Proud can I never be of what I hate But thankful even for hate that is meant love <eos> CAPULET : How now how now chop-logic <eos> What is this <eos> 'Proud' and 'I thank you' and 'I thank you not' And yet 'not proud' mistress minion you Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither <eos> Out you green-sickness carrion <eos> out you baggage <eos> You tallow-face <eos> LADY CAPULET : Fie fie <eos> what are you mad <eos> JULIET : Good father I beseech you on my knees Hear me with patience but to speak a word <eos> CAPULET : Hang thee young baggage <eos> disobedient wretch <eos> I tell thee what : get thee to church o' Thursday Or never after look me in the face : Speak not reply not do not answer me My fingers itch <eos> Wife we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child But now I see this one is one too much And that we have a curse in having her : Out on her hilding <eos> Nurse : God in heaven bless her <eos> You are to blame my lord to rate her so <eos> CAPULET : And why my lady wisdom <eos> hold your tongue Good prudence smatter with your gossips go <eos> Nurse : I speak no treason <eos> CAPULET : O God ye god-den <eos> Nurse : May not one speak <eos> CAPULET : Peace you mumbling fool <eos> Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl For here we need it not <eos> LADY CAPULET : You are too hot <eos> CAPULET : God's bread <eos> it makes me mad : Day night hour tide time work play Alone in company still my care hath been To have her match'd : and having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage Of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train'd Stuff'd as they say with honourable parts Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man And then to have a wretched puling fool A whining mammet in her fortune's tender To answer 'I'll not wed I cannot love I am too young I pray you pardon me <eos>' But as you will not wed I'll pardon you : Graze where you will you shall not house with me : Look to't think on't I do not use to jest <eos> Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise : An you be mine I'll give you to my friend And you be not hang beg starve die in the streets For by my soul I'll ne'er acknowledge thee Nor what is mine shall never do thee good : Trust to't bethink you I'll not be forsworn <eos> JULIET : Is there no pity sitting in the clouds That sees into the bottom of my grief <eos> O sweet my mother cast me not away <eos> Delay this marriage for a month a week Or if you do not make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies <eos> LADY CAPULET : Talk not to me for I'll not speak a word : Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee <eos> JULIET : O God <eos> <eos>O nurse how shall this be prevented <eos> My husband is on earth my faith in heaven How shall that faith return again to earth Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth <eos> comfort me counsel me <eos> Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself <eos> What say'st thou <eos> hast thou not a word of joy <eos> Some comfort nurse <eos> Nurse : Faith here it is <eos> Romeo is banish'd and all the world to nothing That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you Or if he do it needs must be by stealth <eos> Then since the case so stands as now it doth I think it best you married with the county <eos> O he's a lovely gentleman <eos> Romeo's a dishclout to him : an eagle madam Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye As Paris hath <eos> Beshrew my very heart I think you are happy in this second match For it excels your first : or if it did not Your first is dead or 'twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him <eos> JULIET : Speakest thou from thy heart <eos> Nurse : And from my soul too Or else beshrew them both <eos> JULIET : Amen <eos> Nurse : What <eos> JULIET : Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much <eos> Go in : and tell my lady I am gone Having displeased my father to Laurence' cell To make confession and to be absolved <eos> Nurse : Marry I will and this is wisely done <eos> JULIET : Ancient damnation <eos> O most wicked fiend <eos> Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath praised him with above compare So many thousand times <eos> Go counsellor Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain <eos> I'll to the friar to know his remedy : If all else fail myself have power to die <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : On Thursday sir <eos> the time is very short <eos> PARIS : My father Capulet will have it so And I am nothing slow to slack his haste <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : You say you do not know the lady's mind : Uneven is the course I like it not <eos> PARIS : Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death And therefore have I little talk'd of love For Venus smiles not in a house of tears <eos> Now sir her father counts it dangerous That she doth give her sorrow so much sway And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears Which too much minded by herself alone May be put from her by society : Now do you know the reason of this haste <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : PARIS : Happily met my lady and my wife <eos> JULIET : That may be sir when I may be a wife <eos> PARIS : That may be must be love on Thursday next <eos> JULIET : What must be shall be <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : That's a certain text <eos> PARIS : Come you to make confession to this father <eos> JULIET : To answer that I should confess to you <eos> PARIS : Do not deny to him that you love me <eos> JULIET : I will confess to you that I love him <eos> PARIS : So will ye I am sure that you love me <eos> JULIET : If I do so it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face <eos> PARIS : Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears <eos> JULIET : The tears have got small victory by that For it was bad enough before their spite <eos> PARIS : Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report <eos> JULIET : That is no slander sir which is a truth And what I spake I spake it to my face <eos> PARIS : Thy face is mine and thou hast slander'd it <eos> JULIET : It may be so for it is not mine own <eos> Are you at leisure holy father now Or shall I come to you at evening mass <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : My leisure serves me pensive daughter now <eos> My lord we must entreat the time alone <eos> PARIS : God shield I should disturb devotion <eos> Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye : Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss <eos> JULIET : O shut the door <eos> and when thou hast done so Come weep with me past hope past cure past help <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Ah Juliet I already know thy grief It strains me past the compass of my wits : I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it On Thursday next be married to this county <eos> JULIET : Tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it : If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this knife I'll help it presently <eos> God join'd my heart and Romeo's thou our hands And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal'd Shall be the label to another deed Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another this shall slay them both : Therefore out of thy long-experienced time Give me some present counsel or behold 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring <eos> Be not so long to speak I long to die If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold daughter : I do spy a kind of hope Which craves as desperate an execution <eos> As that is desperate which we would prevent <eos> If rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame That copest with death himself to scape from it : And if thou darest I'll give thee remedy <eos> JULIET : O bid me leap rather than marry Paris From off the battlements of yonder tower Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls Or bid me go into a new-made grave And hide me with a dead man in his shroud Things that to hear them told have made me tremble And I will do it without fear or doubt To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold then go home be merry give consent To marry Paris : Wednesday is to-morrow : To-morrow night look that thou lie alone Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber : Take thou this vial being then in bed And this distilled liquor drink thou off When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse Shall keep his native progress but surcease : No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall Like death when he shuts up the day of life Each part deprived of supple government Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death : And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours And then awake as from a pleasant sleep <eos> Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead : Then as the manner of our country is In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie <eos> In the mean time against thou shalt awake Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift And hither shall he come : and he and I Will watch thy waking and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua <eos> And this shall free thee from this present shame If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it <eos> JULIET : Give me give me <eos> O tell not me of fear <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold get you gone be strong and prosperous In this resolve : I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua with my letters to thy lord <eos> JULIET : Love give me strength <eos> and strength shall help afford <eos> Farewell dear father <eos> CAPULET : So many guests invite as here are writ <eos> Sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks <eos> Second Servant : You shall have none ill sir for I'll try if they can lick their fingers <eos> CAPULET : How canst thou try them so <eos> Second Servant : Marry sir 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers : therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me <eos> CAPULET : Go be gone <eos> We shall be much unfurnished for this time <eos> What is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence <eos> Nurse : Ay forsooth <eos> CAPULET : Well he may chance to do some good on her : A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is <eos> Nurse : See where she comes from shrift with merry look <eos> CAPULET : How now my headstrong <eos> where have you been gadding <eos> JULIET : Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests and am enjoin'd By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here And beg your pardon : pardon I beseech you <eos> Henceforward I am ever ruled by you <eos> CAPULET : Send for the county go tell him of this : I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning <eos> JULIET : I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell And gave him what becomed love I might Not step o'er the bounds of modesty <eos> CAPULET : Why I am glad on't this is well : stand up : This is as't should be <eos> Let me see the county Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither <eos> Now afore God <eos> this reverend holy friar Our whole city is much bound to him <eos> JULIET : Nurse will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow <eos> LADY CAPULET : No not till Thursday there is time enough <eos> CAPULET : Go nurse go with her : we'll to church to-morrow <eos> LADY CAPULET : We shall be short in our provision : 'Tis now near night <eos> CAPULET : Tush I will stir about And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife : Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her I'll not to bed to-night let me alone I'll play the housewife for this once <eos> What ho <eos> They are all forth <eos> Well I will walk myself To County Paris to prepare him up Against to-morrow : my heart is wondrous light Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd <eos> JULIET : Ay those attires are best : but gentle nurse I pray thee leave me to myself to-night For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state Which well thou know'st is cross and full of sin <eos> LADY CAPULET : What are you busy ho <eos> need you my help <eos> JULIET : No madam we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow : So please you let me now be left alone And let the nurse this night sit up with you For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business <eos> LADY CAPULET : Good night : Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need <eos> JULIET : Farewell <eos> God knows when we shall meet again <eos> I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life : I'll call them back again to comfort me : Nurse <eos> What should she do here <eos> My dismal scene I needs must act alone <eos> Come vial <eos> What if this mixture do not work at all <eos> Shall I be married then to-morrow morning <eos> No no : this shall forbid it : lie thou there <eos> What if it be a poison which the friar Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd Because he married me before to Romeo <eos> I fear it is : and yet methinks it should not For he hath still been tried a holy man <eos> How if when I am laid into the tomb I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me <eos> there's a fearful point <eos> Shall I not then be stifled in the vault To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes <eos> Or if I live is it not very like The horrible conceit of death and night Together with the terror of the place <eos> As in a vault an ancient receptacle Where for these many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed : Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth Lies festering in his shroud where as they say At some hours in the night spirits resort <eos> Alack alack is it not like that I So early waking what with loathsome smells And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth That living mortals hearing them run mad : <eos> O if I wake shall I not be distraught Environed with all these hideous fears <eos> And madly play with my forefather's joints <eos> And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud <eos> And in this rage with some great kinsman's bone As with a club dash out my desperate brains <eos> O look <eos> methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point : stay Tybalt stay <eos> Romeo I come <eos> this do I drink to thee <eos> LADY CAPULET : Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse <eos> Nurse : They call for dates and quinces in the pastry <eos> CAPULET : Come stir stir stir <eos> the second cock hath crow'd The curfew-bell hath rung 'tis three o'clock : Look to the baked meats good Angelica : Spare not for the cost <eos> Nurse : Go you cot-quean go Get you to bed faith You'll be sick to-morrow For this night's watching <eos> CAPULET : No not a whit : what <eos> I have watch'd ere now All night for lesser cause and ne'er been sick <eos> LADY CAPULET : Ay you have been a mouse-hunt in your time But I will watch you from such watching now <eos> CAPULET : A jealous hood a jealous hood <eos> Now fellow What's there <eos> First Servant : Things for the cook sir but I know not what <eos> CAPULET : Make haste make haste <eos> Sirrah fetch drier logs : Call Peter he will show thee where they are <eos> Second Servant : I have a head sir that will find out logs And never trouble Peter for the matter <eos> CAPULET : Mass and well said a merry whoreson ha <eos> Thou shalt be logger-head <eos> Good faith 'tis day : The county will be here with music straight For so he said he would : I hear him near <eos> Nurse <eos> Wife <eos> What ho <eos> What nurse I say <eos> Go waken Juliet go and trim her up I'll go and chat with Paris : hie make haste Make haste the bridegroom he is come already : Make haste I say <eos> Nurse : Mistress <eos> what mistress <eos> Juliet <eos> fast I warrant her she : Why lamb <eos> why lady <eos> fie you slug-a-bed <eos> Why love I say <eos> madam <eos> sweet-heart <eos> why bride <eos> What not a word <eos> you take your pennyworths now Sleep for a week for the next night I warrant The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little <eos> God forgive me Marry and amen how sound is she asleep <eos> I must needs wake her <eos> Madam madam madam <eos> Ay let the county take you in your bed He'll fright you up i' faith <eos> Will it not be <eos> What dress'd <eos> and in your clothes <eos> and down again <eos> I must needs wake you Lady <eos> lady <eos> lady <eos> Alas alas <eos> Help help <eos> my lady's dead <eos> O well-a-day that ever I was born <eos> Some aqua vitae ho <eos> My lord <eos> my lady <eos> LADY CAPULET : What noise is here <eos> Nurse : O lamentable day <eos> LADY CAPULET : What is the matter <eos> Nurse : Look look <eos> O heavy day <eos> LADY CAPULET : O me O me <eos> My child my only life Revive look up or I will die with thee <eos> Help help <eos> Call help <eos> CAPULET : For shame bring Juliet forth her lord is come <eos> Nurse : She's dead deceased she's dead alack the day <eos> LADY CAPULET : Alack the day she's dead she's dead she's dead <eos> CAPULET : Ha <eos> let me see her : out alas <eos> she's cold : Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff Life and these lips have long been separated : Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field <eos> Nurse : O lamentable day <eos> LADY CAPULET : O woful time <eos> CAPULET : Death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Come is the bride ready to go to church <eos> CAPULET : Ready to go but never to return <eos> O son <eos> the night before thy wedding-day Hath Death lain with thy wife <eos> There she lies Flower as she was deflowered by him <eos> Death is my son-in-law Death is my heir My daughter he hath wedded : I will die And leave him all life living all is Death's <eos> PARIS : Have I thought long to see this morning's face And doth it give me such a sight as this <eos> LADY CAPULET : Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day <eos> Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage <eos> But one poor one one poor and loving child But one thing to rejoice and solace in And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight <eos> Nurse : O woe <eos> O woful woful woful day <eos> Most lamentable day most woful day That ever ever I did yet behold <eos> O day <eos> O day <eos> O day <eos> O hateful day <eos> Never was seen so black a day as this : O woful day O woful day <eos> PARIS : Beguiled divorced wronged spited slain <eos> Most detestable death by thee beguil'd By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown <eos> O love <eos> O life <eos> not life but love in death <eos> CAPULET : Despised distressed hated martyr'd kill'd <eos> Uncomfortable time why camest thou now To murder murder our solemnity <eos> O child <eos> O child <eos> my soul and not my child <eos> Dead art thou <eos> Alack <eos> my child is dead And with my child my joys are buried <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Peace ho for shame <eos> confusion's cure lives not In these confusions <eos> Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all And all the better is it for the maid : Your part in her you could not keep from death But heaven keeps his part in eternal life <eos> The most you sought was her promotion For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced : And weep ye now seeing she is advanced Above the clouds as high as heaven itself <eos> O in this love you love your child so ill That you run mad seeing that she is well : She's not well married that lives married long But she's best married that dies married young <eos> Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary On this fair corse and as the custom is In all her best array bear her to church : For though fond nature bids us an lament Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment <eos> CAPULET : All things that we ordained festival Turn from their office to black funeral Our instruments to melancholy bells Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse And all things change them to the contrary <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Sir go you in and madam go with him And go Sir Paris every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave : The heavens do lour upon you for some ill Move them no more by crossing their high will <eos> First Musician : Faith we may put up our pipes and be gone <eos> Nurse : Honest goodfellows ah put up put up For well you know this is a pitiful case <eos> First Musician : Ay by my troth the case may be amended <eos> PETER : Musicians O musicians 'Heart's ease Heart's ease :' O an you will have me live play 'Heart's ease <eos>' First Musician : Why 'Heart's ease <eos>' PETER : O musicians because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full of woe :' O play me some merry dump to comfort me <eos> First Musician : Not a dump we 'tis no time to play now <eos> PETER : You will not then <eos> First Musician : No <eos> PETER : I will then give it you soundly <eos> First Musician : What will you give us <eos> PETER : No money on my faith but the gleek I will give you the minstrel <eos> First Musician : Then I will give you the serving-creature <eos> PETER : Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate <eos> I will carry no crotchets : I'll re you I'll fa you do you note me <eos> First Musician : An you re us and fa us you note us <eos> Second Musician : Pray you put up your dagger and put out your wit <eos> PETER : Then have at you with my wit <eos> I will dry-beat you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger <eos> Answer me like men : 'When griping grief the heart doth wound And doleful dumps the mind oppress Then music with her silver sound' <eos> why 'silver sound' <eos> why 'music with her silver sound' <eos> What say you Simon Catling <eos> Musician : Marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound <eos> PETER : Pretty <eos> What say you Hugh Rebeck <eos> Second Musician : I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver <eos> PETER : Pretty too <eos> What say you James Soundpost <eos> Third Musician : Faith I know not what to say <eos> PETER : O I cry you mercy you are the singer : I will say for you <eos> It is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no gold for sounding : 'Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress <eos>' First Musician : What a pestilent knave is this same <eos> Second Musician : Hang him Jack <eos> Come we'll in here tarry for the mourners and stay dinner <eos> ROMEO : If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand : My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts <eos> I dreamt my lady came and found me dead <eos> Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think <eos> <eos> And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That I revived and was an emperor <eos> Ah me <eos> how sweet is love itself possess'd When but love's shadows are so rich in joy <eos> News from Verona <eos> <eos>How now Balthasar <eos> Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar <eos> How doth my lady <eos> Is my father well <eos> How fares my Juliet <eos> that I ask again For nothing can be ill if she be well <eos> BALTHASAR : Then she is well and nothing can be ill : Her body sleeps in Capel's monument And her immortal part with angels lives <eos> I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you : O pardon me for bringing these ill news Since you did leave it for my office sir <eos> ROMEO : Is it even so <eos> then I defy you stars <eos> Thou know'st my lodging : get me ink and paper And hire post-horses I will hence to-night <eos> BALTHASAR : I do beseech you sir have patience : Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure <eos> ROMEO : Tush thou art deceived : Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do <eos> Hast thou no letters to me from the friar <eos> BALTHASAR : No my good lord <eos> ROMEO : No matter : get thee gone And hire those horses I'll be with thee straight <eos> Well Juliet I will lie with thee to-night <eos> Let's see for means : O mischief thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men <eos> I do remember an apothecary <eos> And hereabouts he dwells <eos>which late I noted In tatter'd weeds with overwhelming brows Culling of simples meagre were his looks Sharp misery had worn him to the bones : And in his needy shop a tortoise hung An alligator stuff'd and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses Were thinly scatter'd to make up a show <eos> Noting this penury to myself I said 'An if a man did need a poison now Whose sale is present death in Mantua Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him <eos>' O this same thought did but forerun my need And this same needy man must sell it me <eos> As I remember this should be the house <eos> Being holiday the beggar's shop is shut <eos> What ho <eos> apothecary <eos> Apothecary : Who calls so loud <eos> ROMEO : Come hither man <eos> I see that thou art poor : Hold there is forty ducats : let me have A dram of poison such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead And that the trunk may be discharged of breath As violently as hasty powder fired Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb <eos> Apothecary : Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them <eos> ROMEO : Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness And fear'st to die <eos> famine is in thy cheeks Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back The world is not thy friend nor the world's law The world affords no law to make thee rich Then be not poor but break it and take this <eos> Apothecary : My poverty but not my will consents <eos> ROMEO : I pay thy poverty and not thy will <eos> Apothecary : Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off and if you had the strength Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight <eos> ROMEO : There is thy gold worse poison to men's souls Doing more murders in this loathsome world Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell <eos> I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none <eos> Farewell : buy food and get thyself in flesh <eos> Come cordial and not poison go with me To Juliet's grave for there must I use thee <eos> FRIAR JOHN : Holy Franciscan friar <eos> brother ho <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : This same should be the voice of Friar John <eos> Welcome from Mantua : what says Romeo <eos> Or if his mind be writ give me his letter <eos> FRIAR JOHN : Going to find a bare-foot brother out One of our order to associate me Here in this city visiting the sick And finding him the searchers of the town Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign Seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Who bare my letter then to Romeo <eos> FRIAR JOHN : I could not send it <eos>here it is again <eos> Nor get a messenger to bring it thee So fearful were they of infection <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Unhappy fortune <eos> by my brotherhood The letter was not nice but full of charge Of dear import and the neglecting it May do much danger <eos> Friar John go hence Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell <eos> FRIAR JOHN : Brother I'll go and bring it thee <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Now must I to the monument alone Within three hours will fair Juliet wake : She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents But I will write again to Mantua And keep her at my cell till Romeo come Poor living corse closed in a dead man's tomb <eos> PARIS : Give me thy torch boy : hence and stand aloof : Yet put it out for I would not be seen <eos> Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves But thou shalt hear it : whistle then to me As signal that thou hear'st something approach <eos> Give me those flowers <eos> Do as I bid thee go <eos> PAGE : PARIS : Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew <eos> O woe <eos> thy canopy is dust and stones <eos> Which with sweet water nightly I will dew Or wanting that with tears distill'd by moans : The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep <eos> The boy gives warning something doth approach <eos> What cursed foot wanders this way to-night To cross my obsequies and true love's rite <eos> What with a torch <eos> muffle me night awhile <eos> ROMEO : Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron <eos> Hold take this letter early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father <eos> Give me the light : upon thy life I charge thee Whate'er thou hear'st or seest stand all aloof And do not interrupt me in my course <eos> Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady's face But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring a ring that I must use In dear employment : therefore hence be gone : But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs : The time and my intents are savage-wild More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea <eos> BALTHASAR : I will be gone sir and not trouble you <eos> ROMEO : So shalt thou show me friendship <eos> Take thou that : Live and be prosperous : and farewell good fellow <eos> BALTHASAR : ROMEO : Thou detestable maw thou womb of death Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open And in despite I'll cram thee with more food <eos> PARIS : This is that banish'd haughty Montague That murder'd my love's cousin with which grief It is supposed the fair creature died And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies : I will apprehend him <eos> Stop thy unhallow'd toil vile Montague <eos> Can vengeance be pursued further than death <eos> Condemned villain I do apprehend thee : Obey and go with me for thou must die <eos> ROMEO : I must indeed and therefore came I hither <eos> Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man Fly hence and leave me : think upon these gone Let them affright thee <eos> I beseech thee youth Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury : O be gone <eos> By heaven I love thee better than myself For I come hither arm'd against myself : Stay not be gone live and hereafter say A madman's mercy bade thee run away <eos> PARIS : I do defy thy conjurations And apprehend thee for a felon here <eos> ROMEO : Wilt thou provoke me <eos> then have at thee boy <eos> PAGE : O Lord they fight <eos> I will go call the watch <eos> PARIS : O I am slain <eos> If thou be merciful Open the tomb lay me with Juliet <eos> ROMEO : In faith I will <eos> Let me peruse this face <eos> Mercutio's kinsman noble County Paris <eos> What said my man when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode <eos> I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet : Said he not so <eos> or did I dream it so <eos> Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet To think it was so <eos> O give me thy hand One writ with me in sour misfortune's book <eos> I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave A grave <eos> O no <eos> a lantern slaughter'd youth For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light <eos> Death lie thou there by a dead man interr'd <eos> How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry <eos> which their keepers call A lightning before death : O how may I Call this a lightning <eos> O my love <eos> my wife <eos> Death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty : Thou art not conquer'd beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks And death's pale flag is not advanced there <eos> Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet <eos> O what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy <eos> Forgive me cousin <eos> Ah dear Juliet Why art thou yet so fair <eos> shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour <eos> For fear of that I still will stay with thee And never from this palace of dim night Depart again : here here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber-maids O here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh <eos> Eyes look your last <eos> Arms take your last embrace <eos> and lips O you The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death <eos> Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide <eos> Thou desperate pilot now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark <eos> Here's to my love <eos> O true apothecary <eos> Thy drugs are quick <eos> Thus with a kiss I die <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Saint Francis be my speed <eos> how oft to-night Have my old feet stumbled at graves <eos> Who's there <eos> BALTHASAR : Here's one a friend and one that knows you well <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Bliss be upon you <eos> Tell me good my friend What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls <eos> as I discern It burneth in the Capel's monument <eos> BALTHASAR : It doth so holy sir and there's my master One that you love <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Who is it <eos> BALTHASAR : Romeo <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : How long hath he been there <eos> BALTHASAR : Full half an hour <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Go with me to the vault <eos> BALTHASAR : I dare not sir My master knows not but I am gone hence And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Stay then I'll go alone <eos> Fear comes upon me : O much I fear some ill unlucky thing <eos> BALTHASAR : As I did sleep under this yew-tree here I dreamt my master and another fought And that my master slew him <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : Romeo <eos> Alack alack what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre <eos> What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace <eos> Romeo <eos> O pale <eos> Who else <eos> what Paris too <eos> And steep'd in blood <eos> Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance <eos> The lady stirs <eos> JULIET : O comfortable friar <eos> where is my lord <eos> I do remember well where I should be And there I am <eos> Where is my Romeo <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : I hear some noise <eos> Lady come from that nest Of death contagion and unnatural sleep : A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents <eos> Come come away <eos> Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead And Paris too <eos> Come I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns : Stay not to question for the watch is coming Come go good Juliet I dare no longer stay <eos> JULIET : Go get thee hence for I will not away <eos> What's here <eos> a cup closed in my true love's hand <eos> Poison I see hath been his timeless end : O churl <eos> drunk all and left no friendly drop To help me after <eos> I will kiss thy lips Haply some poison yet doth hang on them To make die with a restorative <eos> Thy lips are warm <eos> First Watchman : JULIET : Yea noise <eos> then I'll be brief <eos> O happy dagger <eos> This is thy sheath there rust and let me die <eos> PAGE : This is the place there where the torch doth burn <eos> First Watchman : The ground is bloody search about the churchyard : Go some of you whoe'er you find attach <eos> Pitiful sight <eos> here lies the county slain And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead Who here hath lain these two days buried <eos> Go tell the prince : run to the Capulets : Raise up the Montagues : some others search : We see the ground whereon these woes do lie But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry <eos> Second Watchman : Here's Romeo's man we found him in the churchyard <eos> First Watchman : Hold him in safety till the prince come hither <eos> Third Watchman : Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps : We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side <eos> First Watchman : A great suspicion : stay the friar too <eos> PRINCE : What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning's rest <eos> CAPULET : What should it be that they so shriek abroad <eos> LADY CAPULET : The people in the street cry Romeo Some Juliet and some Paris and all run With open outcry toward our monument <eos> PRINCE : What fear is this which startles in our ears <eos> First Watchman : Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before Warm and new kill'd <eos> PRINCE : Search seek and know how this foul murder comes <eos> First Watchman : Here is a friar and slaughter'd Romeo's man With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men's tombs <eos> CAPULET : O heavens <eos> O wife look how our daughter bleeds <eos> This dagger hath mista'en <eos>for lo his house Is empty on the back of Montague <eos> And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom <eos> LADY CAPULET : O me <eos> this sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre <eos> PRINCE : Come Montague for thou art early up To see thy son and heir more early down <eos> MONTAGUE : Alas my liege my wife is dead to-night Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath : What further woe conspires against mine age <eos> PRINCE : Look and thou shalt see <eos> MONTAGUE : O thou untaught <eos> what manners is in this <eos> To press before thy father to a grave <eos> PRINCE : Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring their head their true descent And then will I be general of your woes And lead you even to death : meantime forbear And let mischance be slave to patience <eos> Bring forth the parties of suspicion <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : I am the greatest able to do least Yet most suspected as the time and place Doth make against me of this direful murder And here I stand both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excused <eos> PRINCE : Then say at once what thou dost know in this <eos> FRIAR LAURENCE : I will be brief for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale <eos> Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet And she there dead that Romeo's faithful wife : I married them and their stol'n marriage-day Was Tybalt's dooms-day whose untimely death Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pined <eos> You to remove that siege of grief from her Betroth'd and would have married her perforce To County Paris : then comes she to me And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage Or in my cell there would she kill herself <eos> Then gave I her so tutor'd by my art A sleeping potion which so took effect As I intended for it wrought on her The form of death : meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow'd grave Being the time the potion's force should cease <eos> But he which bore my letter Friar John Was stay'd by accident and yesternight Return'd my letter back <eos> Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred's vault Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo : But when I came some minute ere the time Of her awaking here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead <eos> She wakes and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience : But then a noise did scare me from the tomb And she too desperate would not go with me But as it seems did violence on herself <eos> All this I know and to the marriage Her nurse is privy : and if aught in this Miscarried by my fault let my old life Be sacrificed some hour before his time Unto the rigour of severest law <eos> PRINCE : We still have known thee for a holy man <eos> Where's Romeo's man <eos> what can he say in this <eos> BALTHASAR : I brought my master news of Juliet's death And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place to this same monument <eos> This letter he early bid me give his father And threatened me with death going in the vault I departed not and left him there <eos> PRINCE : Give me the letter I will look on it <eos> Where is the county's page that raised the watch <eos> Sirrah what made your master in this place <eos> PAGE : He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave And bid me stand aloof and so I did : Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb And by and by my master drew on him And then I ran away to call the watch <eos> PRINCE : This letter doth make good the friar's words Their course of love the tidings of her death : And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor 'pothecary and therewithal Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet <eos> Where be these enemies <eos> Capulet <eos> Montague <eos> See what a scourge is laid upon your hate That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love <eos> And I for winking at your discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen : all are punish'd <eos> CAPULET : O brother Montague give me thy hand : This is my daughter's jointure for no more Can I demand <eos> MONTAGUE : But I can give thee more : For I will raise her statue in pure gold That while Verona by that name is known There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet <eos> CAPULET : As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie Poor sacrifices of our enmity <eos> PRINCE : A glooming peace this morning with it brings The sun for sorrow will not show his head : Go hence to have more talk of these sad things Some shall be pardon'd and some punished : For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo <eos> WARWICK : I wonder how the king escaped our hands <eos> YORK : While we pursued the horsemen of the north He slily stole away and left his men : Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat Cheer'd up the drooping army and himself Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast Charged our main battle's front and breaking in Were by the swords of common soldiers slain <eos> EDWARD : Lord Stafford's father Duke of Buckingham Is either slain or wounded dangerously I cleft his beaver with a downright blow : That this is true father behold his blood <eos> MONTAGUE : And brother here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd <eos> RICHARD : Speak thou for me and tell them what I did <eos> YORK : Richard hath best deserved of all my sons <eos> But is your grace dead my Lord of Somerset <eos> NORFOLK : Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt <eos> RICHARD : Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head <eos> WARWICK : And so do I <eos> Victorious Prince of York Before I see thee seated in that throne Which now the house of Lancaster usurps I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close <eos> This is the palace of the fearful king And this the regal seat : possess it York For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs' YORK : Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will For hither we have broken in by force <eos> NORFOLK : We'll all assist you he that flies shall die <eos> YORK : Thanks gentle Norfolk : stay by me my lords And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night <eos> WARWICK : And when the king comes offer no violence Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce <eos> YORK : The queen this day here holds her parliament But little thinks we shall be of her council : By words or blows here let us win our right <eos> RICHARD : Arm'd as we are let's stay within this house <eos> WARWICK : The bloody parliament shall this be call'd Unless Plantagenet Duke of York be king And bashful Henry deposed whose cowardice Hath made us by-words to our enemies <eos> YORK : Then leave me not my lords be resolute I mean to take possession of my right <eos> WARWICK : Neither the king nor he that loves him best The proudest he that holds up Lancaster Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells <eos> I'll plant Plantagenet root him up who dares : Resolve thee Richard claim the English crown <eos> KING HENRY VI : My lords look where the sturdy rebel sits Even in the chair of state : belike he means Back'd by the power of Warwick that false peer To aspire unto the crown and reign as king <eos> Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father <eos> And thine Lord Clifford and you both have vow'd revenge On him his sons his favourites and his friends <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : If I be not heavens be revenged on me <eos> CLIFFORD : The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel <eos> WESTMORELAND : What shall we suffer this <eos> let's pluck him down : My heart for anger burns I cannot brook it <eos> KING HENRY VI : Be patient gentle Earl of Westmoreland <eos> CLIFFORD : Patience is for poltroons such as he : He durst not sit there had your father lived <eos> My gracious lord here in the parliament Let us assail the family of York <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Well hast thou spoken cousin : be it so <eos> KING HENRY VI : Ah know you not the city favours them And they have troops of soldiers at their beck <eos> EXETER : But when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly <eos> KING HENRY VI : Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart To make a shambles of the parliament-house <eos> Cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats Shall be the war that Henry means to use <eos> Thou factious Duke of York descend my throne and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet I am thy sovereign <eos> YORK : I am thine <eos> EXETER : For shame come down : he made thee Duke of York <eos> YORK : 'Twas my inheritance as the earldom was <eos> EXETER : Thy father was a traitor to the crown <eos> WARWICK : Exeter thou art a traitor to the crown In following this usurping Henry <eos> CLIFFORD : Whom should he follow but his natural king <eos> WARWICK : True Clifford and that's Richard Duke of York <eos> KING HENRY VI : And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne <eos> YORK : It must and shall be so : content thyself <eos> WARWICK : Be Duke of Lancaster let him be king <eos> WESTMORELAND : He is both king and Duke of Lancaster And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain <eos> WARWICK : And Warwick shall disprove it <eos> You forget That we are those which chased you from the field And slew your fathers and with colours spread March'd through the city to the palace gates <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Yes Warwick I remember it to my grief And by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it <eos> WESTMORELAND : Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons Thy kinsman and thy friends I'll have more lives Than drops of blood were in my father's veins <eos> CLIFFORD : Urge it no more lest that instead of words I send thee Warwick such a messenger As shall revenge his death before I stir <eos> WARWICK : Poor Clifford <eos> how I scorn his worthless threats <eos> YORK : Will you we show our title to the crown <eos> If not our swords shall plead it in the field <eos> KING HENRY VI : What title hast thou traitor to the crown <eos> Thy father was as thou art Duke of York Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March : I am the son of Henry the Fifth Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop And seized upon their towns and provinces <eos> WARWICK : Talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all <eos> KING HENRY VI : The lord protector lost it and not I : When I was crown'd I was but nine months old <eos> RICHARD : You are old enough now and yet methinks you lose <eos> Father tear the crown from the usurper's head <eos> EDWARD : Sweet father do so set it on your head <eos> MONTAGUE : Good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus <eos> RICHARD : Sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly <eos> YORK : Sons peace <eos> KING HENRY VI : Peace thou <eos> and give King Henry leave to speak <eos> WARWICK : Plantagenet shall speak first : hear him lords And be you silent and attentive too For he that interrupts him shall not live <eos> KING HENRY VI : Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne Wherein my grandsire and my father sat <eos> No : first shall war unpeople this my realm Ay and their colours often borne in France And now in England to our heart's great sorrow Shall be my winding-sheet <eos> Why faint you lords <eos> My title's good and better far than his <eos> WARWICK : Prove it Henry and thou shalt be king <eos> KING HENRY VI : Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown <eos> YORK : 'Twas by rebellion against his king <eos> KING HENRY VI : YORK : What then <eos> KING HENRY VI : An if he may then am I lawful king For Richard in the view of many lords Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth Whose heir my father was and I am his <eos> YORK : He rose against him being his sovereign And made him to resign his crown perforce <eos> WARWICK : Suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown <eos> EXETER : No for he could not so resign his crown But that the next heir should succeed and reign <eos> KING HENRY VI : Art thou against us Duke of Exeter <eos> EXETER : His is the right and therefore pardon me <eos> YORK : Why whisper you my lords and answer not <eos> EXETER : My conscience tells me he is lawful king <eos> KING HENRY VI : NORTHUMBERLAND : Plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st Think not that Henry shall be so deposed <eos> WARWICK : Deposed he shall be in despite of all <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Thou art deceived : 'tis not thy southern power Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud Can set the duke up in despite of me <eos> CLIFFORD : King Henry be thy title right or wrong Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence : May that ground gape and swallow me alive Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father <eos> KING HENRY VI : O Clifford how thy words revive my heart <eos> YORK : Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown <eos> What mutter you or what conspire you lords <eos> WARWICK : Do right unto this princely Duke of York Or I will fill the house with armed men And over the chair of state where now he sits Write up his title with usurping blood <eos> KING HENRY VI : My Lord of Warwick hear me but one word : Let me for this my life-time reign as king <eos> YORK : Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest <eos> KING HENRY VI : I am content : Richard Plantagenet Enjoy the kingdom after my decease <eos> CLIFFORD : What wrong is this unto the prince your son <eos> WARWICK : What good is this to England and himself <eos> WESTMORELAND : Base fearful and despairing Henry <eos> CLIFFORD : How hast thou injured both thyself and us <eos> WESTMORELAND : I cannot stay to hear these articles <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Nor I <eos> CLIFFORD : Come cousin let us tell the queen these news <eos> WESTMORELAND : Farewell faint-hearted and degenerate king In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Be thou a prey unto the house of York And die in bands for this unmanly deed <eos> CLIFFORD : In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome Or live in peace abandon'd and despised <eos> WARWICK : Turn this way Henry and regard them not <eos> EXETER : They seek revenge and therefore will not yield <eos> KING HENRY VI : Ah Exeter <eos> WARWICK : Why should you sigh my lord <eos> KING HENRY VI : Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit <eos> But be it as it may : I here entail The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever Conditionally that here thou take an oath To cease this civil war and whilst I live To honour me as thy king and sovereign And neither by treason nor hostility To seek to put me down and reign thyself <eos> YORK : This oath I willingly take and will perform <eos> WARWICK : Long live King Henry <eos> Plantagenet embrace him <eos> KING HENRY VI : And long live thou and these thy forward sons <eos> YORK : Now York and Lancaster are reconciled <eos> EXETER : Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes <eos> YORK : Farewell my gracious lord I'll to my castle <eos> WARWICK : And I'll keep London with my soldiers <eos> NORFOLK : And I to Norfolk with my followers <eos> MONTAGUE : And I unto the sea from whence I came <eos> KING HENRY VI : And I with grief and sorrow to the court <eos> EXETER : Here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger : I'll steal away <eos> KING HENRY VI : Exeter so will I <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Nay go not from me I will follow thee <eos> KING HENRY VI : Be patient gentle queen and I will stay <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Who can be patient in such extremes <eos> Ah wretched man <eos> would I had died a maid And never seen thee never borne thee son Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus <eos> Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I Or felt that pain which I did for him once Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there Rather than have that savage duke thine heir And disinherited thine only son <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Father you cannot disinherit me : If you be king why should not I succeed <eos> KING HENRY VI : Pardon me Margaret pardon me sweet son : The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Enforced thee <eos> art thou king and wilt be forced <eos> I shame to hear thee speak <eos> Ah timorous wretch <eos> Thou hast undone thyself thy son and me And given unto the house of York such head As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance <eos> To entail him and his heirs unto the crown What is it but to make thy sepulchre And creep into it far before thy time <eos> Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas The duke is made protector of the realm And yet shalt thou be safe <eos> such safety finds The trembling lamb environed with wolves <eos> Had I been there which am a silly woman The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes Before I would have granted to that act <eos> But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour : And seeing thou dost I here divorce myself Both from thy table Henry and thy bed Until that act of parliament be repeal'd Whereby my son is disinherited <eos> The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours Will follow mine if once they see them spread And spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace And utter ruin of the house of York <eos> Thus do I leave thee <eos> Come son let's away Our army is ready come we'll after them <eos> KING HENRY VI : Stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Thou hast spoke too much already : get thee gone <eos> KING HENRY VI : Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Ay to be murder'd by his enemies <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : When I return with victory from the field I'll see your grace : till then I'll follow her <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Come son away we may not linger thus <eos> KING HENRY VI : Poor queen <eos> how love to me and to her son Hath made her break out into terms of rage <eos> Revenged may she be on that hateful duke Whose haughty spirit winged with desire Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle Tire on the flesh of me and of my son <eos> The loss of those three lords torments my heart : I'll write unto them and entreat them fair <eos> Come cousin you shall be the messenger <eos> EXETER : And I I hope shall reconcile them all <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI RICHARD : Brother though I be youngest give me leave <eos> EDWARD : No I can better play the orator <eos> MONTAGUE : But I have reasons strong and forcible <eos> YORK : Why how now sons and brother <eos> at a strife <eos> What is your quarrel <eos> how began it first <eos> EDWARD : No quarrel but a slight contention <eos> YORK : About what <eos> RICHARD : About that which concerns your grace and us The crown of England father which is yours <eos> YORK : Mine boy <eos> not till King Henry be dead <eos> RICHARD : Your right depends not on his life or death <eos> EDWARD : Now you are heir therefore enjoy it now : By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe It will outrun you father in the end <eos> YORK : I took an oath that he should quietly reign <eos> EDWARD : But for a kingdom any oath may be broken : I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year <eos> RICHARD : No God forbid your grace should be forsworn <eos> YORK : I shall be if I claim by open war <eos> RICHARD : I'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak <eos> YORK : Thou canst not son it is impossible <eos> RICHARD : An oath is of no moment being not took Before a true and lawful magistrate That hath authority over him that swears : Henry had none but did usurp the place Then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous <eos> Therefore to arms <eos> And father do but think How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown Within whose circuit is Elysium And all that poets feign of bliss and joy <eos> Why do we finger thus <eos> I cannot rest Until the white rose that I wear be dyed Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart <eos> YORK : Richard enough I will be king or die <eos> Brother thou shalt to London presently And whet on Warwick to this enterprise <eos> Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk And tell him privily of our intent <eos> You Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise : In them I trust for they are soldiers Witty courteous liberal full of spirit <eos> While you are thus employ'd what resteth more But that I seek occasion how to rise And yet the king not privy to my drift Nor any of the house of Lancaster <eos> But stay : what news <eos> Why comest thou in such post <eos> Messenger : The queen with all the northern earls and lords Intend here to besiege you in your castle : She is hard by with twenty thousand men And therefore fortify your hold my lord <eos> YORK : Ay with my sword <eos> What <eos> think'st thou that we fear them <eos> Edward and Richard you shall stay with me My brother Montague shall post to London : Let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest Whom we have left protectors of the king With powerful policy strengthen themselves And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths <eos> MONTAGUE : Brother I go I'll win them fear it not : And thus most humbly I do take my leave <eos> Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles You are come to Sandal in a happy hour The army of the queen mean to besiege us <eos> JOHN MORTIMER : She shall not need we'll meet her in the field <eos> YORK : What with five thousand men <eos> RICHARD : Ay with five hundred father for a need : A woman's general what should we fear <eos> EDWARD : I hear their drums : let's set our men in order And issue forth and bid them battle straight <eos> YORK : Five men to twenty <eos> though the odds be great I doubt not uncle of our victory <eos> Many a battle have I won in France When as the enemy hath been ten to one : Why should I not now have the like success <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI RUTLAND : Ah whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands <eos> Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes <eos> CLIFFORD : Chaplain away <eos> thy priesthood saves thy life <eos> As for the brat of this accursed duke Whose father slew my father he shall die <eos> Tutor : And I my lord will bear him company <eos> CLIFFORD : Soldiers away with him <eos> Tutor : Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child Lest thou be hated both of God and man <eos> CLIFFORD : How now <eos> is he dead already <eos> or is it fear That makes him close his eyes <eos> I'll open them <eos> RUTLAND : So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch That trembles under his devouring paws And so he walks insulting o'er his prey And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder <eos> Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword And not with such a cruel threatening look <eos> Sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die <eos> I am too mean a subject for thy wrath : Be thou revenged on men and let me live <eos> CLIFFORD : In vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter <eos> RUTLAND : Then let my father's blood open it again : He is a man and Clifford cope with him <eos> CLIFFORD : Had thy brethren here their lives and thine Were not revenge sufficient for me No if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves And hung their rotten coffins up in chains It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart <eos> The sight of any of the house of York Is as a fury to torment my soul And till I root out their accursed line And leave not one alive I live in hell <eos> Therefore <eos> RUTLAND : O let me pray before I take my death <eos> To thee I pray sweet Clifford pity me <eos> CLIFFORD : Such pity as my rapier's point affords <eos> RUTLAND : I never did thee harm : why wilt thou slay me <eos> CLIFFORD : Thy father hath <eos> RUTLAND : But 'twas ere I was born <eos> Thou hast one son for his sake pity me Lest in revenge thereof sith God is just He be as miserably slain as I <eos> Ah let me live in prison all my days And when I give occasion of offence Then let me die for now thou hast no cause <eos> CLIFFORD : No cause <eos> Thy father slew my father therefore die <eos> RUTLAND : Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae <eos> CLIFFORD : Plantagenet <eos> I come Plantagenet <eos> And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood Congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI YORK : The army of the queen hath got the field : My uncles both are slain in rescuing me And all my followers to the eager foe Turn back and fly like ships before the wind Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves <eos> My sons God knows what hath bechanced them : But this I know they have demean'd themselves Like men born to renown by life or death <eos> Three times did Richard make a lane to me <eos> And thrice cried 'Courage father <eos> fight it out <eos>' And full as oft came Edward to my side With purple falchion painted to the hilt In blood of those that had encounter'd him : And when the hardiest warriors did retire Richard cried 'Charge <eos> and give no foot of ground <eos>' And cried 'A crown or else a glorious tomb <eos> A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre <eos>' With this we charged again : but out alas <eos> We bodged again as I have seen a swan With bootless labour swim against the tide And spend her strength with over-matching waves <eos> Ah hark <eos> the fatal followers do pursue And I am faint and cannot fly their fury : And were I strong I would not shun their fury : The sands are number'd that make up my life Here must I stay and here my life must end <eos> Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland I dare your quenchless fury to more rage : I am your butt and I abide your shot <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet <eos> CLIFFORD : Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm With downright payment show'd unto my father <eos> Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car And made an evening at the noontide prick <eos> YORK : My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth A bird that will revenge upon you all : And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with <eos> Why come you not <eos> what <eos> multitudes and fear <eos> CLIFFORD : So cowards fight when they can fly no further So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers <eos> YORK : O Clifford but bethink thee once again And in thy thought o'er-run my former time And if though canst for blushing view this face And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this <eos> CLIFFORD : I will not bandy with thee word for word But buckle with thee blows twice two for one <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Hold valiant Clifford <eos> for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitor's life <eos> Wrath makes him deaf : speak thou Northumberland <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Hold Clifford <eos> do not honour him so much To prick thy finger though to wound his heart : What valour were it when a cur doth grin For one to thrust his hand between his teeth When he might spurn him with his foot away <eos> It is war's prize to take all vantages And ten to one is no impeach of valour <eos> CLIFFORD : Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : So doth the cony struggle in the net <eos> YORK : So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty So true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : What would your grace have done unto him now <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland Come make him stand upon this molehill here That raught at mountains with outstretched arms Yet parted but the shadow with his hand <eos> What <eos> was it you that would be England's king <eos> Was't you that revell'd in our parliament And made a preachment of your high descent <eos> Where are your mess of sons to back you now <eos> The wanton Edward and the lusty George <eos> And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies <eos> Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland <eos> Look York : I stain'd this napkin with the blood That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point Made issue from the bosom of the boy And if thine eyes can water for his death I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal <eos> Alas poor York <eos> but that I hate thee deadly I should lament thy miserable state <eos> I prithee grieve to make me merry York <eos> What hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death <eos> Why art thou patient man <eos> thou shouldst be mad And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus <eos> Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance <eos> Thou wouldst be fee'd I see to make me sport : York cannot speak unless he wear a crown <eos> A crown for York <eos> and lords bow low to him : Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on <eos> Ay marry sir now looks he like a king <eos> Ay this is he that took King Henry's chair And this is he was his adopted heir <eos> But how is it that great Plantagenet Is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath <eos> As I bethink me you should not be king Till our King Henry had shook hands with death <eos> And will you pale your head in Henry's glory And rob his temples of the diadem Now in his life against your holy oath <eos> O 'tis a fault too too unpardonable <eos> Off with the crown and with the crown his head And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead <eos> CLIFFORD : That is my office for my father's sake <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes <eos> YORK : She-wolf of France but worse than wolves of France Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth <eos> How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex To triumph like an Amazonian trull Upon their woes whom fortune captivates <eos> But that thy face is vizard-like unchanging Made impudent with use of evil deeds I would assay proud queen to make thee blush <eos> To tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless <eos> Thy father bears the type of King of Naples Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman <eos> Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult <eos> It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen Unless the adage must be verified That beggars mounted run their horse to death <eos> 'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud But God he knows thy share thereof is small : 'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at : 'Tis government that makes them seem divine The want thereof makes thee abominable : Thou art as opposite to every good As the Antipodes are unto us Or as the south to the septentrion <eos> O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide <eos> How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child To bid the father wipe his eyes withal And yet be seen to bear a woman's face <eos> Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless <eos> Bids't thou me rage <eos> why now thou hast thy wish : Wouldst have me weep <eos> why now thou hast thy will : For raging wind blows up incessant showers And when the rage allays the rain begins <eos> These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies : And every drop cries vengeance for his death 'Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Beshrew me but his passion moves me so That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears <eos> YORK : That face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood : But you are more inhuman more inexorable O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania <eos> See ruthless queen a hapless father's tears : This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy And I with tears do wash the blood away <eos> Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this : And if thou tell'st the heavy story right Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears And say 'Alas it was a piteous deed <eos>' There take the crown and with the crown my curse And in thy need such comfort come to thee As now I reap at thy too cruel hand <eos> Hard-hearted Clifford take me from the world : My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin I should not for my life but weep with him <eos> To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : What weeping-ripe my Lord Northumberland <eos> Think but upon the wrong he did us all And that will quickly dry thy melting tears <eos> CLIFFORD : Here's for my oath here's for my father's death <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : And here's to right our gentle-hearted king <eos> YORK : Open Thy gate of mercy gracious God <eos> My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Off with his head and set it on York gates So York may overlook the town of York <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI EDWARD : I wonder how our princely father 'scaped Or whether he be 'scaped away or no From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit : Had he been ta'en we should have heard the news Had he been slain we should have heard the news Or had he 'scaped methinks we should have heard The happy tidings of his good escape <eos> How fares my brother <eos> why is he so sad <eos> RICHARD : I cannot joy until I be resolved Where our right valiant father is become <eos> I saw him in the battle range about And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth <eos> Methought he bore him in the thickest troop As doth a lion in a herd of neat Or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry The rest stand all aloof and bark at him <eos> So fared our father with his enemies So fled his enemies my warlike father : Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son <eos> See how the morning opes her golden gates And takes her farewell of the glorious sun <eos> How well resembles it the prime of youth Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love <eos> EDWARD : Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns <eos> RICHARD : Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun Not separated with the racking clouds But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky <eos> See see <eos> they join embrace and seem to kiss As if they vow'd some league inviolable : Now are they but one lamp one light one sun <eos> In this the heaven figures some event <eos> EDWARD : 'Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of <eos> I think it cites us brother to the field That we the sons of brave Plantagenet Each one already blazing by our meeds Should notwithstanding join our lights together And over-shine the earth as this the world <eos> Whate'er it bodes henceforward will I bear Upon my target three fair-shining suns <eos> RICHARD : Nay bear three daughters : by your leave I speak it You love the breeder better than the male <eos> But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue <eos> Messenger : Ah one that was a woful looker-on When as the noble Duke of York was slain Your princely father and my loving lord <eos> EDWARD : O speak no more for I have heard too much <eos> RICHARD : Say how he died for I will hear it all <eos> Messenger : Environed he was with many foes And stood against them as the hope of Troy Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy <eos> But Hercules himself must yield to odds And many strokes though with a little axe Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak <eos> By many hands your father was subdued But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite Laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain : And after many scorns many foul taunts They took his head and on the gates of York They set the same and there it doth remain The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd <eos> EDWARD : Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay <eos> O Clifford boisterous Clifford <eos> thou hast slain The flower of Europe for his chivalry And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee <eos> Now my soul's palace is become a prison : Ah would she break from hence that this my body Might in the ground be closed up in rest <eos> For never henceforth shall I joy again Never O never shall I see more joy <eos> RICHARD : I cannot weep for all my body's moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart : Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen For selfsame wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast And burns me up with flames that tears would quench <eos> To weep is to make less the depth of grief : Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me Richard I bear thy name I'll venge thy death Or die renowned by attempting it <eos> EDWARD : His name that valiant duke hath left with thee His dukedom and his chair with me is left <eos> RICHARD : Nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun : For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say Either that is thine or else thou wert not his <eos> WARWICK : How now fair lords <eos> What fare <eos> what news abroad <eos> RICHARD : Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told The words would add more anguish than the wounds <eos> O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain <eos> EDWARD : O Warwick Warwick <eos> that Plantagenet Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death <eos> WARWICK : Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears And now to add more measure to your woes I come to tell you things sith then befall'n <eos> After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run Were brought me of your loss and his depart <eos> I then in London keeper of the king Muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends And very well appointed as I thought March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen Bearing the king in my behalf along For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in parliament Touching King Henry's oath and your succession <eos> Short tale to make we at Saint Alban's met Our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought : But whether 'twas the coldness of the king Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen Or whether 'twas report of her success Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour Who thunders to his captives blood and death I cannot judge : but to conclude with truth Their weapons like to lightning came and went Our soldiers' like the night-owl's lazy flight Or like an idle thresher with a flail Fell gently down as if they struck their friends <eos> I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause With promise of high pay and great rewards : But all in vain they had no heart to fight And we in them no hope to win the day So that we fled the king unto the queen Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself In haste post-haste are come to join with you : For in the marches here we heard you were Making another head to fight again <eos> EDWARD : Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick <eos> And when came George from Burgundy to England <eos> WARWICK : Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers And for your brother he was lately sent From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy With aid of soldiers to this needful war <eos> RICHARD : 'Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled : Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit But ne'er till now his scandal of retire <eos> WARWICK : Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head And wring the awful sceptre from his fist Were he as famous and as bold in war As he is famed for mildness peace and prayer <eos> RICHARD : I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not : 'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak <eos> But in this troublous time what's to be done <eos> Shall we go throw away our coats of steel And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads <eos> Or shall we on the helmets of our foes Tell our devotion with revengeful arms <eos> If for the last say ay and to it lords <eos> WARWICK : Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out And therefore comes my brother Montague <eos> Attend me lords <eos> The proud insulting queen With Clifford and the haught Northumberland And of their feather many more proud birds Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax <eos> He swore consent to your succession His oath enrolled in the parliament And now to London all the crew are gone To frustrate both his oath and what beside May make against the house of Lancaster <eos> Their power I think is thirty thousand strong : Now if the help of Norfolk and myself With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure Will but amount to five and twenty thousand Why Via <eos> to London will we march amain And once again bestride our foaming steeds And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes <eos>' But never once again turn back and fly <eos> RICHARD : Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak : Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day That cries 'Retire' if Warwick bid him stay <eos> EDWARD : Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean And when thou fail'st <eos>as God forbid the hour <eos> <eos> Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend <eos> WARWICK : No longer Earl of March but Duke of York : The next degree is England's royal throne For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd In every borough as we pass along And he that throws not up his cap for joy Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head <eos> King Edward valiant Richard Montague Stay we no longer dreaming of renown But sound the trumpets and about our task <eos> RICHARD : Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds I come to pierce it or to give thee mine <eos> EDWARD : Then strike up drums : God and Saint George for us <eos> WARWICK : How now <eos> what news <eos> Messenger : The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me The queen is coming with a puissant host And craves your company for speedy counsel <eos> WARWICK : Why then it sorts brave warriors let's away <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET : Welcome my lord to this brave town of York <eos> Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy That sought to be encompass'd with your crown : Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord <eos> KING HENRY VI : Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck : To see this sight it irks my very soul <eos> Withhold revenge dear God <eos> 'tis not my fault Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow <eos> CLIFFORD : My gracious liege this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside <eos> To whom do lions cast their gentle looks <eos> Not to the beast that would usurp their den <eos> Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick <eos> Not his that spoils her young before her face <eos> Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting <eos> Not he that sets his foot upon her back <eos> The smallest worm will turn being trodden on And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood <eos> Ambitious York doth level at thy crown Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows : He but a duke would have his son a king And raise his issue like a loving sire Thou being a king blest with a goodly son Didst yield consent to disinherit him Which argued thee a most unloving father <eos> Unreasonable creatures feed their young And though man's face be fearful to their eyes Yet in protection of their tender ones Who hath not seen them even with those wings Which sometime they have used with fearful flight Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest Offer their own lives in their young's defence <eos> For shame my liege make them your precedent <eos> Were it not pity that this goodly boy Should lose his birthright by his father's fault And long hereafter say unto his child 'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got My careless father fondly gave away' <eos> Ah what a shame were this <eos> Look on the boy And let his manly face which promiseth Successful fortune steel thy melting heart To hold thine own and leave thine own with him <eos> KING HENRY VI : Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator Inferring arguments of mighty force <eos> But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear That things ill-got had ever bad success <eos> And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell <eos> I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind And would my father had left me no more <eos> For all the rest is held at such a rate As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep Than in possession and jot of pleasure <eos> Ah cousin York <eos> would thy best friends did know How it doth grieve me that thy head is here <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : My lord cheer up your spirits : our foes are nigh And this soft courage makes your followers faint <eos> You promised knighthood to our forward son : Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently <eos> Edward kneel down <eos> KING HENRY VI : Edward Plantagenet arise a knight And learn this lesson draw thy sword in right <eos> PRINCE : My gracious father by your kingly leave I'll draw it as apparent to the crown And in that quarrel use it to the death <eos> CLIFFORD : Why that is spoken like a toward prince <eos> Messenger : Royal commanders be in readiness : For with a band of thirty thousand men Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York And in the towns as they do march along Proclaims him king and many fly to him : Darraign your battle for they are at hand <eos> CLIFFORD : I would your highness would depart the field : The queen hath best success when you are absent <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune <eos> KING HENRY VI : Why that's my fortune too therefore I'll stay <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : Be it with resolution then to fight <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : My royal father cheer these noble lords And hearten those that fight in your defence : Unsheathe your sword good father cry 'Saint George <eos>' EDWARD : Now perjured Henry <eos> wilt thou kneel for grace And set thy diadem upon my head Or bide the mortal fortune of the field <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy <eos> Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king <eos> EDWARD : I am his king and he should bow his knee I was adopted heir by his consent : Since when his oath is broke for as I hear You that are king though he do wear the crown Have caused him by new act of parliament To blot out me and put his own son in <eos> CLIFFORD : And reason too : Who should succeed the father but the son <eos> RICHARD : Are you there butcher <eos> O I cannot speak <eos> CLIFFORD : Ay crook-back here I stand to answer thee Or any he the proudest of thy sort <eos> RICHARD : 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland was it not <eos> CLIFFORD : Ay and old York and yet not satisfied <eos> RICHARD : For God's sake lords give signal to the fight <eos> WARWICK : What say'st thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Why how now long-tongued Warwick <eos> dare you speak <eos> When you and I met at Saint Alban's last Your legs did better service than your hands <eos> WARWICK : Then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine <eos> CLIFFORD : You said so much before and yet you fled <eos> WARWICK : 'Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence <eos> NORTHUMBERLAND : No nor your manhood that durst make you stay <eos> RICHARD : Northumberland I hold thee reverently <eos> Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain The execution of my big-swoln heart Upon that Clifford that cruel child-killer <eos> CLIFFORD : I slew thy father call'st thou him a child <eos> RICHARD : Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed <eos> KING HENRY VI : Have done with words my lords and hear me speak <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Defy them then or else hold close thy lips <eos> KING HENRY VI : I prithee give no limits to my tongue : I am a king and privileged to speak <eos> CLIFFORD : My liege the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cured by words therefore be still <eos> RICHARD : Then executioner unsheathe thy sword : By him that made us all I am resolved that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue <eos> EDWARD : Say Henry shall I have my right or no <eos> A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown <eos> WARWICK : If thou deny their blood upon thy head For York in justice puts his armour on <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : If that be right which Warwick says is right There is no wrong but every thing is right <eos> RICHARD : Whoever got thee there thy mother stands For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings <eos> RICHARD : Iron of Naples hid with English gilt Whose father bears the title of a king <eos> As if a channel should be call'd the sea <eos> Shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart <eos> EDWARD : A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns To make this shameless callet know herself <eos> Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou Although thy husband may be Menelaus And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd By that false woman as this king by thee <eos> His father revell'd in the heart of France And tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop And had he match'd according to his state He might have kept that glory to this day But when he took a beggar to his bed And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France And heap'd sedition on his crown at home <eos> For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride <eos> Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept And we in pity of the gentle king Had slipp'd our claim until another age <eos> GEORGE : But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring And that thy summer bred us no increase We set the axe to thy usurping root And though the edge hath something hit ourselves Yet know thou since we have begun to strike We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods <eos> EDWARD : And in this resolution I defy thee Not willing any longer conference Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak <eos> Sound trumpets <eos> let our bloody colours wave <eos> And either victory or else a grave <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Stay Edward <eos> EDWARD : No wrangling woman we'll no longer stay : These words will cost ten thousand lives this day <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI WARWICK : Forspent with toil as runners with a race I lay me down a little while to breathe For strokes received and many blows repaid Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile <eos> EDWARD : Smile gentle heaven <eos> or strike ungentle death <eos> For this world frowns and Edward's sun is clouded <eos> WARWICK : How now my lord <eos> what hap <eos> what hope of good <eos> GEORGE : Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us : What counsel give you <eos> whither shall we fly <eos> EDWARD : Bootless is flight they follow us with wings And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit <eos> RICHARD : Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself <eos> Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance And in the very pangs of death he cried Like to a dismal clangour heard from far 'Warwick revenge <eos> brother revenge my death <eos>' So underneath the belly of their steeds That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood The noble gentleman gave up the ghost <eos> WARWICK : Then let the earth be drunken with our blood : I'll kill my horse because I will not fly <eos> Why stand we like soft-hearted women here Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage And look upon as if the tragedy Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors <eos> Here on my knee I vow to God above I'll never pause again never stand still Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine Or fortune given me measure of revenge <eos> EDWARD : O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine And in this vow do chain my soul to thine <eos> And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee Thou setter up and plucker down of kings Beseeching thee if with they will it stands That to my foes this body must be prey Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope And give sweet passage to my sinful soul <eos> Now lords take leave until we meet again Where'er it be in heaven or in earth <eos> RICHARD : Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick Let me embrace thee in my weary arms : I that did never weep now melt with woe That winter should cut off our spring-time so <eos> WARWICK : Away away <eos> Once more sweet lords farewell <eos> GEORGE : Yet let us all together to our troops And give them leave to fly that will not stay And call them pillars that will stand to us And if we thrive promise them such rewards As victors wear at the Olympian games : This may plant courage in their quailing breasts For yet is hope of life and victory <eos> Forslow no longer make we hence amain <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI RICHARD : Now Clifford I have singled thee alone : Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York And this for Rutland both bound to revenge Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall <eos> CLIFFORD : Now Richard I am with thee here alone : This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland And here's the heart that triumphs in their death And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother To execute the like upon thyself And so have at thee <eos> RICHARD : Nay Warwick single out some other chase For I myself will hunt this wolf to death <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING HENRY VI : This battle fares like to the morning's war When dying clouds contend with growing light What time the shepherd blowing of his nails Can neither call it perfect day nor night <eos> Now sways it this way like a mighty sea Forced by the tide to combat with the wind Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea Forced to retire by fury of the wind : Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind Now one the better then another best Both tugging to be victors breast to breast Yet neither conqueror nor conquered : So is the equal of this fell war <eos> Here on this molehill will I sit me down <eos> To whom God will there be the victory <eos> For Margaret my queen and Clifford too Have chid me from the battle swearing both They prosper best of all when I am thence <eos> Would I were dead <eos> if God's good will were so For what is in this world but grief and woe <eos> O God <eos> methinks it were a happy life To be no better than a homely swain To sit upon a hill as I do now To carve out dials quaintly point by point Thereby to see the minutes how they run How many make the hour full complete How many hours bring about the day How many days will finish up the year How many years a mortal man may live <eos> When this is known then to divide the times : So many hours must I tend my flock So many hours must I take my rest So many hours must I contemplate So many hours must I sport myself So many days my ewes have been with young So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean : So many years ere I shall shear the fleece : So minutes hours days months and years Pass'd over to the end they were created Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave <eos> Ah what a life were this <eos> how sweet <eos> how lovely <eos> Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy To kings that fear their subjects' treachery <eos> O yes it doth a thousand-fold it doth <eos> And to conclude the shepherd's homely curds His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle <eos> His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade All which secure and sweetly he enjoys Is far beyond a prince's delicates His viands sparkling in a golden cup His body couched in a curious bed When care mistrust and treason waits on him <eos> Son : Ill blows the wind that profits nobody <eos> This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight May be possessed with some store of crowns And I that haply take them from him now May yet ere night yield both my life and them To some man else as this dead man doth me <eos> Who's this <eos> O God <eos> it is my father's face Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd <eos> O heavy times begetting such events <eos> From London by the king was I press'd forth My father being the Earl of Warwick's man Came on the part of York press'd by his master And I who at his hands received my life him Have by my hands of life bereaved him <eos> Pardon me God I knew not what I did <eos> And pardon father for I knew not thee <eos> My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks And no more words till they have flow'd their fill <eos> KING HENRY VI : O piteous spectacle <eos> O bloody times <eos> Whiles lions war and battle for their dens Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity <eos> Weep wretched man I'll aid thee tear for tear And let our hearts and eyes like civil war Be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief <eos> Father : Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold : For I have bought it with an hundred blows <eos> But let me see : is this our foeman's face <eos> Ah no no no it is mine only son <eos> Ah boy if any life be left in thee Throw up thine eye <eos> see see what showers arise Blown with the windy tempest of my heart Upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart <eos> O pity God this miserable age <eos> What stratagems how fell how butcherly Erroneous mutinous and unnatural This deadly quarrel daily doth beget <eos> O boy thy father gave thee life too soon And hath bereft thee of thy life too late <eos> KING HENRY VI : Woe above woe <eos> grief more than common grief <eos> O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds <eos> O pity pity gentle heaven pity <eos> The red rose and the white are on his face The fatal colours of our striving houses : The one his purple blood right well resembles The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth : Wither one rose and let the other flourish If you contend a thousand lives must wither <eos> Son : How will my mother for a father's death Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied <eos> Father : How will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied <eos> KING HENRY VI : How will the country for these woful chances Misthink the king and not be satisfied <eos> Son : Was ever son so rued a father's death <eos> Father : Was ever father so bemoan'd his son <eos> KING HENRY VI : Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe <eos> Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much <eos> Son : I'll bear thee hence where I may weep my fill <eos> Father : These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell And so obsequious will thy father be Even for the loss of thee having no more As Priam was for all his valiant sons <eos> I'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will For I have murdered where I should not kill <eos> KING HENRY VI : Sad-hearted men much overgone with care Here sits a king more woful than you are <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Fly father fly <eos> for all your friends are fled And Warwick rages like a chafed bull : Away <eos> for death doth hold us in pursuit <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain : Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds Having the fearful flying hare in sight With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands Are at our backs and therefore hence amain <eos> EXETER : Away <eos> for vengeance comes along with them : Nay stay not to expostulate make speed Or else come after : I'll away before <eos> KING HENRY VI : Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter : Not that I fear to stay but love to go Whither the queen intends <eos> Forward away <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI CLIFFORD : Here burns my candle out ay here it dies Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light <eos> O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow More than my body's parting with my soul <eos> My love and fear glued many friends to thee And now I fall thy tough commixture melts <eos> Impairing Henry strengthening misproud York The common people swarm like summer flies And whither fly the gnats but to the sun <eos> And who shines now but Henry's enemies <eos> O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth <eos> And Henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do Or as thy father and his father did Giving no ground unto the house of York They never then had sprung like summer flies I and ten thousand in this luckless realm Had left no mourning widows for our death And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace <eos> For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air <eos> And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity <eos> Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight : The foe is merciless and will not pity For at their hands I have deserved no pity <eos> The air hath got into my deadly wounds And much effuse of blood doth make me faint <eos> Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms split my breast <eos> EDWARD : Now breathe we lords : good fortune bids us pause And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks <eos> Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen That led calm Henry though he were a king As doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust Command an argosy to stem the waves <eos> But think you lords that Clifford fled with them <eos> WARWICK : No 'tis impossible he should escape For though before his face I speak the words Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave : And wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead <eos> EDWARD : Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave <eos> RICHARD : A deadly groan like life and death's departing <eos> EDWARD : See who it is : and now the battle's ended If friend or foe let him be gently used <eos> RICHARD : Revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis Clifford Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth But set his murdering knife unto the root From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring I mean our princely father Duke of York <eos> WARWICK : From off the gates of York fetch down the head Your father's head which Clifford placed there Instead whereof let this supply the room : Measure for measure must be answered <eos> EDWARD : Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house That nothing sung but death to us and ours : Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak <eos> WARWICK : I think his understanding is bereft <eos> Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee <eos> Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life And he nor sees nor hears us what we say <eos> RICHARD : O would he did <eos> and so perhaps he doth : 'Tis but his policy to counterfeit Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our father <eos> GEORGE : If so thou think'st vex him with eager words <eos> RICHARD : Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace <eos> EDWARD : Clifford repent in bootless penitence <eos> WARWICK : Clifford devise excuses for thy faults <eos> GEORGE : While we devise fell tortures for thy faults <eos> RICHARD : Thou didst love York and I am son to York <eos> EDWARD : Thou pitied'st Rutland I will pity thee <eos> GEORGE : Where's Captain Margaret to fence you now <eos> WARWICK : They mock thee Clifford : swear as thou wast wont <eos> RICHARD : What not an oath <eos> nay then the world goes hard When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath <eos> I know by that he's dead and by my soul If this right hand would buy two hour's life That I in all despite might rail at him This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst York and young Rutland could not satisfy <eos> WARWICK : Ay but he's dead : off with the traitor's head And rear it in the place your father's stands <eos> And now to London with triumphant march There to be crowned England's royal king : From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen : So shalt thou sinew both these lands together And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears <eos> First will I see the coronation And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea To effect this marriage so it please my lord <eos> EDWARD : Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be For in thy shoulder do I build my seat And never will I undertake the thing Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting <eos> Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester And George of Clarence : Warwick as ourself Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best <eos> RICHARD : Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous <eos> WARWICK : Tut that's a foolish observation : Richard be Duke of Gloucester <eos> Now to London To see these honours in possession <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI First Keeper : Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves For through this laund anon the deer will come And in this covert will we make our stand Culling the principal of all the deer <eos> Second Keeper : I'll stay above the hill so both may shoot <eos> First Keeper : That cannot be the noise of thy cross-bow Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost <eos> Here stand we both and aim we at the best : And for the time shall not seem tedious I'll tell thee what befell me on a day In this self-place where now we mean to stand <eos> Second Keeper : Here comes a man let's stay till he be past <eos> KING HENRY VI : From Scotland am I stol'n even of pure love To greet mine own land with my wishful sight <eos> No Harry Harry 'tis no land of thine Thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed : No bending knee will call thee Caesar now No humble suitors press to speak for right No not a man comes for redress of thee For how can I help them and not myself <eos> First Keeper : Ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee : This is the quondam king let's seize upon him <eos> KING HENRY VI : Let me embrace thee sour adversity For wise men say it is the wisest course <eos> Second Keeper : Why linger we <eos> let us lay hands upon him <eos> First Keeper : Forbear awhile we'll hear a little more <eos> KING HENRY VI : My queen and son are gone to France for aid And as I hear the great commanding Warwick Is thither gone to crave the French king's sister To wife for Edward : if this news be true Poor queen and son your labour is but lost For Warwick is a subtle orator And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words <eos> By this account then Margaret may win him For she's a woman to be pitied much : Her sighs will make a battery in his breast Her tears will pierce into a marble heart The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn And Nero will be tainted with remorse To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears <eos> Ay but she's come to beg Warwick to give She on his left side craving aid for Henry He on his right asking a wife for Edward <eos> She weeps and says her Henry is deposed He smiles and says his Edward is install'd That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong Inferreth arguments of mighty strength And in conclusion wins the king from her With promise of his sister and what else To strengthen and support King Edward's place <eos> O Margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul Art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn <eos> Second Keeper : Say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens <eos> KING HENRY VI : More than I seem and less than I was born to : A man at least for less I should not be And men may talk of kings and why not I <eos> Second Keeper : Ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king <eos> KING HENRY VI : Why so I am in mind and that's enough <eos> Second Keeper : But if thou be a king where is thy crown <eos> KING HENRY VI : My crown is in my heart not on my head Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones Nor to be seen : my crown is called content : A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy <eos> Second Keeper : Well if you be a king crown'd with content Your crown content and you must be contented To go along with us for as we think You are the king King Edward hath deposed And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance Will apprehend you as his enemy <eos> KING HENRY VI : But did you never swear and break an oath <eos> Second Keeper : No never such an oath nor will not now <eos> KING HENRY VI : Where did you dwell when I was King of England <eos> Second Keeper : Here in this country where we now remain <eos> KING HENRY VI : I was anointed king at nine months old My father and my grandfather were kings And you were sworn true subjects unto me : And tell me then have you not broke your oaths <eos> First Keeper : No For we were subjects but while you were king <eos> KING HENRY VI : Why am I dead <eos> do I not breathe a man <eos> Ah simple men you know not what you swear <eos> Look as I blow this feather from my face And as the air blows it to me again Obeying with my wind when I do blow And yielding to another when it blows Commanded always by the greater gust Such is the lightness of you common men <eos> But do not break your oaths for of that sin My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty <eos> Go where you will the king shall be commanded And be you kings command and I'll obey <eos> First Keeper : We are true subjects to the king King Edward <eos> KING HENRY VI : So would you be again to Henry If he were seated as King Edward is <eos> First Keeper : We charge you in God's name and the king's To go with us unto the officers <eos> KING HENRY VI : In God's name lead your king's name be obey'd : And what God will that let your king perform And what he will I humbly yield unto <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING EDWARD IV : Brother of Gloucester at Saint Alban's field This lady's husband Sir Richard Grey was slain His lands then seized on by the conqueror : Her suit is now to repossess those lands Which we in justice cannot well deny Because in quarrel of the house of York The worthy gentleman did lose his life <eos> GLOUCESTER : Your highness shall do well to grant her suit It were dishonour to deny it her <eos> KING EDWARD IV : It were no less but yet I'll make a pause <eos> GLOUCESTER : CLARENCE : GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : Widow we will consider of your suit And come some other time to know our mind <eos> LADY GREY : Right gracious lord I cannot brook delay : May it please your highness to resolve me now And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me <eos> GLOUCESTER : CLARENCE : GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : How many children hast thou widow <eos> tell me <eos> CLARENCE : GLOUCESTER : LADY GREY : Three my most gracious lord <eos> GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands <eos> LADY GREY : Be pitiful dread lord and grant it then <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Lords give us leave : I'll try this widow's wit <eos> GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : Now tell me madam do you love your children <eos> LADY GREY : Ay full as dearly as I love myself <eos> KING EDWARD IV : And would you not do much to do them good <eos> LADY GREY : To do them good I would sustain some harm <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Then get your husband's lands to do them good <eos> LADY GREY : Therefore I came unto your majesty <eos> KING EDWARD IV : I'll tell you how these lands are to be got <eos> LADY GREY : So shall you bind me to your highness' service <eos> KING EDWARD IV : What service wilt thou do me if I give them <eos> LADY GREY : What you command that rests in me to do <eos> KING EDWARD IV : But you will take exceptions to my boon <eos> LADY GREY : No gracious lord except I cannot do it <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask <eos> LADY GREY : Why then I will do what your grace commands <eos> GLOUCESTER : CLARENCE : LADY GREY : Why stops my lord shall I not hear my task <eos> KING EDWARD IV : An easy task 'tis but to love a king <eos> LADY GREY : That's soon perform'd because I am a subject <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Why then thy husband's lands I freely give thee <eos> LADY GREY : I take my leave with many thousand thanks <eos> GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : But stay thee 'tis the fruits of love I mean <eos> LADY GREY : The fruits of love I mean my loving liege <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Ay but I fear me in another sense <eos> What love think'st thou I sue so much to get <eos> LADY GREY : My love till death my humble thanks my prayers That love which virtue begs and virtue grants <eos> KING EDWARD IV : No by my troth I did not mean such love <eos> LADY GREY : Why then you mean not as I thought you did <eos> KING EDWARD IV : But now you partly may perceive my mind <eos> LADY GREY : My mind will never grant what I perceive Your highness aims at if I aim aright <eos> KING EDWARD IV : To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee <eos> LADY GREY : To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands <eos> LADY GREY : Why then mine honesty shall be my dower For by that loss I will not purchase them <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily <eos> LADY GREY : Herein your highness wrongs both them and me <eos> But mighty lord this merry inclination Accords not with the sadness of my suit : Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no <eos>' KING EDWARD IV : Ay if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand <eos> LADY GREY : Then no my lord <eos> My suit is at an end <eos> GLOUCESTER : CLARENCE : KING EDWARD IV : LADY GREY : 'Tis better said than done my gracious lord : I am a subject fit to jest withal But far unfit to be a sovereign <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee I speak no more than what my soul intends And that is to enjoy thee for my love <eos> LADY GREY : And that is more than I will yield unto : I know I am too mean to be your queen And yet too good to be your concubine <eos> KING EDWARD IV : You cavil widow : I did mean my queen <eos> LADY GREY : 'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father <eos> KING EDWARD IV : No more than when my daughters call thee mother <eos> Thou art a widow and thou hast some children And by God's mother I being but a bachelor Have other some : why 'tis a happy thing To be the father unto many sons <eos> Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen <eos> GLOUCESTER : CLARENCE : KING EDWARD IV : Brothers you muse what chat we two have had <eos> GLOUCESTER : The widow likes it not for she looks very sad <eos> KING EDWARD IV : You'll think it strange if I should marry her <eos> CLARENCE : To whom my lord <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Why Clarence to myself <eos> GLOUCESTER : That would be ten days' wonder at the least <eos> CLARENCE : That's a day longer than a wonder lasts <eos> GLOUCESTER : By so much is the wonder in extremes <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Well jest on brothers : I can tell you both Her suit is granted for her husband's lands <eos> Nobleman : My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken And brought your prisoner to your palace gate <eos> KING EDWARD IV : See that he be convey'd unto the Tower : And go we brothers to the man that took him To question of his apprehension <eos> Widow go you along <eos> Lords use her honourably <eos> GLOUCESTER : Ay Edward will use women honourably <eos> Would he were wasted marrow bones and all That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring To cross me from the golden time I look for <eos> And yet between my soul's desire and me <eos> The lustful Edward's title buried <eos> Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies To take their rooms ere I can place myself : A cold premeditation for my purpose <eos> Why then I do but dream on sovereignty Like one that stands upon a promontory And spies a far-off shore where he would tread Wishing his foot were equal with his eye And chides the sea that sunders him from thence Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way : So do I wish the crown being so far off And so I chide the means that keeps me from it And so I say I'll cut the causes off Flattering me with impossibilities <eos> My eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much Unless my hand and strength could equal them <eos> Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard What other pleasure can the world afford <eos> I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap And deck my body in gay ornaments And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks <eos> O miserable thought <eos> and more unlikely Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns <eos> Why love forswore me in my mother's womb : And for I should not deal in her soft laws She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub To make an envious mountain on my back Where sits deformity to mock my body To shape my legs of an unequal size To disproportion me in every part Like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear-whelp That carries no impression like the dam <eos> And am I then a man to be beloved <eos> O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought <eos> Then since this earth affords no joy to me But to command to cheque to o'erbear such As are of better person than myself I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown And whiles I live to account this world but hell Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head Be round impaled with a glorious crown <eos> And yet I know not how to get the crown For many lives stand between me and home : And I <eos>like one lost in a thorny wood That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns Seeking a way and straying from the way Not knowing how to find the open air But toiling desperately to find it out <eos> Torment myself to catch the English crown : And from that torment I will free myself Or hew my way out with a bloody axe <eos> Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart And wet my cheeks with artificial tears And frame my face to all occasions <eos> I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk I'll play the orator as well as Nestor Deceive more slily than Ulysses could And like a Sinon take another Troy <eos> I can add colours to the chameleon Change shapes with Proteus for advantages And set the murderous Machiavel to school <eos> Can I do this and cannot get a crown <eos> Tut were it farther off I'll pluck it down <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING LEWIS XI : Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret Sit down with us : it ill befits thy state And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : No mighty King of France : now Margaret Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve Where kings command <eos> I was I must confess Great Albion's queen in former golden days : But now mischance hath trod my title down And with dishonour laid me on the ground Where I must take like seat unto my fortune And to my humble seat conform myself <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears And stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Whate'er it be be thou still like thyself And sit thee by our side : Yield not thy neck To fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance <eos> Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief It shall be eased if France can yield relief <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak <eos> Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry sole possessor of my love Is of a king become a banish'd man And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of England's true-anointed lawful king <eos> This is the cause that I poor Margaret With this my son Prince Edward Henry's heir Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid And if thou fail us all our hope is done : Scotland hath will to help but cannot help Our people and our peers are both misled Our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Renowned queen with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it off <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : The more we stay the stronger grows our foe <eos> KING LEWIS XI : The more I stay the more I'll succor thee <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow <eos> And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow <eos> KING LEWIS XI : What's he approacheth boldly to our presence <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Our Earl of Warwick Edward's greatest friend <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Welcome brave Warwick <eos> What brings thee to France <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Ay now begins a second storm to rise For this is he that moves both wind and tide <eos> WARWICK : From worthy Edward King of Albion My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend I come in kindness and unfeigned love First to do greetings to thy royal person And then to crave a league of amity And lastly to confirm that amity With a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister To England's king in lawful marriage <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : WARWICK : QUEEN MARGARET : King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak Before you answer Warwick <eos> His demand Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love But from deceit bred by necessity For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance <eos> To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice That Henry liveth still : but were he dead Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henry's son <eos> Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour For though usurpers sway the rule awhile Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs <eos> WARWICK : Injurious Margaret <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : And why not queen <eos> WARWICK : Because thy father Henry did usurp And thou no more are prince than she is queen <eos> OXFORD : Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth Who by his prowess conquered all France : From these our Henry lineally descends <eos> WARWICK : Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry Fifth had gotten <eos> Methinks these peers of France should smile at that <eos> But for the rest you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years a silly time To make prescription for a kingdom's worth <eos> OXFORD : Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years And not bewray thy treason with a blush <eos> WARWICK : Can Oxford that did ever fence the right Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree <eos> For shame <eos> leave Henry and call Edward king <eos> OXFORD : Call him my king by whose injurious doom My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere Was done to death <eos> and more than so my father Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years When nature brought him to the door of death <eos> No Warwick no while life upholds this arm This arm upholds the house of Lancaster <eos> WARWICK : And I the house of York <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside While I use further conference with Warwick <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience Is Edward your true king <eos> for I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosen <eos> WARWICK : Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour <eos> KING LEWIS XI : But is he gracious in the people's eye <eos> WARWICK : The more that Henry was unfortunate <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Then further all dissembling set aside Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona <eos> WARWICK : Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself <eos> Myself have often heard him say and swear That this his love was an eternal plant Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun Exempt from envy but not from disdain Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Now sister let us hear your firm resolve <eos> BONA : Your grant or your denial shall be mine : Yet I confess that often ere this day When I have heard your king's desert recounted Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Then Warwick thus : our sister shall be Edward's And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised <eos> Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : To Edward but not to the English king <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Deceitful Warwick <eos> it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit : Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend <eos> KING LEWIS XI : And still is friend to him and Margaret : But if your title to the crown be weak As may appear by Edward's good success Then 'tis but reason that I be released From giving aid which late I promised <eos> Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield <eos> WARWICK : Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease Where having nothing nothing can he lose <eos> And as for you yourself our quondam queen You have a father able to maintain you And better 'twere you troubled him than France <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Peace impudent and shameless Warwick peace Proud setter up and puller down of kings <eos> I will not hence till with my talk and tears Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love For both of you are birds of selfsame feather <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Warwick this is some post to us or thee <eos> Post : OXFORD : I like it well that our fair queen and mistress Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled : I hope all's for the best <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Warwick what are thy news <eos> and yours fair queen <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys <eos> WARWICK : Mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent <eos> KING LEWIS XI : What <eos> has your king married the Lady Grey <eos> And now to soothe your forgery and his Sends me a paper to persuade me patience <eos> Is this the alliance that he seeks with France <eos> Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : I told your majesty as much before : This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty <eos> WARWICK : King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's No more my king for he dishonours me But most himself if he could see his shame <eos> Did I forget that by the house of York My father came untimely to his death <eos> Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece <eos> Did I impale him with the regal crown <eos> Did I put Henry from his native right <eos> And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame <eos> Shame on himself <eos> for my desert is honour : And to repair my honour lost for him I here renounce him and return to Henry <eos> My noble queen let former grudges pass And henceforth I am thy true servitor : I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona And replant Henry in his former state <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love And I forgive and quite forget old faults And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend <eos> WARWICK : So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers I'll undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war <eos> 'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him : And as for Clarence as my letters tell me He's very likely now to fall from him For matching more for wanton lust than honour Or than for strength and safety of our country <eos> BONA : Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged But by thy help to this distressed queen <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live Unless thou rescue him from foul despair <eos> BONA : My quarrel and this English queen's are one <eos> WARWICK : And mine fair lady Bona joins with yours <eos> KING LEWIS XI : And mine with hers and thine and Margaret's <eos> Therefore at last I firmly am resolved You shall have aid <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Let me give humble thanks for all at once <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Then England's messenger return in post And tell false Edward thy supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride : Thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal <eos> BONA : Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly I'll wear the willow garland for his sake <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside And I am ready to put armour on <eos> WARWICK : Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long <eos> There's thy reward : be gone <eos> KING LEWIS XI : But Warwick Thou and Oxford with five thousand men Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle And as occasion serves this noble queen And prince shall follow with a fresh supply <eos> Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty <eos> WARWICK : This shall assure my constant loyalty That if our queen and this young prince agree I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Yes I agree and thank you for your motion <eos> Son Edward she is fair and virtuous Therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Yes I accept her for she well deserves it And here to pledge my vow I give my hand <eos> KING LEWIS XI : Why stay we now <eos> These soldiers shall be levied And thou Lord Bourbon our high admiral Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet <eos> I long till Edward fall by war's mischance For mocking marriage with a dame of France <eos> WARWICK : I came from Edward as ambassador But I return his sworn and mortal foe : Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me But dreadful war shall answer his demand <eos> Had he none else to make a stale but me <eos> Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow <eos> I was the chief that raised him to the crown And I'll be chief to bring him down again : Not that I pity Henry's misery But seek revenge on Edward's mockery <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER : Now tell me brother Clarence what think you Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey <eos> Hath not our brother made a worthy choice <eos> CLARENCE : Alas you know 'tis far from hence to France How could he stay till Warwick made return <eos> SOMERSET : My lords forbear this talk here comes the king <eos> GLOUCESTER : And his well-chosen bride <eos> CLARENCE : I mind to tell him plainly what I think <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice That you stand pensive as half malcontent <eos> CLARENCE : As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That they'll take no offence at our abuse <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Suppose they take offence without a cause They are but Lewis and Warwick : I am Edward Your king and Warwick's and must have my will <eos> GLOUCESTER : And shall have your will because our king : Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Yea brother Richard are you offended too <eos> GLOUCESTER : Not I : No God forbid that I should wish them sever'd Whom God hath join'd together ay and 'twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well together <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Setting your scorns and your mislike aside Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and England's queen <eos> And you too Somerset and Montague Speak freely what you think <eos> CLARENCE : Then this is mine opinion : that King Lewis Becomes your enemy for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady Bona <eos> GLOUCESTER : And Warwick doing what you gave in charge Is now dishonoured by this new marriage <eos> KING EDWARD IV : What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased By such invention as I can devise <eos> MONTAGUE : Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth 'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage <eos> HASTINGS : Why knows not Montague that of itself England is safe if true within itself <eos> MONTAGUE : But the safer when 'tis back'd with France <eos> HASTINGS : 'Tis better using France than trusting France : Let us be back'd with God and with the seas Which He hath given for fence impregnable And with their helps only defend ourselves In them and in ourselves our safety lies <eos> CLARENCE : For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Ay what of that <eos> it was my will and grant And for this once my will shall stand for law <eos> GLOUCESTER : And yet methinks your grace hath not done well To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride She better would have fitted me or Clarence : But in your bride you bury brotherhood <eos> CLARENCE : Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Alas poor Clarence <eos> is it for a wife That thou art malcontent <eos> I will provide thee <eos> CLARENCE : In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment Which being shallow you give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf And to that end I shortly mind to leave you <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Leave me or tarry Edward will be king And not be tied unto his brother's will <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : My lords before it pleased his majesty To raise my state to title of a queen Do me but right and you must all confess That I was not ignoble of descent And meaner than myself have had like fortune <eos> But as this title honours me and mine So your dislike to whom I would be pleasing Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow <eos> KING EDWARD IV : My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns : What danger or what sorrow can befall thee So long as Edward is thy constant friend And their true sovereign whom they must obey <eos> Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too Unless they seek for hatred at my hands Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath <eos> GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : Now messenger what letters or what news From France <eos> Post : My sovereign liege no letters and few words But such as I without your special pardon Dare not relate <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Go to we pardon thee : therefore in brief Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them <eos> What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters <eos> Post : At my depart these were his very words : 'Go tell false Edward thy supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride <eos>' KING EDWARD IV : Is Lewis so brave <eos> belike he thinks me Henry <eos> But what said Lady Bona to my marriage <eos> Post : These were her words utter'd with mad disdain : 'Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly I'll wear the willow garland for his sake <eos>' KING EDWARD IV : I blame not her she could say little less She had the wrong <eos> But what said Henry's queen <eos> For I have heard that she was there in place <eos> Post : 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done And I am ready to put armour on <eos>' KING EDWARD IV : Belike she minds to play the Amazon <eos> But what said Warwick to these injuries <eos> Post : He more incensed against your majesty Than all the rest discharged me with these words : 'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long <eos>' KING EDWARD IV : Ha <eos> durst the traitor breathe out so proud words <eos> Well I will arm me being thus forewarn'd : They shall have wars and pay for their presumption <eos> But say is Warwick friends with Margaret <eos> Post : Ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter <eos> CLARENCE : Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger <eos> Now brother king farewell and sit you fast For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage I may not prove inferior to yourself <eos> You that love me and Warwick follow me <eos> GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick <eos> Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen And haste is needful in this desperate case <eos> Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf Go levy men and make prepare for war They are already or quickly will be landed : Myself in person will straight follow you <eos> But ere I go Hastings and Montague Resolve my doubt <eos> You twain of all the rest Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance : Tell me if you love Warwick more than me <eos> If it be so then both depart to him I rather wish you foes than hollow friends : But if you mind to hold your true obedience Give me assurance with some friendly vow That I may never have you in suspect <eos> MONTAGUE : So God help Montague as he proves true <eos> HASTINGS : And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Now brother Richard will you stand by us <eos> GLOUCESTER : Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Why so <eos> then am I sure of victory <eos> Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI WARWICK : Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well The common people by numbers swarm to us <eos> But see where Somerset and Clarence come <eos> Speak suddenly my lords are we all friends <eos> CLARENCE : Fear not that my lord <eos> WARWICK : Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick And welcome Somerset : I hold it cowardice To rest mistrustful where a noble heart Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love Else might I think that Clarence Edward's brother Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings : But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine <eos> And now what rests but in night's coverture Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd His soldiers lurking in the towns about And but attended by a simple guard We may surprise and take him at our pleasure <eos> Our scouts have found the adventure very easy : That as Ulysses and stout Diomede With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds So we well cover'd with the night's black mantle At unawares may beat down Edward's guard And seize himself I say not slaughter him For I intend but only to surprise him <eos> You that will follow me to this attempt Applaud the name of Henry with your leader <eos> Why then let's on our way in silent sort : For Warwick and his friends God and Saint George <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI First Watchman : Come on my masters each man take his stand : The king by this is set him down to sleep <eos> Second Watchman : What will he not to bed <eos> First Watchman : Why no for he hath made a solemn vow Never to lie and take his natural rest Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd <eos> Second Watchman : To-morrow then belike shall be the day If Warwick be so near as men report <eos> Third Watchman : But say I pray what nobleman is that That with the king here resteth in his tent <eos> First Watchman : 'Tis the Lord Hastings the king's chiefest friend <eos> Third Watchman : O is it so <eos> But why commands the king That his chief followers lodge in towns about him While he himself keeps in the cold field <eos> Second Watchman : 'Tis the more honour because more dangerous <eos> Third Watchman : Ay but give me worship and quietness I like it better than a dangerous honour <eos> If Warwick knew in what estate he stands 'Tis to be doubted he would waken him <eos> First Watchman : Unless our halberds did shut up his passage <eos> Second Watchman : Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent But to defend his person from night-foes <eos> WARWICK : This is his tent and see where stand his guard <eos> Courage my masters <eos> honour now or never <eos> But follow me and Edward shall be ours <eos> First Watchman : Who goes there <eos> Second Watchman : Stay or thou diest <eos> SOMERSET : What are they that fly there <eos> WARWICK : Richard and Hastings : let them go here is The duke <eos> KING EDWARD IV : The duke <eos> Why Warwick when we parted Thou call'dst me king <eos> WARWICK : Ay but the case is alter'd : When you disgraced me in my embassade Then I degraded you from being king And come now to create you Duke of York <eos> Alas <eos> how should you govern any kingdom That know not how to use ambassadors Nor how to be contented with one wife Nor how to use your brothers brotherly Nor how to study for the people's welfare Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Yea brother of Clarence are thou here too <eos> Nay then I see that Edward needs must down <eos> Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance Of thee thyself and all thy complices Edward will always bear himself as king : Though fortune's malice overthrow my state My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel <eos> WARWICK : Then for his mind be Edward England's king : But Henry now shall wear the English crown And be true king indeed thou but the shadow <eos> My Lord of Somerset at my request See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd Unto my brother Archbishop of York <eos> When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows I'll follow you and tell what answer Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him <eos> Now for a while farewell good Duke of York <eos> KING EDWARD IV : What fates impose that men must needs abide It boots not to resist both wind and tide <eos> OXFORD : What now remains my lords for us to do But march to London with our soldiers <eos> WARWICK : Ay that's the first thing that we have to do To free King Henry from imprisonment And see him seated in the regal throne <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI RIVERS : Madam what makes you in this sudden change <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Why brother Rivers are you yet to learn What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward <eos> RIVERS : What <eos> loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : No but the loss of his own royal person <eos> RIVERS : Then is my sovereign slain <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard Or by his foe surprised at unawares : And as I further have to understand Is new committed to the Bishop of York Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe <eos> RIVERS : These news I must confess are full of grief Yet gracious madam bear it as you may : Warwick may lose that now hath won the day <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay <eos> And I the rather wean me from despair For love of Edward's offspring in my womb : This is it that makes me bridle passion And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown King Edward's fruit true heir to the English crown <eos> RIVERS : But madam where is Warwick then become <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : I am inform'd that he comes towards London To set the crown once more on Henry's head : Guess thou the rest King Edward's friends must down But to prevent the tyrant's violence <eos> For trust not him that hath once broken faith <eos> I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary To save at least the heir of Edward's right : There shall I rest secure from force and fraud <eos> Come therefore let us fly while we may fly : If Warwick take us we are sure to die <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER : Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither Into this chiefest thicket of the park <eos> Thus stands the case : you know our king my brother Is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands He hath good usage and great liberty And often but attended with weak guard Comes hunting this way to disport himself <eos> I have advertised him by secret means That if about this hour he make his way Under the colour of his usual game He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity <eos> Huntsman : This way my lord for this way lies the game <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Nay this way man : see where the huntsmen stand <eos> Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest Stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer <eos> GLOUCESTER : Brother the time and case requireth haste : Your horse stands ready at the park-corner <eos> KING EDWARD IV : But whither shall we then <eos> HASTINGS : To Lynn my lord And ship from thence to Flanders <eos> GLOUCESTER : Well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Stanley I will requite thy forwardness <eos> GLOUCESTER : But wherefore stay we <eos> 'tis no time to talk <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Huntsman what say'st thou <eos> wilt thou go along <eos> Huntsman : Better do so than tarry and be hang'd <eos> GLOUCESTER : Come then away let's ha' no more ado <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Bishop farewell : shield thee from Warwick's frown And pray that I may repossess the crown <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING HENRY VI : Master lieutenant now that God and friends Have shaken Edward from the regal seat And turn'd my captive state to liberty My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys At our enlargement what are thy due fees <eos> Lieutenant : Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns But if an humble prayer may prevail I then crave pardon of your majesty <eos> KING HENRY VI : For what lieutenant <eos> for well using me <eos> Nay be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds Conceive when after many moody thoughts At last by notes of household harmony They quite forget their loss of liberty <eos> But Warwick after God thou set'st me free And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee He was the author thou the instrument <eos> Therefore that I may conquer fortune's spite By living low where fortune cannot hurt me And that the people of this blessed land May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars Warwick although my head still wear the crown I here resign my government to thee For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds <eos> WARWICK : Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous And now may seem as wise as virtuous By spying and avoiding fortune's malice For few men rightly temper with the stars : Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace For choosing me when Clarence is in place <eos> CLARENCE : No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway To whom the heavens in thy nativity Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown As likely to be blest in peace and war And therefore I yield thee my free consent <eos> WARWICK : And I choose Clarence only for protector <eos> KING HENRY VI : Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands : Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts That no dissension hinder government : I make you both protectors of this land While I myself will lead a private life And in devotion spend my latter days To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise <eos> WARWICK : What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will <eos> CLARENCE : That he consents if Warwick yield consent For on thy fortune I repose myself <eos> WARWICK : Why then though loath yet must I be content : We'll yoke together like a double shadow To Henry's body and supply his place I mean in bearing weight of government While he enjoys the honour and his ease <eos> And Clarence now then it is more than needful Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor And all his lands and goods be confiscate <eos> CLARENCE : What else <eos> and that succession be determined <eos> WARWICK : Ay therein Clarence shall not want his part <eos> KING HENRY VI : But with the first of all your chief affairs Let me entreat for I command no more That Margaret your queen and my son Edward Be sent for to return from France with speed For till I see them here by doubtful fear My joy of liberty is half eclipsed <eos> CLARENCE : It shall be done my sovereign with all speed <eos> KING HENRY VI : My Lord of Somerset what youth is that Of whom you seem to have so tender care <eos> SOMERSET : My liege it is young Henry earl of Richmond <eos> KING HENRY VI : Come hither England's hope <eos> If secret powers Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss <eos> His looks are full of peaceful majesty His head by nature framed to wear a crown His hand to wield a sceptre and himself Likely in time to bless a regal throne <eos> Make much of him my lords for this is he Must help you more than you are hurt by me <eos> WARWICK : What news my friend <eos> Post : That Edward is escaped from your brother And fled as he hears since to Burgundy <eos> WARWICK : Unsavoury news <eos> but how made he escape <eos> Post : He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester And the Lord Hastings who attended him In secret ambush on the forest side And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him For hunting was his daily exercise <eos> WARWICK : My brother was too careless of his charge <eos> But let us hence my sovereign to provide A salve for any sore that may betide <eos> SOMERSET : My lord I like not of this flight of Edward's For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help And we shall have more wars before 't be long <eos> As Henry's late presaging prophecy Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts What may befall him to his harm and ours : Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany Till storms be past of civil enmity <eos> OXFORD : Ay for if Edward repossess the crown 'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down <eos> SOMERSET : It shall be so he shall to Brittany <eos> Come therefore let's about it speedily <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING EDWARD IV : Now brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends And says that once more I shall interchange My waned state for Henry's regal crown <eos> Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas And brought desired help from Burgundy : What then remains we being thus arrived From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York But that we enter as into our dukedom <eos> GLOUCESTER : The gates made fast <eos> Brother I like not this For many men that stumble at the threshold Are well foretold that danger lurks within <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Tush man abodements must not now affright us : By fair or foul means we must enter in For hither will our friends repair to us <eos> HASTINGS : My liege I'll knock once more to summon them <eos> Mayor : My lords we were forewarned of your coming And shut the gates for safety of ourselves For now we owe allegiance unto Henry <eos> KING EDWARD IV : But master mayor if Henry be your king Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York <eos> Mayor : True my good lord I know you for no less <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom As being well content with that alone <eos> GLOUCESTER : HASTINGS : Why master mayor why stand you in a doubt <eos> Open the gates we are King Henry's friends <eos> Mayor : Ay say you so <eos> the gates shall then be open'd <eos> GLOUCESTER : A wise stout captain and soon persuaded <eos> HASTINGS : The good old man would fain that all were well So 'twere not 'long of him but being enter'd I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade Both him and all his brothers unto reason <eos> KING EDWARD IV : So master mayor : these gates must not be shut But in the night or in the time of war <eos> What <eos> fear not man but yield me up the keys For Edward will defend the town and thee And all those friends that deign to follow me <eos> GLOUCESTER : Brother this is Sir John Montgomery Our trusty friend unless I be deceived <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Welcome Sir John <eos> But why come you in arms <eos> MONTAGUE : To help King Edward in his time of storm As every loyal subject ought to do <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Thanks good Montgomery but we now forget Our title to the crown and only claim Our dukedom till God please to send the rest <eos> MONTAGUE : Then fare you well for I will hence again : I came to serve a king and not a duke <eos> Drummer strike up and let us march away <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Nay stay Sir John awhile and we'll debate By what safe means the crown may be recover'd <eos> MONTAGUE : What talk you of debating <eos> in few words If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone To keep them back that come to succor you : Why shall we fight if you pretend no title <eos> GLOUCESTER : Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points <eos> KING EDWARD IV : When we grow stronger then we'll make our claim : Till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning <eos> HASTINGS : Away with scrupulous wit <eos> now arms must rule <eos> GLOUCESTER : And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns <eos> Brother we will proclaim you out of hand : The bruit thereof will bring you many friends <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Then be it as you will for 'tis my right And Henry but usurps the diadem <eos> MONTAGUE : Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself And now will I be Edward's champion <eos> HASTINGS : Sound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaim'd : Come fellow-soldier make thou proclamation <eos> Soldier : Edward the Fourth by the grace of God king of England and France and lord of Ireland &c <eos> MONTAGUE : And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right By this I challenge him to single fight <eos> All : Long live Edward the Fourth <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Thanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all : If fortune serve me I'll requite this kindness <eos> Now for this night let's harbour here in York And when the morning sun shall raise his car Above the border of this horizon We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates For well I wot that Henry is no soldier <eos> Ah froward Clarence <eos> how evil it beseems thee To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother <eos> Yet as we may we'll meet both thee and Warwick <eos> Come on brave soldiers : doubt not of the day And that once gotten doubt not of large pay <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI WARWICK : What counsel lords <eos> Edward from Belgia With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas And with his troops doth march amain to London And many giddy people flock to him <eos> KING HENRY VI : Let's levy men and beat him back again <eos> CLARENCE : A little fire is quickly trodden out Which being suffer'd rivers cannot quench <eos> WARWICK : In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war Those will I muster up : and thou son Clarence Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent The knights and gentlemen to come with thee : Thou brother Montague in Buckingham Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st : And thou brave Oxford wondrous well beloved In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends <eos> My sovereign with the loving citizens Like to his island girt in with the ocean Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs Shall rest in London till we come to him <eos> Fair lords take leave and stand not to reply <eos> Farewell my sovereign <eos> KING HENRY VI : Farewell my Hector and my Troy's true hope <eos> CLARENCE : In sign of truth I kiss your highness' hand <eos> KING HENRY VI : Well-minded Clarence be thou fortunate <eos> MONTAGUE : Comfort my lord and so I take my leave <eos> OXFORD : And thus I seal my truth and bid adieu <eos> KING HENRY VI : Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague And all at once once more a happy farewell <eos> WARWICK : Farewell sweet lords : let's meet at Coventry <eos> KING HENRY VI : Here at the palace I will rest awhile <eos> Cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship <eos> Methinks the power that Edward hath in field Should not be able to encounter mine <eos> EXETER : The doubt is that he will seduce the rest <eos> KING HENRY VI : That's not my fear my meed hath got me fame : I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands Nor posted off their suits with slow delays My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs My mercy dried their water-flowing tears I have not been desirous of their wealth Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies <eos> Nor forward of revenge though they much err'd : Then why should they love Edward more than me <eos> No Exeter these graces challenge grace : And when the lion fawns upon the lamb The lamb will never cease to follow him <eos> EXETER : Hark hark my lord <eos> what shouts are these <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Seize on the shame-faced Henry bear him hence And once again proclaim us King of England <eos> You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow : Now stops thy spring my sea sha$l suck them dry And swell so much the higher by their ebb <eos> Hence with him to the Tower let him not speak <eos> And lords towards Coventry bend we our course Where peremptory Warwick now remains : The sun shines hot and if we use delay Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay <eos> GLOUCESTER : Away betimes before his forces join And take the great-grown traitor unawares : Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI WARWICK : Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford <eos> How far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow <eos> First Messenger : By this at Dunsmore marching hitherward <eos> WARWICK : How far off is our brother Montague <eos> Where is the post that came from Montague <eos> Second Messenger : By this at Daintry with a puissant troop <eos> WARWICK : Say Somerville what says my loving son <eos> And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now <eos> SOMERSET : At Southam I did leave him with his forces And do expect him here some two hours hence <eos> WARWICK : Then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum <eos> SOMERSET : It is not his my lord here Southam lies : The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick <eos> WARWICK : Who should that be <eos> belike unlook'd-for friends <eos> SOMERSET : They are at hand and you shall quickly know <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle <eos> GLOUCESTER : See how the surly Warwick mans the wall <eos> WARWICK : O unbid spite <eos> is sportful Edward come <eos> Where slept our scouts or how are they seduced That we could hear no news of his repair <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy <eos> And he shall pardon thee these outrages <eos> WARWICK : Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own Call Warwick patron and be penitent <eos> And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York <eos> GLOUCESTER : I thought at least he would have said the king Or did he make the jest against his will <eos> WARWICK : Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift <eos> GLOUCESTER : Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give : I'll do thee service for so good a gift <eos> WARWICK : 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Why then 'tis mine if but by Warwick's gift <eos> WARWICK : Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight : And weakling Warwick takes his gift again And Henry is my king Warwick his subject <eos> KING EDWARD IV : But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner : And gallant Warwick do but answer this : What is the body when the head is off <eos> GLOUCESTER : Alas that Warwick had no more forecast But whiles he thought to steal the single ten The king was slily finger'd from the deck <eos> You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower <eos> EDWARD : 'Tis even so yet you are Warwick still <eos> GLOUCESTER : Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down : Nay when <eos> strike now or else the iron cools <eos> WARWICK : I had rather chop this hand off at a blow And with the other fling it at thy face Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend This hand fast wound about thy coal-black hair Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood 'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more <eos>' WARWICK : O cheerful colours <eos> see where Oxford comes <eos> OXFORD : Oxford Oxford for Lancaster <eos> GLOUCESTER : The gates are open let us enter too <eos> KING EDWARD IV : So other foes may set upon our backs <eos> Stand we in good array for they no doubt Will issue out again and bid us battle : If not the city being but of small defence We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same <eos> WARWICK : O welcome Oxford <eos> for we want thy help <eos> MONTAGUE : Montague Montague for Lancaster <eos> GLOUCESTER : Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear <eos> KING EDWARD IV : The harder match'd the greater victory : My mind presageth happy gain and conquest <eos> SOMERSET : Somerset Somerset for Lancaster <eos> GLOUCESTER : Two of thy name both Dukes of Somerset Have sold their lives unto the house of York And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold <eos> WARWICK : And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along Of force enough to bid his brother battle With whom an upright zeal to right prevails More than the nature of a brother's love <eos> Come Clarence come thou wilt if Warwick call <eos> CLARENCE : Father of Warwick know you what this means <eos> Look here I throw my infamy at thee I will not ruinate my father's house Who gave his blood to lime the stones together And set up Lancaster <eos> Why trow'st thou Warwick That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural To bend the fatal instruments of war Against his brother and his lawful king <eos> Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath : To keep that oath were more impiety Than Jephthah's when he sacrificed his daughter <eos> I am so sorry for my trespass made That to deserve well at my brother's hands I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe With resolution wheresoe'er I meet thee <eos> As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad <eos> To plague thee for thy foul misleading me <eos> And so proud-hearted Warwick I defy thee And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks <eos> Pardon me Edward I will make amends : And Richard do not frown upon my faults For I will henceforth be no more unconstant <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Now welcome more and ten times more beloved Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate <eos> GLOUCESTER : Welcome good Clarence this is brotherlike <eos> WARWICK : O passing traitor perjured and unjust <eos> KING EDWARD IV : What Warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight <eos> Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears <eos> WARWICK : Alas I am not coop'd here for defence <eos> I will away towards Barnet presently And bid thee battle Edward if thou darest <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Yes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way <eos> Lords to the field Saint George and victory <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING EDWARD IV : So lie thou there : die thou and die our fear For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all <eos> Now Montague sit fast I seek for thee That Warwick's bones may keep thine company <eos> WARWICK : Ah who is nigh <eos> come to me friend or foe And tell me who is victor York or Warwick <eos> Why ask I that <eos> my mangled body shows My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows <eos> That I must yield my body to the earth And by my fall the conquest to my foe <eos> Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle Under whose shade the ramping lion slept Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind <eos> These eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun To search the secret treasons of the world : The wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres For who lived king but I could dig his grave <eos> And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow <eos> Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood <eos> My parks my walks my manors that I had <eos> Even now forsake me and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my body's length <eos> Why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust <eos> And live we how we can yet die we must <eos> SOMERSET : Ah Warwick Warwick <eos> wert thou as we are <eos> We might recover all our loss again The queen from France hath brought a puissant power : Even now we heard the news : ah could'st thou fly <eos> WARWICK : Why then I would not fly <eos> Ah Montague If thou be there sweet brother take my hand <eos> And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile <eos> Thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak <eos> Come quickly Montague or I am dead <eos> SOMERSET : Ah Warwick <eos> Montague hath breathed his last And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother <eos>' And more he would have said and more he spoke Which sounded like a clamour in a vault That mought not be distinguished but at last I well might hear delivered with a groan 'O farewell Warwick <eos>' WARWICK : Sweet rest his soul <eos> Fly lords and save yourselves For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven <eos> OXFORD : Away away to meet the queen's great power <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING EDWARD IV : Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course And we are graced with wreaths of victory <eos> But in the midst of this bright-shining day I spy a black suspicious threatening cloud That will encounter with our glorious sun Ere he attain his easeful western bed : I mean my lords those powers that the queen Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast And as we hear march on to fight with us <eos> CLARENCE : A little gale will soon disperse that cloud And blow it to the source from whence it came : The very beams will dry those vapours up For every cloud engenders not a storm <eos> GLOUCESTER : The queen is valued thirty thousand strong And Somerset with Oxford fled to her : If she have time to breathe be well assured Her faction will be full as strong as ours <eos> KING EDWARD IV : We are advertised by our loving friends That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury : We having now the best at Barnet field Will thither straight for willingness rids way And as we march our strength will be augmented In every county as we go along <eos> Strike up the drum cry 'Courage <eos>' and away <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET : Great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss But cheerly seek how to redress their harms <eos> What though the mast be now blown overboard The cable broke the holding-anchor lost And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood <eos> Yet lives our pilot still <eos> Is't meet that he Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad With tearful eyes add water to the sea And give more strength to that which hath too much Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock Which industry and courage might have saved <eos> Ah what a shame <eos> ah what a fault were this <eos> Say Warwick was our anchor what of that <eos> And Montague our topmost what of him <eos> Our slaughter'd friends the tackles what of these <eos> Why is not Oxford here another anchor <eos> And Somerset another goodly mast <eos> The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings <eos> And though unskilful why not Ned and I For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge <eos> We will not from the helm to sit and weep But keep our course though the rough wind say no From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck <eos> As good to chide the waves as speak them fair <eos> And what is Edward but ruthless sea <eos> What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit <eos> And Richard but a ragged fatal rock <eos> All these the enemies to our poor bark <eos> Say you can swim alas 'tis but a while <eos> Tread on the sand why there you quickly sink : Bestride the rock the tide will wash you off Or else you famish that's a threefold death <eos> This speak I lords to let you understand If case some one of you would fly from us That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks <eos> Why courage then <eos> what cannot be avoided 'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit Should if a coward heard her speak these words Infuse his breast with magnanimity And make him naked foil a man at arms <eos> I speak not this as doubting any here For did I but suspect a fearful man He should have leave to go away betimes Lest in our need he might infect another And make him of like spirit to himself <eos> If any such be here <eos>as God forbid <eos> <eos> Let him depart before we need his help <eos> OXFORD : Women and children of so high a courage And warriors faint <eos> why 'twere perpetual shame <eos> O brave young prince <eos> thy famous grandfather Doth live again in thee : long mayst thou live To bear his image and renew his glories <eos> SOMERSET : And he that will not fight for such a hope <eos> Go home to bed and like the owl by day If he arise be mock'd and wonder'd at <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Thanks gentle Somerset sweet Oxford thanks <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else <eos> Messenger : Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand <eos> Ready to fight therefore be resolute <eos> OXFORD : I thought no less : it is his policy To haste thus fast to find us unprovided <eos> SOMERSET : But he's deceived we are in readiness <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : This cheers my heart to see your forwardness <eos> OXFORD : Here pitch our battle hence we will not budge <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood Which by the heavens' assistance and your strength Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night <eos> I need not add more fuel to your fire For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out Give signal to the fight and to it lords <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Lords knights and gentlemen what I should say My tears gainsay for every word I speak Ye see I drink the water of mine eyes <eos> Therefore no more but this : Henry your sovereign Is prisoner to the foe his state usurp'd His realm a slaughter-house his subjects slain His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil <eos> You fight in justice : then in God's name lords Be valiant and give signal to the fight <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING EDWARD IV : Now here a period of tumultuous broils <eos> Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight : For Somerset off with his guilty head <eos> Go bear them hence I will not hear them speak <eos> OXFORD : For my part I'll not trouble thee with words <eos> SOMERSET : Nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : So part we sadly in this troublous world To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Is proclamation made that who finds Edward Shall have a high reward and he his life <eos> GLOUCESTER : It is : and lo where youthful Edward comes <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak <eos> What <eos> can so young a thorn begin to prick <eos> Edward what satisfaction canst thou make For bearing arms for stirring up my subjects And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Speak like a subject proud ambitious York <eos> Suppose that I am now my father's mouth Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee Which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Ah that thy father had been so resolved <eos> GLOUCESTER : That you might still have worn the petticoat And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Let AEsop fable in a winter's night His currish riddles sort not with this place <eos> GLOUCESTER : By heaven brat I'll plague ye for that word <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Ay thou wast born to be a plague to men <eos> GLOUCESTER : For God's sake take away this captive scold <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : Nay take away this scolding crookback rather <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Peace wilful boy or I will charm your tongue <eos> CLARENCE : Untutor'd lad thou art too malapert <eos> PRINCE EDWARD : I know my duty you are all undutiful : Lascivious Edward and thou perjured George And thou mis-shapen Dick I tell ye all I am your better traitors as ye are : And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Take that thou likeness of this railer here <eos> GLOUCESTER : Sprawl'st thou <eos> take that to end thy agony <eos> CLARENCE : And there's for twitting me with perjury <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : O kill me too <eos> GLOUCESTER : Marry and shall <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Hold Richard hold for we have done too much <eos> GLOUCESTER : Why should she live to fill the world with words <eos> KING EDWARD IV : What doth she swoon <eos> use means for her recovery <eos> GLOUCESTER : Clarence excuse me to the king my brother I'll hence to London on a serious matter : Ere ye come there be sure to hear some news <eos> CLARENCE : What <eos> what <eos> GLOUCESTER : The Tower the Tower <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : O Ned sweet Ned <eos> speak to thy mother boy <eos> Canst thou not speak <eos> O traitors <eos> murderers <eos> They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all Did not offend nor were not worthy blame If this foul deed were by to equal it : He was a man this in respect a child : And men ne'er spend their fury on a child <eos> What's worse than murderer that I may name it <eos> No no my heart will burst and if I speak : And I will speak that so my heart may burst <eos> Butchers and villains <eos> bloody cannibals <eos> How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd <eos> You have no children butchers <eos> if you had The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse : But if you ever chance to have a child Look in his youth to have him so cut off As deathmen you have rid this sweet young prince <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Away with her go bear her hence perforce <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Nay never bear me hence dispatch me here Here sheathe thy sword I'll pardon thee my death : What wilt thou not <eos> then Clarence do it thou <eos> CLARENCE : By heaven I will not do thee so much ease <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Good Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do it <eos> CLARENCE : Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : Ay but thou usest to forswear thyself : 'Twas sin before but now 'tis charity <eos> What wilt thou not <eos> Where is that devil's butcher Hard-favour'd Richard <eos> Richard where art thou <eos> Thou art not here : murder is thy alms-deed Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Away I say I charge ye bear her hence <eos> QUEEN MARGARET : So come to you and yours as to this Prince <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Where's Richard gone <eos> CLARENCE : To London all in post and as I guess To make a bloody supper in the Tower <eos> KING EDWARD IV : He's sudden if a thing comes in his head <eos> Now march we hence : discharge the common sort With pay and thanks and let's away to London And see our gentle queen how well she fares : By this I hope she hath a son for me <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER : Good day my lord <eos> What at your book so hard <eos> KING HENRY VI : Ay my good lord : <eos>my lord I should say rather 'Tis sin to flatter 'good' was little better : 'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike And both preposterous therefore not 'good lord <eos>' GLOUCESTER : Sirrah leave us to ourselves : we must confer <eos> KING HENRY VI : So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece And next his throat unto the butcher's knife <eos> What scene of death hath Roscius now to act <eos> GLOUCESTER : Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind The thief doth fear each bush an officer <eos> KING HENRY VI : The bird that hath been limed in a bush With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush And I the hapless male to one sweet bird Have now the fatal object in my eye Where my poor young was limed was caught and kill'd <eos> GLOUCESTER : Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete That taught his son the office of a fowl <eos> An yet for all his wings the fool was drown'd <eos> KING HENRY VI : I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus Thy father Minos that denied our course The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life <eos> Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words <eos> My breast can better brook thy dagger's point Than can my ears that tragic history <eos> But wherefore dost thou come <eos> is't for my life <eos> GLOUCESTER : Think'st thou I am an executioner <eos> KING HENRY VI : A persecutor I am sure thou art : If murdering innocents be executing Why then thou art an executioner <eos> GLOUCESTER : Thy son I kill'd for his presumption <eos> KING HENRY VI : Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine <eos> And thus I prophesy that many a thousand Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's And many an orphan's water-standing eye <eos> Men for their sons wives for their husbands And orphans for their parents timeless death <eos> Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born <eos> The owl shriek'd at thy birth <eos>an evil sign The night-crow cried aboding luckless time Dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top And chattering pies in dismal discords sung <eos> Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope To wit an indigested and deformed lump Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree <eos> Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born To signify thou camest to bite the world : And if the rest be true which I have heard Thou camest <eos> GLOUCESTER : I'll hear no more : die prophet in thy speech : For this amongst the rest was I ordain'd <eos> KING HENRY VI : Ay and for much more slaughter after this <eos> God forgive my sins and pardon thee <eos> GLOUCESTER : What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground <eos> I thought it would have mounted <eos> See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death <eos> O may such purple tears be alway shed From those that wish the downfall of our house <eos> If any spark of life be yet remaining Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither : I that have neither pity love nor fear <eos> Indeed 'tis true that Henry told me of For I have often heard my mother say I came into the world with my legs forward : Had I not reason think ye to make haste And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right <eos> The midwife wonder'd and the women cried 'O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth <eos>' And so I was which plainly signified That I should snarl and bite and play the dog <eos> Then since the heavens have shaped my body so Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it <eos> I have no brother I am like no brother And this word 'love' which graybeards call divine Be resident in men like one another And not in me : I am myself alone <eos> Clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light : But I will sort a pitchy day for thee For I will buz abroad such prophecies That Edward shall be fearful of his life And then to purge his fear I'll be thy death <eos> King Henry and the prince his son are gone : Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest Counting myself but bad till I be best <eos> I'll throw thy body in another room And triumph Henry in thy day of doom <eos> 3 KING HENRY VI KING EDWARD IV : Once more we sit in England's royal throne Re-purchased with the blood of enemies <eos> What valiant foemen like to autumn's corn Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride <eos> Three Dukes of Somerset threefold renown'd For hardy and undoubted champions Two Cliffords as the father and the son And two Northumberlands two braver men Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion And made the forest tremble when they roar'd <eos> Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat And made our footstool of security <eos> Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy <eos> Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain <eos> GLOUCESTER : KING EDWARD IV : Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen And kiss your princely nephew brothers both <eos> CLARENCE : The duty that I owe unto your majesty I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe <eos> QUEEN ELIZABETH : Thanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanks <eos> GLOUCESTER : And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Now am I seated as my soul delights Having my country's peace and brothers' loves <eos> CLARENCE : What will your grace have done with Margaret <eos> Reignier her father to the king of France Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem And hither have they sent it for her ransom <eos> KING EDWARD IV : Away with her and waft her hence to France <eos> And now what rests but that we spend the time With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows Such as befits the pleasure of the court <eos> Sound drums and trumpets <eos> farewell sour annoy <eos> For here I hope begins our lasting joy <eos> ARCHIDAMUS : If you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as I have said great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia <eos> CAMILLO : I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him <eos> ARCHIDAMUS : Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed <eos> CAMILLO : Beseech you <eos> ARCHIDAMUS : Verily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge : we cannot with such magnificence <eos>in so rare <eos>I know not what to say <eos> We will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot praise us as little accuse us <eos> CAMILLO : You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely <eos> ARCHIDAMUS : Believe me I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance <eos> CAMILLO : Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia <eos> They were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now <eos> Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds <eos> The heavens continue their loves <eos> ARCHIDAMUS : I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it <eos> You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius : it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note <eos> CAMILLO : I very well agree with you in the hopes of him : it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh : they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man <eos> ARCHIDAMUS : Would they else be content to die <eos> CAMILLO : Yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live <eos> ARCHIDAMUS : If the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one <eos> POLIXENES : Nine changes of the watery star hath been The shepherd's note since we have left our throne Without a burthen : time as long again Would be find up my brother with our thanks And yet we should for perpetuity Go hence in debt : and therefore like a cipher Yet standing in rich place I multiply With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe That go before it <eos> LEONTES : Stay your thanks a while And pay them when you part <eos> POLIXENES : Sir that's to-morrow <eos> I am question'd by my fears of what may chance Or breed upon our absence that may blow No sneaping winds at home to make us say 'This is put forth too truly :' besides I have stay'd To tire your royalty <eos> LEONTES : We are tougher brother Than you can put us to't <eos> POLIXENES : No longer stay <eos> LEONTES : One seven-night longer <eos> POLIXENES : Very sooth to-morrow <eos> LEONTES : We'll part the time between's then and in that I'll no gainsaying <eos> POLIXENES : Press me not beseech you so <eos> There is no tongue that moves none none i' the world So soon as yours could win me : so it should now Were there necessity in your request although 'Twere needful I denied it <eos> My affairs Do even drag me homeward : which to hinder Were in your love a whip to me my stay To you a charge and trouble : to save both Farewell our brother <eos> LEONTES : Tongue-tied our queen <eos> speak you <eos> HERMIONE : I had thought sir to have held my peace until You have drawn oaths from him not to stay <eos> You sir Charge him too coldly <eos> Tell him you are sure All in Bohemia's well this satisfaction The by-gone day proclaim'd : say this to him He's beat from his best ward <eos> LEONTES : Well said Hermione <eos> HERMIONE : To tell he longs to see his son were strong : But let him say so then and let him go But let him swear so and he shall not stay We'll thwack him hence with distaffs <eos> Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure The borrow of a week <eos> When at Bohemia You take my lord I'll give him my commission To let him there a month behind the gest Prefix'd for's parting : yet good deed Leontes I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind What lady-she her lord <eos> You'll stay <eos> POLIXENES : No madam <eos> HERMIONE : Nay but you will <eos> POLIXENES : I may not verily <eos> HERMIONE : Verily <eos> You put me off with limber vows but I Though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths Should yet say 'Sir no going <eos>' Verily You shall not go : a lady's 'Verily' 's As potent as a lord's <eos> Will you go yet <eos> Force me to keep you as a prisoner Not like a guest so you shall pay your fees When you depart and save your thanks <eos> How say you <eos> My prisoner <eos> or my guest <eos> by your dread 'Verily' One of them you shall be <eos> POLIXENES : Your guest then madam : To be your prisoner should import offending Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish <eos> HERMIONE : Not your gaoler then But your kind hostess <eos> Come I'll question you Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys : You were pretty lordings then <eos> POLIXENES : We were fair queen Two lads that thought there was no more behind But such a day to-morrow as to-day And to be boy eternal <eos> HERMIONE : Was not my lord The verier wag o' the two <eos> POLIXENES : We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun And bleat the one at the other : what we changed Was innocence for innocence we knew not The doctrine of ill-doing nor dream'd That any did <eos> Had we pursued that life And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd With stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven Boldly 'not guilty' the imposition clear'd Hereditary ours <eos> HERMIONE : By this we gather You have tripp'd since <eos> POLIXENES : O my most sacred lady <eos> Temptations have since then been born to's for In those unfledged days was my wife a girl Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes Of my young play-fellow <eos> HERMIONE : Grace to boot <eos> Of this make no conclusion lest you say Your queen and I are devils : yet go on The offences we have made you do we'll answer If you first sinn'd with us and that with us You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not With any but with us <eos> LEONTES : Is he won yet <eos> HERMIONE : He'll stay my lord <eos> LEONTES : At my request he would not <eos> Hermione my dearest thou never spokest To better purpose <eos> HERMIONE : Never <eos> LEONTES : Never but once <eos> HERMIONE : What <eos> have I twice said well <eos> when was't before <eos> I prithee tell me cram's with praise and make's As fat as tame things : one good deed dying tongueless Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that <eos> Our praises are our wages : you may ride's With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere With spur we beat an acre <eos> But to the goal : My last good deed was to entreat his stay : What was my first <eos> it has an elder sister Or I mistake you : O would her name were Grace <eos> But once before I spoke to the purpose : when <eos> Nay let me have't I long <eos> LEONTES : Why that was when Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death Ere I could make thee open thy white hand And clap thyself my love : then didst thou utter 'I am yours for ever <eos>' HERMIONE : 'Tis grace indeed <eos> Why lo you now I have spoke to the purpose twice : The one for ever earn'd a royal husband The other for some while a friend <eos> LEONTES : MAMILLIUS : Ay my good lord <eos> LEONTES : I' fecks <eos> Why that's my bawcock <eos> What hast smutch'd thy nose <eos> They say it is a copy out of mine <eos> Come captain We must be neat not neat but cleanly captain : And yet the steer the heifer and the calf Are all call'd neat <eos> <eos>Still virginalling Upon his palm <eos> <eos>How now you wanton calf <eos> Art thou my calf <eos> MAMILLIUS : Yes if you will my lord <eos> LEONTES : Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have To be full like me : yet they say we are Almost as like as eggs women say so That will say anything but were they false As o'er-dyed blacks as wind as waters false As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes No bourn 'twixt his and mine yet were it true To say this boy were like me <eos> Come sir page Look on me with your welkin eye : sweet villain <eos> Most dear'st <eos> my collop <eos> Can thy dam <eos> <eos>may't be <eos> <eos> Affection <eos> thy intention stabs the centre : Thou dost make possible things not so held Communicatest with dreams <eos>how can this be <eos> <eos> With what's unreal thou coactive art And fellow'st nothing : then 'tis very credent Thou mayst co-join with something and thou dost And that beyond commission and I find it And that to the infection of my brains And hardening of my brows <eos> POLIXENES : What means Sicilia <eos> HERMIONE : He something seems unsettled <eos> POLIXENES : How my lord <eos> What cheer <eos> how is't with you best brother <eos> HERMIONE : You look as if you held a brow of much distraction Are you moved my lord <eos> LEONTES : No in good earnest <eos> How sometimes nature will betray its folly Its tenderness and make itself a pastime To harder bosoms <eos> Looking on the lines Of my boy's face methoughts I did recoil Twenty-three years and saw myself unbreech'd In my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled Lest it should bite its master and so prove As ornaments oft do too dangerous : How like methought I then was to this kernel This squash this gentleman <eos> Mine honest friend Will you take eggs for money <eos> MAMILLIUS : No my lord I'll fight <eos> LEONTES : You will <eos> why happy man be's dole <eos> My brother Are you so fond of your young prince as we Do seem to be of ours <eos> POLIXENES : If at home sir He's all my exercise my mirth my matter Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy My parasite my soldier statesman all : He makes a July's day short as December And with his varying childness cures in me Thoughts that would thick my blood <eos> LEONTES : So stands this squire Officed with me : we two will walk my lord And leave you to your graver steps <eos> Hermione How thou lovest us show in our brother's welcome Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap : Next to thyself and my young rover he's Apparent to my heart <eos> HERMIONE : If you would seek us We are yours i' the garden : shall's attend you there <eos> LEONTES : To your own bents dispose you : you'll be found Be you beneath the sky <eos> I am angling now Though you perceive me not how I give line <eos> Go to go to <eos> How she holds up the neb the bill to him <eos> And arms her with the boldness of a wife To her allowing husband <eos> Gone already <eos> Inch-thick knee-deep o'er head and ears a fork'd one <eos> Go play boy play : thy mother plays and I Play too but so disgraced a part whose issue Will hiss me to my grave : contempt and clamour Will be my knell <eos> Go play boy play <eos> There have been Or I am much deceived cuckolds ere now And many a man there is even at this present Now while I speak this holds his wife by the arm That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by Sir Smile his neighbour : nay there's comfort in't Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd As mine against their will <eos> Should all despair That have revolted wives the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves <eos> Physic for't there is none It is a bawdy planet that will strike Where 'tis predominant and 'tis powerful think it From east west north and south : be it concluded No barricado for a belly know't It will let in and out the enemy With bag and baggage : many thousand on's Have the disease and feel't not <eos> How now boy <eos> MAMILLIUS : I am like you they say <eos> LEONTES : Why that's some comfort <eos> What Camillo there <eos> CAMILLO : Ay my good lord <eos> LEONTES : Go play Mamillius thou'rt an honest man <eos> Camillo this great sir will yet stay longer <eos> CAMILLO : You had much ado to make his anchor hold : When you cast out it still came home <eos> LEONTES : Didst note it <eos> CAMILLO : He would not stay at your petitions : made His business more material <eos> LEONTES : Didst perceive it <eos> They're here with me already whispering rounding 'Sicilia is a so-forth :' 'tis far gone When I shall gust it last <eos> How came't Camillo That he did stay <eos> CAMILLO : At the good queen's entreaty <eos> LEONTES : At the queen's be't : 'good' should be pertinent But so it is it is not <eos> Was this taken By any understanding pate but thine <eos> For thy conceit is soaking will draw in More than the common blocks : not noted is't But of the finer natures <eos> by some severals Of head-piece extraordinary <eos> lower messes Perchance are to this business purblind <eos> say <eos> CAMILLO : Business my lord <eos> I think most understand Bohemia stays here longer <eos> LEONTES : Ha <eos> CAMILLO : Stays here longer <eos> LEONTES : Ay but why <eos> CAMILLO : To satisfy your highness and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress <eos> LEONTES : Satisfy <eos> The entreaties of your mistress <eos> satisfy <eos> Let that suffice <eos> I have trusted thee Camillo With all the nearest things to my heart as well My chamber-councils wherein priest-like thou Hast cleansed my bosom I from thee departed Thy penitent reform'd : but we have been Deceived in thy integrity deceived In that which seems so <eos> CAMILLO : Be it forbid my lord <eos> LEONTES : To bide upon't thou art not honest or If thou inclinest that way thou art a coward Which hoxes honesty behind restraining From course required or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust And therein negligent or else a fool That seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn And takest it all for jest <eos> CAMILLO : My gracious lord I may be negligent foolish and fearful In every one of these no man is free But that his negligence his folly fear Among the infinite doings of the world Sometime puts forth <eos> In your affairs my lord If ever I were wilful-negligent It was my folly if industriously I play'd the fool it was my negligence Not weighing well the end if ever fearful To do a thing where I the issue doubted Where of the execution did cry out Against the non-performance 'twas a fear Which oft infects the wisest : these my lord Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty Is never free of <eos> But beseech your grace Be plainer with me let me know my trespass By its own visage : if I then deny it 'Tis none of mine <eos> LEONTES : Ha' not you seen Camillo <eos> But that's past doubt you have or your eye-glass Is thicker than a cuckold's horn <eos>or heard <eos> For to a vision so apparent rumour Cannot be mute <eos>or thought <eos>for cogitation Resides not in that man that does not think <eos> My wife is slippery <eos> If thou wilt confess Or else be impudently negative To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say My wife's a hobby-horse deserves a name As rank as any flax-wench that puts to Before her troth-plight : say't and justify't <eos> CAMILLO : I would not be a stander-by to hear My sovereign mistress clouded so without My present vengeance taken : 'shrew my heart You never spoke what did become you less Than this which to reiterate were sin As deep as that though true <eos> LEONTES : Is whispering nothing <eos> Is leaning cheek to cheek <eos> is meeting noses <eos> Kissing with inside lip <eos> stopping the career Of laughing with a sigh <eos> <eos>a note infallible Of breaking honesty <eos>horsing foot on foot <eos> Skulking in corners <eos> wishing clocks more swift <eos> Hours minutes <eos> noon midnight <eos> and all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only That would unseen be wicked <eos> is this nothing <eos> Why then the world and all that's in't is nothing The covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothing My wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings If this be nothing <eos> CAMILLO : Good my lord be cured Of this diseased opinion and betimes For 'tis most dangerous <eos> LEONTES : Say it be 'tis true <eos> CAMILLO : No no my lord <eos> LEONTES : It is you lie you lie : I say thou liest Camillo and I hate thee Pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave Or else a hovering temporizer that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil Inclining to them both : were my wife's liver Infected as her life she would not live The running of one glass <eos> CAMILLO : Who does infect her <eos> LEONTES : Why he that wears her like a medal hanging About his neck Bohemia : who if I Had servants true about me that bare eyes To see alike mine honour as their profits Their own particular thrifts they would do that Which should undo more doing : ay and thou His cupbearer <eos>whom I from meaner form Have benched and reared to worship who mayst see Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven How I am galled <eos>mightst bespice a cup To give mine enemy a lasting wink Which draught to me were cordial <eos> CAMILLO : Sir my lord I could do this and that with no rash potion But with a lingering dram that should not work Maliciously like poison : but I cannot Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress So sovereignly being honourable <eos> I have loved thee <eos> LEONTES : Make that thy question and go rot <eos> Dost think I am so muddy so unsettled To appoint myself in this vexation sully The purity and whiteness of my sheets Which to preserve is sleep which being spotted Is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son Who I do think is mine and love as mine Without ripe moving to't <eos> Would I do this <eos> Could man so blench <eos> CAMILLO : I must believe you sir : I do and will fetch off Bohemia for't Provided that when he's removed your highness Will take again your queen as yours at first Even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms Known and allied to yours <eos> LEONTES : Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down : I'll give no blemish to her honour none <eos> CAMILLO : My lord Go then and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia And with your queen <eos> I am his cupbearer : If from me he have wholesome beverage Account me not your servant <eos> LEONTES : This is all : Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart Do't not thou split'st thine own <eos> CAMILLO : I'll do't my lord <eos> LEONTES : I will seem friendly as thou hast advised me <eos> CAMILLO : O miserable lady <eos> But for me What case stand I in <eos> I must be the poisoner Of good Polixenes and my ground to do't Is the obedience to a master one Who in rebellion with himself will have All that are his so too <eos> To do this deed Promotion follows <eos> If I could find example Of thousands that had struck anointed kings And flourish'd after I'ld not do't but since Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one Let villany itself forswear't <eos> I must Forsake the court : to do't or no is certain To me a break-neck <eos> Happy star reign now <eos> Here comes Bohemia <eos> POLIXENES : This is strange : methinks My favour here begins to warp <eos> Not speak <eos> Good day Camillo <eos> CAMILLO : Hail most royal sir <eos> POLIXENES : What is the news i' the court <eos> CAMILLO : None rare my lord <eos> POLIXENES : The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province and a region Loved as he loves himself : even now I met him With customary compliment when he Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling A lip of much contempt speeds from me and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changeth thus his manners <eos> CAMILLO : I dare not know my lord <eos> POLIXENES : How <eos> dare not <eos> do not <eos> Do you know and dare not <eos> Be intelligent to me : 'tis thereabouts For to yourself what you do know you must <eos> And cannot say you dare not <eos> Good Camillo Your changed complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine changed too for I must be A party in this alteration finding Myself thus alter'd with 't <eos> CAMILLO : There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper but I cannot name the disease and it is caught Of you that yet are well <eos> POLIXENES : How <eos> caught of me <eos> Make me not sighted like the basilisk : I have look'd on thousands who have sped the better By my regard but kill'd none so <eos> Camillo <eos> As you are certainly a gentleman thereto Clerk-like experienced which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents' noble names In whose success we are gentle <eos>I beseech you If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be inform'd imprison't not In ignorant concealment <eos> CAMILLO : I may not answer <eos> POLIXENES : A sickness caught of me and yet I well <eos> I must be answer'd <eos> Dost thou hear Camillo I conjure thee by all the parts of man Which honour does acknowledge whereof the least Is not this suit of mine that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me how far off how near Which way to be prevented if to be If not how best to bear it <eos> CAMILLO : Sir I will tell you Since I am charged in honour and by him That I think honourable : therefore mark my counsel Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as I mean to utter it or both yourself and me Cry lost and so good night <eos> POLIXENES : On good Camillo <eos> CAMILLO : I am appointed him to murder you <eos> POLIXENES : By whom Camillo <eos> CAMILLO : By the king <eos> POLIXENES : For what <eos> CAMILLO : He thinks nay with all confidence he swears As he had seen't or been an instrument To vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen Forbiddenly <eos> POLIXENES : O then my best blood turn To an infected jelly and my name Be yoked with his that did betray the Best <eos> Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive and my approach be shunn'd Nay hated too worse than the great'st infection That e'er was heard or read <eos> CAMILLO : Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The fabric of his folly whose foundation Is piled upon his faith and will continue The standing of his body <eos> POLIXENES : How should this grow <eos> CAMILLO : I know not : but I am sure 'tis safer to Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born <eos> If therefore you dare trust my honesty That lies enclosed in this trunk which you Shall bear along impawn'd away to-night <eos> Your followers I will whisper to the business And will by twos and threes at several posterns Clear them o' the city <eos> For myself I'll put My fortunes to your service which are here By this discovery lost <eos> Be not uncertain For by the honour of my parents I Have utter'd truth : which if you seek to prove I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth thereon His execution sworn <eos> POLIXENES : I do believe thee : I saw his heart in 's face <eos> Give me thy hand : Be pilot to me and thy places shall Still neighbour mine <eos> My ships are ready and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago <eos> This jealousy Is for a precious creature : as she's rare Must it be great and as his person's mighty Must it be violent and as he does conceive He is dishonour'd by a man which ever Profess'd to him why his revenges must In that be made more bitter <eos> Fear o'ershades me : Good expedition be my friend and comfort The gracious queen part of his theme but nothing Of his ill-ta'en suspicion <eos> Come Camillo I will respect thee as a father if Thou bear'st my life off hence : let us avoid <eos> CAMILLO : It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns : please your highness To take the urgent hour <eos> Come sir away <eos> HERMIONE : Take the boy to you : he so troubles me 'Tis past enduring <eos> First Lady : Come my gracious lord Shall I be your playfellow <eos> MAMILLIUS : No I'll none of you <eos> First Lady : Why my sweet lord <eos> MAMILLIUS : You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if I were a baby still <eos> I love you better <eos> Second Lady : And why so my lord <eos> MAMILLIUS : Not for because Your brows are blacker yet black brows they say Become some women best so that there be not Too much hair there but in a semicircle Or a half-moon made with a pen <eos> Second Lady : Who taught you this <eos> MAMILLIUS : I learnt it out of women's faces <eos> Pray now What colour are your eyebrows <eos> First Lady : Blue my lord <eos> MAMILLIUS : Nay that's a mock : I have seen a lady's nose That has been blue but not her eyebrows <eos> First Lady : Hark ye The queen your mother rounds apace : we shall Present our services to a fine new prince One of these days and then you'ld wanton with us If we would have you <eos> Second Lady : She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk : good time encounter her <eos> HERMIONE : What wisdom stirs amongst you <eos> Come sir now I am for you again : pray you sit by us And tell 's a tale <eos> MAMILLIUS : Merry or sad shall't be <eos> HERMIONE : As merry as you will <eos> MAMILLIUS : A sad tale's best for winter : I have one Of sprites and goblins <eos> HERMIONE : Let's have that good sir <eos> Come on sit down : come on and do your best To fright me with your sprites you're powerful at it <eos> MAMILLIUS : There was a man <eos> HERMIONE : Nay come sit down then on <eos> MAMILLIUS : Dwelt by a churchyard : I will tell it softly Yond crickets shall not hear it <eos> HERMIONE : Come on then And give't me in mine ear <eos> LEONTES : Was he met there <eos> his train <eos> Camillo with him <eos> First Lord : Behind the tuft of pines I met them never Saw I men scour so on their way : I eyed them Even to their ships <eos> LEONTES : How blest am I In my just censure in my true opinion <eos> Alack for lesser knowledge <eos> how accursed In being so blest <eos> There may be in the cup A spider steep'd and one may drink depart And yet partake no venom for his knowledge Is not infected : but if one present The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known How he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides With violent hefts <eos> I have drunk and seen the spider <eos> Camillo was his help in this his pander : There is a plot against my life my crown All's true that is mistrusted : that false villain Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him : He has discover'd my design and I Remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick For them to play at will <eos> How came the posterns So easily open <eos> First Lord : By his great authority Which often hath no less prevail'd than so On your command <eos> LEONTES : I know't too well <eos> Give me the boy : I am glad you did not nurse him : Though he does bear some signs of me yet you Have too much blood in him <eos> HERMIONE : What is this <eos> sport <eos> LEONTES : Bear the boy hence he shall not come about her Away with him <eos> and let her sport herself With that she's big with for 'tis Polixenes Has made thee swell thus <eos> HERMIONE : But I'ld say he had not And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying Howe'er you lean to the nayward <eos> LEONTES : You my lords Look on her mark her well be but about To say 'she is a goodly lady' and The justice of your bearts will thereto add 'Tis pity she's not honest honourable :' Praise her but for this her without-door form Which on my faith deserves high speech and straight The shrug the hum or ha these petty brands That calumny doth use <eos>O I am out <eos> That mercy does for calumny will sear Virtue itself : these shrugs these hums and ha's When you have said 'she's goodly' come between Ere you can say 'she's honest :' but be 't known From him that has most cause to grieve it should be She's an adulteress <eos> HERMIONE : Should a villain say so The most replenish'd villain in the world He were as much more villain : you my lord Do but mistake <eos> LEONTES : You have mistook my lady Polixenes for Leontes : O thou thing <eos> Which I'll not call a creature of thy place Lest barbarism making me the precedent Should a like language use to all degrees And mannerly distinguishment leave out Betwixt the prince and beggar : I have said She's an adulteress I have said with whom : More she's a traitor and Camillo is A federary with her and one that knows What she should shame to know herself But with her most vile principal that she's A bed-swerver even as bad as those That vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy To this their late escape <eos> HERMIONE : No by my life <eos> Privy to none of this <eos> How will this grieve you When you shall come to clearer knowledge that You thus have publish'd me <eos> Gentle my lord You scarce can right me throughly then to say You did mistake <eos> LEONTES : No if I mistake In those foundations which I build upon The centre is not big enough to bear A school-boy's top <eos> Away with her <eos> to prison <eos> He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty But that he speaks <eos> HERMIONE : There's some ill planet reigns : I must be patient till the heavens look With an aspect more favourable <eos> Good my lords I am not prone to weeping as our sex Commonly are the want of which vain dew Perchance shall dry your pities : but I have That honourable grief lodged here which burns Worse than tears drown : beseech you all my lords With thoughts so qualified as your charities Shall best instruct you measure me and so The king's will be perform'd <eos> LEONTES : Shall I be heard <eos> HERMIONE : Who is't that goes with me <eos> Beseech your highness My women may be with me for you see My plight requires it <eos> Do not weep good fools There is no cause : when you shall know your mistress Has deserved prison then abound in tears As I come out : this action I now go on Is for my better grace <eos> Adieu my lord : I never wish'd to see you sorry now I trust I shall <eos> My women come you have leave <eos> LEONTES : Go do our bidding hence <eos> First Lord : Beseech your highness call the queen again <eos> ANTIGONUS : Be certain what you do sir lest your justice Prove violence in the which three great ones suffer Yourself your queen your son <eos> First Lord : For her my lord I dare my life lay down and will do't sir Please you to accept it that the queen is spotless I' the eyes of heaven and to you I mean In this which you accuse her <eos> ANTIGONUS : If it prove She's otherwise I'll keep my stables where I lodge my wife I'll go in couples with her Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her For every inch of woman in the world Ay every dram of woman's flesh is false If she be <eos> LEONTES : Hold your peaces <eos> First Lord : Good my lord <eos> ANTIGONUS : It is for you we speak not for ourselves : You are abused and by some putter-on That will be damn'd for't would I knew the villain I would land-damn him <eos> Be she honour-flaw'd I have three daughters the eldest is eleven The second and the third nine and some five If this prove true they'll pay for't : by mine honour I'll geld 'em all fourteen they shall not see To bring false generations : they are co-heirs And I had rather glib myself than they Should not produce fair issue <eos> LEONTES : Cease no more <eos> You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead man's nose : but I do see't and feel't As you feel doing thus and see withal The instruments that feel <eos> ANTIGONUS : If it be so We need no grave to bury honesty : There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten Of the whole dungy earth <eos> LEONTES : What <eos> lack I credit <eos> First Lord : I had rather you did lack than I my lord Upon this ground and more it would content me To have her honour true than your suspicion Be blamed for't how you might <eos> LEONTES : Why what need we Commune with you of this but rather follow Our forceful instigation <eos> Our prerogative Calls not your counsels but our natural goodness Imparts this which if you or stupefied Or seeming so in skill cannot or will not Relish a truth like us inform yourselves We need no more of your advice : the matter The loss the gain the ordering on't is all Properly ours <eos> ANTIGONUS : And I wish my liege You had only in your silent judgment tried it Without more overture <eos> LEONTES : How could that be <eos> Either thou art most ignorant by age Or thou wert born a fool <eos> Camillo's flight Added to their familiarity Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture That lack'd sight only nought for approbation But only seeing all other circumstances Made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding : Yet for a greater confirmation For in an act of this importance 'twere Most piteous to be wild I have dispatch'd in post To sacred Delphos to Apollo's temple Cleomenes and Dion whom you know Of stuff'd sufficiency : now from the oracle They will bring all whose spiritual counsel had Shall stop or spur me <eos> Have I done well <eos> First Lord : Well done my lord <eos> LEONTES : Though I am satisfied and need no more Than what I know yet shall the oracle Give rest to the minds of others such as he Whose ignorant credulity will not Come up to the truth <eos> So have we thought it good From our free person she should be confined Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform <eos> Come follow us We are to speak in public for this business Will raise us all <eos> ANTIGONUS : PAULINA : The keeper of the prison call to him let him have knowledge who I am <eos> Good lady No court in Europe is too good for thee What dost thou then in prison <eos> Now good sir You know me do you not <eos> Gaoler : For a worthy lady And one whom much I honour <eos> PAULINA : Pray you then Conduct me to the queen <eos> Gaoler : I may not madam : To the contrary I have express commandment <eos> PAULINA : Here's ado To lock up honesty and honour from The access of gentle visitors <eos> Is't lawful pray you To see her women <eos> any of them <eos> Emilia <eos> Gaoler : So please you madam To put apart these your attendants I Shall bring Emilia forth <eos> PAULINA : I pray now call her <eos> Withdraw yourselves <eos> Gaoler : And madam I must be present at your conference <eos> PAULINA : Well be't so prithee <eos> Here's such ado to make no stain a stain As passes colouring <eos> Dear gentlewoman How fares our gracious lady <eos> EMILIA : As well as one so great and so forlorn May hold together : on her frights and griefs Which never tender lady hath born greater She is something before her time deliver'd <eos> PAULINA : A boy <eos> EMILIA : A daughter and a goodly babe Lusty and like to live : the queen receives Much comfort in't says 'My poor prisoner I am innocent as you <eos>' PAULINA : I dare be sworn These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king beshrew them <eos> He must be told on't and he shall : the office Becomes a woman best I'll take't upon me : If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister And never to my red-look'd anger be The trumpet any more <eos> Pray you Emilia Commend my best obedience to the queen : If she dares trust me with her little babe I'll show't the king and undertake to be Her advocate to the loud'st <eos> We do not know How he may soften at the sight o' the child : The silence often of pure innocence Persuades when speaking fails <eos> EMILIA : Most worthy madam Your honour and your goodness is so evident That your free undertaking cannot miss A thriving issue : there is no lady living So meet for this great errand <eos> Please your ladyship To visit the next room I'll presently Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer Who but to-day hammer'd of this design But durst not tempt a minister of honour Lest she should be denied <eos> PAULINA : Tell her Emilia <eos> I'll use that tongue I have : if wit flow from't As boldness from my bosom let 't not be doubted I shall do good <eos> EMILIA : Now be you blest for it <eos> I'll to the queen : please you come something nearer <eos> Gaoler : Madam if't please the queen to send the babe I know not what I shall incur to pass it Having no warrant <eos> PAULINA : You need not fear it sir : This child was prisoner to the womb and is By law and process of great nature thence Freed and enfranchised not a party to The anger of the king nor guilty of If any be the trespass of the queen <eos> Gaoler : I do believe it <eos> PAULINA : Do not you fear : upon mine honour I will stand betwixt you and danger <eos> LEONTES : Nor night nor day no rest : it is but weakness To bear the matter thus mere weakness <eos> If The cause were not in being <eos>part o' the cause She the adulteress for the harlot king Is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank And level of my brain plot-proof but she I can hook to me : say that she were gone Given to the fire a moiety of my rest Might come to me again <eos> Who's there <eos> First Servant : My lord <eos> LEONTES : How does the boy <eos> First Servant : He took good rest to-night 'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged <eos> LEONTES : To see his nobleness <eos> Conceiving the dishonour of his mother He straight declined droop'd took it deeply Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself Threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep And downright languish'd <eos> Leave me solely : go See how he fares <eos> Fie fie <eos> no thought of him : The thought of my revenges that way Recoil upon me : in himself too mighty And in his parties his alliance let him be Until a time may serve : for present vengeance Take it on her <eos> Camillo and Polixenes Laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow : They should not laugh if I could reach them nor Shall she within my power <eos> First Lord : You must not enter <eos> PAULINA : Nay rather good my lords be second to me : Fear you his tyrannous passion more alas Than the queen's life <eos> a gracious innocent soul More free than he is jealous <eos> ANTIGONUS : That's enough <eos> Second Servant : Madam he hath not slept tonight commanded None should come at him <eos> PAULINA : Not so hot good sir : I come to bring him sleep <eos> 'Tis such as you That creep like shadows by him and do sigh At each his needless heavings such as you Nourish the cause of his awaking : I Do come with words as medicinal as true Honest as either to purge him of that humour That presses him from sleep <eos> LEONTES : What noise there ho <eos> PAULINA : No noise my lord but needful conference About some gossips for your highness <eos> LEONTES : How <eos> Away with that audacious lady <eos> Antigonus I charged thee that she should not come about me : I knew she would <eos> ANTIGONUS : I told her so my lord On your displeasure's peril and on mine She should not visit you <eos> LEONTES : What canst not rule her <eos> PAULINA : From all dishonesty he can : in this Unless he take the course that you have done Commit me for committing honour trust it He shall not rule me <eos> ANTIGONUS : La you now you hear : When she will take the rein I let her run But she'll not stumble <eos> PAULINA : Good my liege I come And I beseech you hear me who profess Myself your loyal servant your physician Your most obedient counsellor yet that dare Less appear so in comforting your evils Than such as most seem yours : I say I come From your good queen <eos> LEONTES : Good queen <eos> PAULINA : Good queen my lord Good queen I say good queen And would by combat make her good so were I A man the worst about you <eos> LEONTES : Force her hence <eos> PAULINA : Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes First hand me : on mine own accord I'll off But first I'll do my errand <eos> The good queen For she is good hath brought you forth a daughter Here 'tis commends it to your blessing <eos> LEONTES : Out <eos> A mankind witch <eos> Hence with her out o' door : A most intelligencing bawd <eos> PAULINA : Not so : I am as ignorant in that as you In so entitling me and no less honest Than you are mad which is enough I'll warrant As this world goes to pass for honest <eos> LEONTES : Traitors <eos> Will you not push her out <eos> Give her the bastard <eos> Thou dotard <eos> thou art woman-tired unroosted By thy dame Partlet here <eos> Take up the bastard Take't up I say give't to thy crone <eos> PAULINA : For ever Unvenerable be thy hands if thou Takest up the princess by that forced baseness Which he has put upon't <eos> LEONTES : He dreads his wife <eos> PAULINA : So I would you did then 'twere past all doubt You'ld call your children yours <eos> LEONTES : A nest of traitors <eos> ANTIGONUS : I am none by this good light <eos> PAULINA : Nor I nor any But one that's here and that's himself for he The sacred honour of himself his queen's His hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander Whose sting is sharper than the sword's and will not <eos> For as the case now stands it is a curse He cannot be compell'd to't <eos>once remove The root of his opinion which is rotten As ever oak or stone was sound <eos> LEONTES : A callat Of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband And now baits me <eos> This brat is none of mine It is the issue of Polixenes : Hence with it and together with the dam Commit them to the fire <eos> PAULINA : It is yours And might we lay the old proverb to your charge So like you 'tis the worse <eos> Behold my lords Although the print be little the whole matter And copy of the father eye nose lip The trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek His smiles The very mould and frame of hand nail finger : And thou good goddess Nature which hast made it So like to him that got it if thou hast The ordering of the mind too 'mongst all colours No yellow in't lest she suspect as he does Her children not her husband's <eos> LEONTES : A gross hag And lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd That wilt not stay her tongue <eos> ANTIGONUS : Hang all the husbands That cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself Hardly one subject <eos> LEONTES : Once more take her hence <eos> PAULINA : A most unworthy and unnatural lord Can do no more <eos> LEONTES : I'll ha' thee burnt <eos> PAULINA : I care not : It is an heretic that makes the fire Not she which burns in't <eos> I'll not call you tyrant But this most cruel usage of your queen Not able to produce more accusation Than your own weak-hinged fancy something savours Of tyranny and will ignoble make you Yea scandalous to the world <eos> LEONTES : On your allegiance Out of the chamber with her <eos> Were I a tyrant Where were her life <eos> she durst not call me so If she did know me one <eos> Away with her <eos> PAULINA : I pray you do not push me I'll be gone <eos> Look to your babe my lord 'tis yours : Jove send her A better guiding spirit <eos> What needs these hands <eos> You that are thus so tender o'er his follies Will never do him good not one of you <eos> So so : farewell we are gone <eos> LEONTES : Thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this <eos> My child <eos> away with't <eos> Even thou that hast A heart so tender o'er it take it hence And see it instantly consumed with fire Even thou and none but thou <eos> Take it up straight : Within this hour bring me word 'tis done And by good testimony or I'll seize thy life With what thou else call'st thine <eos> If thou refuse And wilt encounter with my wrath say so The bastard brains with these my proper hands Shall I dash out <eos> Go take it to the fire For thou set'st on thy wife <eos> ANTIGONUS : I did not sir : These lords my noble fellows if they please Can clear me in't <eos> Lords : We can : my royal liege He is not guilty of her coming hither <eos> LEONTES : You're liars all <eos> First Lord : Beseech your highness give us better credit : We have always truly served you and beseech you So to esteem of us and on our knees we beg As recompense of our dear services Past and to come that you do change this purpose Which being so horrible so bloody must Lead on to some foul issue : we all kneel <eos> LEONTES : I am a feather for each wind that blows : Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel And call me father <eos> better burn it now Than curse it then <eos> But be it let it live <eos> It shall not neither <eos> You sir come you hither You that have been so tenderly officious With Lady Margery your midwife there To save this bastard's life <eos>for 'tis a bastard So sure as this beard's grey <eos>what will you adventure To save this brat's life <eos> ANTIGONUS : Any thing my lord That my ability may undergo And nobleness impose : at least thus much : I'll pawn the little blood which I have left To save the innocent : any thing possible <eos> LEONTES : It shall be possible <eos> Swear by this sword Thou wilt perform my bidding <eos> ANTIGONUS : I will my lord <eos> LEONTES : Mark and perform it see'st thou <eos> for the fail Of any point in't shall not only be Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife Whom for this time we pardon <eos> We enjoin thee As thou art liege-man to us that thou carry This female bastard hence and that thou bear it To some remote and desert place quite out Of our dominions and that there thou leave it Without more mercy to its own protection And favour of the climate <eos> As by strange fortune It came to us I do in justice charge thee On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture That thou commend it strangely to some place Where chance may nurse or end it <eos> Take it up <eos> ANTIGONUS : I swear to do this though a present death Had been more merciful <eos> Come on poor babe : Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens To be thy nurses <eos> Wolves and bears they say Casting their savageness aside have done Like offices of pity <eos> Sir be prosperous In more than this deed does require <eos> And blessing Against this cruelty fight on thy side Poor thing condemn'd to loss <eos> LEONTES : No I'll not rear Another's issue <eos> Servant : Please your highness posts From those you sent to the oracle are come An hour since : Cleomenes and Dion Being well arrived from Delphos are both landed Hasting to the court <eos> First Lord : So please you sir their speed Hath been beyond account <eos> LEONTES : Twenty-three days They have been absent : 'tis good speed foretells The great Apollo suddenly will have The truth of this appear <eos> Prepare you lords Summon a session that we may arraign Our most disloyal lady for as she hath Been publicly accused so shall she have A just and open trial <eos> While she lives My heart will be a burthen to me <eos> Leave me And think upon my bidding <eos> CLEOMENES : The climate's delicate the air most sweet Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing The common praise it bears <eos> DION : I shall report For most it caught me the celestial habits Methinks I so should term them and the reverence Of the grave wearers <eos> O the sacrifice <eos> How ceremonious solemn and unearthly It was i' the offering <eos> CLEOMENES : But of all the burst And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle Kin to Jove's thunder so surprised my sense <eos> That I was nothing <eos> DION : If the event o' the journey Prove as successful to the queen <eos>O be't so <eos> <eos> As it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy The time is worth the use on't <eos> CLEOMENES : Great Apollo Turn all to the best <eos> These proclamations So forcing faults upon Hermione I little like <eos> DION : The violent carriage of it Will clear or end the business : when the oracle Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up Shall the contents discover something rare Even then will rush to knowledge <eos> Go : fresh horses <eos> And gracious be the issue <eos> LEONTES : This sessions to our great grief we pronounce Even pushes 'gainst our heart : the party tried The daughter of a king our wife and one Of us too much beloved <eos> Let us be clear'd Of being tyrannous since we so openly Proceed in justice which shall have due course Even to the guilt or the purgation <eos> Produce the prisoner <eos> Officer : It is his highness' pleasure that the queen Appear in person here in court <eos> Silence <eos> LEONTES : Read the indictment <eos> Officer : HERMIONE : Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation and The testimony on my part no other But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me To say 'not guilty :' mine integrity Being counted falsehood shall as I express it Be so received <eos> But thus : if powers divine Behold our human actions as they do I doubt not then but innocence shall make False accusation blush and tyranny Tremble at patience <eos> You my lord best know Who least will seem to do so my past life Hath been as continent as chaste as true As I am now unhappy which is more Than history can pattern though devised And play'd to take spectators <eos> For behold me A fellow of the royal bed which owe A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter The mother to a hopeful prince here standing To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore Who please to come and hear <eos> For life I prize it As I weigh grief which I would spare : for honour 'Tis a derivative from me to mine And only that I stand for <eos> I appeal To your own conscience sir before Polixenes Came to your court how I was in your grace How merited to be so since he came With what encounter so uncurrent I Have strain'd to appear thus : if one jot beyond The bound of honour or in act or will That way inclining harden'd be the hearts Of all that hear me and my near'st of kin Cry fie upon my grave <eos> LEONTES : I ne'er heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it first <eos> HERMIONE : That's true enough Through 'tis a saying sir not due to me <eos> LEONTES : You will not own it <eos> HERMIONE : More than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault I must not At all acknowledge <eos> For Polixenes With whom I am accused I do confess I loved him as in honour he required With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me with a love even such So and no other as yourself commanded : Which not to have done I think had been in me Both disobedience and ingratitude To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke Even since it could speak from an infant freely That it was yours <eos> Now for conspiracy I know not how it tastes though it be dish'd For me to try how : all I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man And why he left your court the gods themselves Wotting no more than I are ignorant <eos> LEONTES : You knew of his departure as you know What you have underta'en to do in's absence <eos> HERMIONE : Sir You speak a language that I understand not : My life stands in the level of your dreams Which I'll lay down <eos> LEONTES : Your actions are my dreams You had a bastard by Polixenes And I but dream'd it <eos> As you were past all shame <eos> Those of your fact are so <eos>so past all truth : Which to deny concerns more than avails for as Thy brat hath been cast out like to itself No father owning it <eos>which is indeed More criminal in thee than it <eos>so thou Shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage Look for no less than death <eos> HERMIONE : Sir spare your threats : The bug which you would fright me with I seek <eos> To me can life be no commodity : The crown and comfort of my life your favour I do give lost for I do feel it gone But know not how it went <eos> My second joy And first-fruits of my body from his presence I am barr'd like one infectious <eos> My third comfort Starr'd most unluckily is from my breast The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth Haled out to murder : myself on every post Proclaimed a strumpet : with immodest hatred The child-bed privilege denied which 'longs To women of all fashion lastly hurried Here to this place i' the open air before I have got strength of limit <eos> Now my liege Tell me what blessings I have here alive That I should fear to die <eos> Therefore proceed <eos> But yet hear this : mistake me not no life I prize it not a straw but for mine honour Which I would free if I shall be condemn'd Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else But what your jealousies awake I tell you 'Tis rigor and not law <eos> Your honours all I do refer me to the oracle : Apollo be my judge <eos> First Lord : This your request Is altogether just : therefore bring forth And in Apollos name his oracle <eos> HERMIONE : The Emperor of Russia was my father : O that he were alive and here beholding His daughter's trial <eos> that he did but see The flatness of my misery yet with eyes Of pity not revenge <eos> Officer : You here shall swear upon this sword of justice That you Cleomenes and Dion have Been both at Delphos and from thence have brought The seal'd-up oracle by the hand deliver'd Of great Apollo's priest and that since then You have not dared to break the holy seal Nor read the secrets in't <eos> CLEOMENES : All this we swear <eos> LEONTES : Break up the seals and read <eos> Officer : Lords : Now blessed be the great Apollo <eos> HERMIONE : Praised <eos> LEONTES : Hast thou read truth <eos> Officer : Ay my lord even so As it is here set down <eos> LEONTES : There is no truth at all i' the oracle : The sessions shall proceed : this is mere falsehood <eos> Servant : My lord the king the king <eos> LEONTES : What is the business <eos> Servant : O sir I shall be hated to report it <eos> The prince your son with mere conceit and fear Of the queen's speed is gone <eos> LEONTES : How <eos> gone <eos> Servant : Is dead <eos> LEONTES : Apollo's angry and the heavens themselves Do strike at my injustice <eos> How now there <eos> PAULINA : This news is mortal to the queen : look down And see what death is doing <eos> LEONTES : Take her hence : Her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover : I have too much believed mine own suspicion : Beseech you tenderly apply to her Some remedies for life <eos> Apollo pardon My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle <eos> I'll reconcile me to Polixenes New woo my queen recall the good Camillo Whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy For being transported by my jealousies To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose Camillo for the minister to poison My friend Polixenes : which had been done But that the good mind of Camillo tardied My swift command though I with death and with Reward did threaten and encourage him Not doing 't and being done : he most humane And fill'd with honour to my kingly guest Unclasp'd my practise quit his fortunes here Which you knew great and to the hazard Of all encertainties himself commended No richer than his honour : how he glisters Thorough my rust <eos> and how his pity Does my deeds make the blacker <eos> PAULINA : Woe the while <eos> O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it Break too <eos> First Lord : What fit is this good lady <eos> PAULINA : What studied torments tyrant hast for me <eos> What wheels <eos> racks <eos> fires <eos> what flaying <eos> boiling <eos> In leads or oils <eos> what old or newer torture Must I receive whose every word deserves To taste of thy most worst <eos> Thy tyranny Together working with thy jealousies Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle For girls of nine O think what they have done And then run mad indeed stark mad <eos> for all Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it <eos> That thou betray'dst Polixenes'twas nothing That did but show thee of a fool inconstant And damnable ingrateful : nor was't much Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour To have him kill a king : poor trespasses More monstrous standing by : whereof I reckon The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter To be or none or little though a devil Would have shed water out of fire ere done't : Nor is't directly laid to thee the death Of the young prince whose honourable thoughts Thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart That could conceive a gross and foolish sire Blemish'd his gracious dam : this is not no Laid to thy answer : but the last <eos>O lords When I have said cry 'woe <eos>' the queen the queen The sweet'st dear'st creature's dead and vengeance for't Not dropp'd down yet <eos> First Lord : The higher powers forbid <eos> PAULINA : I say she's dead I'll swear't <eos> If word nor oath Prevail not go and see : if you can bring Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye Heat outwardly or breath within I'll serve you As I would do the gods <eos> But O thou tyrant <eos> Do not repent these things for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee To nothing but despair <eos> A thousand knees Ten thousand years together naked fasting Upon a barren mountain and still winter In storm perpetual could not move the gods To look that way thou wert <eos> LEONTES : Go on go on Thou canst not speak too much I have deserved All tongues to talk their bitterest <eos> First Lord : Say no more : Howe'er the business goes you have made fault I' the boldness of your speech <eos> PAULINA : I am sorry for't : All faults I make when I shall come to know them I do repent <eos> Alas <eos> I have show'd too much The rashness of a woman : he is touch'd To the noble heart <eos> What's gone and what's past help Should be past grief : do not receive affliction At my petition I beseech you rather Let me be punish'd that have minded you Of what you should forget <eos> Now good my liege Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman : The love I bore your queen <eos>lo fool again <eos> <eos> I'll speak of her no more nor of your children I'll not remember you of my own lord Who is lost too : take your patience to you And I'll say nothing <eos> LEONTES : Thou didst speak but well When most the truth which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee <eos> Prithee bring me To the dead bodies of my queen and son : One grave shall be for both : upon them shall The causes of their death appear unto Our shame perpetual <eos> Once a day I'll visit The chapel where they lie and tears shed there Shall be my recreation : so long as nature Will bear up with this exercise so long I daily vow to use it <eos> Come and lead me Unto these sorrows <eos> ANTIGONUS : Thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon The deserts of Bohemia <eos> Mariner : Ay my lord : and fear We have landed in ill time : the skies look grimly And threaten present blusters <eos> In my conscience The heavens with that we have in hand are angry And frown upon 's <eos> ANTIGONUS : Their sacred wills be done <eos> Go get aboard Look to thy bark : I'll not be long before I call upon thee <eos> Mariner : Make your best haste and go not Too far i' the land : 'tis like to be loud weather Besides this place is famous for the creatures Of prey that keep upon't <eos> ANTIGONUS : Go thou away : I'll follow instantly <eos> Mariner : I am glad at heart To be so rid o' the business <eos> ANTIGONUS : Come poor babe : I have heard but not believed the spirits o' the dead May walk again : if such thing be thy mother Appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream So like a waking <eos> To me comes a creature Sometimes her head on one side some another I never saw a vessel of like sorrow So fill'd and so becoming : in pure white robes Like very sanctity she did approach My cabin where I lay thrice bow'd before me And gasping to begin some speech her eyes Became two spouts : the fury spent anon Did this break-from her : 'Good Antigonus Since fate against thy better disposition Hath made thy person for the thrower-out Of my poor babe according to thine oath Places remote enough are in Bohemia There weep and leave it crying and for the babe Is counted lost for ever Perdita I prithee call't <eos> For this ungentle business Put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see Thy wife Paulina more <eos>' And so with shrieks She melted into air <eos> Affrighted much I did in time collect myself and thought This was so and no slumber <eos> Dreams are toys : Yet for this once yea superstitiously I will be squared by this <eos> I do believe Hermione hath suffer'd death and that Apollo would this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes it should here be laid Either for life or death upon the earth Of its right father <eos> Blossom speed thee well <eos> There lie and there thy character : there these Which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty And still rest thine <eos> The storm begins poor wretch That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed To loss and what may follow <eos> Weep I cannot But my heart bleeds and most accursed am I To be by oath enjoin'd to this <eos> Farewell <eos> The day frowns more and more : thou'rt like to have A lullaby too rough : I never saw The heavens so dim by day <eos> A savage clamour <eos> Well may I get aboard <eos> This is the chase : I am gone for ever <eos> Shepherd : I would there were no age between sixteen and three-and-twenty or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry stealing fighting <eos>Hark you now <eos> Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather <eos> They have scared away two of my best sheep which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master : if any where I have them 'tis by the seaside browsing of ivy <eos> Good luck an't be thy will what have we here <eos> Mercy on 's a barne a very pretty barne <eos> A boy or a child I wonder <eos> A pretty one a very pretty one : sure some 'scape : though I am not bookish yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape <eos> This has been some stair-work some trunk-work some behind-door-work : they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here <eos> I'll take it up for pity : yet I'll tarry till my son come he hallooed but even now <eos> Whoa ho hoa <eos> Clown : Hilloa loa <eos> Shepherd : What art so near <eos> If thou'lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten come hither <eos> What ailest thou man <eos> Clown : I have seen two such sights by sea and by land <eos> but I am not to say it is a sea for it is now the sky : betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin's point <eos> Shepherd : Why boy how is it <eos> Clown : I would you did but see how it chafes how it rages how it takes up the shore <eos> but that's not the point <eos> O the most piteous cry of the poor souls <eos> sometimes to see 'em and not to see 'em now the ship boring the moon with her main-mast and anon swallowed with yest and froth as you'ld thrust a cork into a hogshead <eos> And then for the land-service to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus a nobleman <eos> But to make an end of the ship to see how the sea flap-dragoned it : but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than the sea or weather <eos> Shepherd : Name of mercy when was this boy <eos> Clown : Now now : I have not winked since I saw these sights : the men are not yet cold under water nor the bear half dined on the gentleman : he's at it now <eos> Shepherd : Would I had been by to have helped the old man <eos> Clown : I would you had been by the ship side to have helped her : there your charity would have lacked footing <eos> Shepherd : Heavy matters <eos> heavy matters <eos> but look thee here boy <eos> Now bless thyself : thou mettest with things dying I with things newborn <eos> Here's a sight for thee look thee a bearing-cloth for a squire's child <eos> look thee here take up take up boy open't <eos> So let's see : it was told me I should be rich by the fairies <eos> This is some changeling : open't <eos> What's within boy <eos> Clown : You're a made old man : if the sins of your youth are forgiven you you're well to live <eos> Gold <eos> all gold <eos> Shepherd : This is fairy gold boy and 'twill prove so : up with't keep it close : home home the next way <eos> We are lucky boy and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy <eos> Let my sheep go : come good boy the next way home <eos> Clown : Go you the next way with your findings <eos> I'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten : they are never curst but when they are hungry : if there be any of him left I'll bury it <eos> Shepherd : That's a good deed <eos> If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is fetch me to the sight of him <eos> Clown : Marry will I and you shall help to put him i' the ground <eos> Shepherd : 'Tis a lucky day boy and we'll do good deeds on't <eos> Time : I that please some try all both joy and terror Of good and bad that makes and unfolds error Now take upon me in the name of Time To use my wings <eos> Impute it not a crime To me or my swift passage that I slide O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap since it is in my power To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour To plant and o'erwhelm custom <eos> Let me pass The same I am ere ancient'st order was Or what is now received : I witness to The times that brought them in so shall I do To the freshest things now reigning and make stale The glistering of this present as my tale Now seems to it <eos> Your patience this allowing I turn my glass and give my scene such growing As you had slept between : Leontes leaving The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving That he shuts up himself imagine me Gentle spectators that I now may be In fair Bohemia and remember well I mentioned a son o' the king's which Florizel I now name to you and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita now grown in grace Equal with wondering : what of her ensues I list not prophecy but let Time's news Be known when 'tis brought forth <eos> A shepherd's daughter And what to her adheres which follows after Is the argument of Time <eos> Of this allow If ever you have spent time worse ere now If never yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never may <eos> POLIXENES : I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate : 'tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to grant this <eos> CAMILLO : It is fifteen years since I saw my country : though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there <eos> Besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I o'erween to think so which is another spur to my departure <eos> POLIXENES : As thou lovest me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now : the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee : thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships <eos> Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented <eos> Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my son <eos> Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues <eos> CAMILLO : Sir it is three days since I saw the prince <eos> What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown : but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared <eos> POLIXENES : I have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate <eos> CAMILLO : I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note : the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage <eos> POLIXENES : That's likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither <eos> Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither <eos> Prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia <eos> CAMILLO : I willingly obey your command <eos> POLIXENES : My best Camillo <eos> We must disguise ourselves <eos> AUTOLYCUS : When daffodils begin to peer With heigh <eos> the doxy over the dale Why then comes in the sweet o' the year For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale <eos> The white sheet bleaching on the hedge With heigh <eos> the sweet birds O how they sing <eos> Doth set my pugging tooth on edge For a quart of ale is a dish for a king <eos> The lark that tirra-lyra chants With heigh <eos> with heigh <eos> the thrush and the jay Are summer songs for me and my aunts While we lie tumbling in the hay <eos> I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore three-pile but now I am out of service : But shall I go mourn for that my dear <eos> The pale moon shines by night : And when I wander here and there I then do most go right <eos> If tinkers may have leave to live And bear the sow-skin budget Then my account I well may give And in the stocks avouch it <eos> My traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen <eos> My father named me Autolycus who being as I am littered under Mercury was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles <eos> With die and drab I purchased this caparison and my revenue is the silly cheat <eos> Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway : beating and hanging are terrors to me : for the life to come I sleep out the thought of it <eos> A prize <eos> a prize <eos> Clown : Let me see : every 'leven wether tods every tod yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred shorn <eos> what comes the wool to <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Clown : I cannot do't without counters <eos> Let me see what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast <eos> Three pound of sugar five pound of currants rice <eos>what will this sister of mine do with rice <eos> But my father hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it on <eos> She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for the shearers three-man-song-men all and very good ones but they are most of them means and bases but one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to horn-pipes <eos> I must have saffron to colour the warden pies mace dates <eos> <eos>none that's out of my note nutmegs seven a race or two of ginger but that I may beg four pound of prunes and as many of raisins o' the sun <eos> AUTOLYCUS : O that ever I was born <eos> Clown : I' the name of me <eos> AUTOLYCUS : O help me help me <eos> pluck but off these rags and then death death <eos> Clown : Alack poor soul <eos> thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off <eos> AUTOLYCUS : O sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received which are mighty ones and millions <eos> Clown : Alas poor man <eos> a million of beating may come to a great matter <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel ta'en from me and these detestable things put upon me <eos> Clown : What by a horseman or a footman <eos> AUTOLYCUS : A footman sweet sir a footman <eos> Clown : Indeed he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee : if this be a horseman's coat it hath seen very hot service <eos> Lend me thy hand I'll help thee : come lend me thy hand <eos> AUTOLYCUS : O good sir tenderly O <eos> Clown : Alas poor soul <eos> AUTOLYCUS : O good sir softly good sir <eos> I fear sir my shoulder-blade is out <eos> Clown : How now <eos> canst stand <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Clown : Dost lack any money <eos> I have a little money for thee <eos> AUTOLYCUS : No good sweet sir no I beseech you sir : I have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence unto whom I was going I shall there have money or any thing I want : offer me no money I pray you that kills my heart <eos> Clown : What manner of fellow was he that robbed you <eos> AUTOLYCUS : A fellow sir that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames I knew him once a servant of the prince : I cannot tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court <eos> Clown : His vices you would say there's no virtue whipped out of the court : they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Vices I would say sir <eos> I know this man well : he hath been since an ape-bearer then a process-server a bailiff then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinker's wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue : some call him Autolycus <eos> Clown : Out upon him <eos> prig for my life prig : he haunts wakes fairs and bear-baitings <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Very true sir he sir he that's the rogue that put me into this apparel <eos> Clown : Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia : if you had but looked big and spit at him he'ld have run <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I must confess to you sir I am no fighter : I am false of heart that way and that he knew I warrant him <eos> Clown : How do you now <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Sweet sir much better than I was I can stand and walk : I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman's <eos> Clown : Shall I bring thee on the way <eos> AUTOLYCUS : No good-faced sir no sweet sir <eos> Clown : Then fare thee well : I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Prosper you sweet sir <eos> Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice <eos> I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too : if I make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue <eos> Jog on jog on the foot-path way And merrily hent the stile-a : A merry heart goes all the day Your sad tires in a mile-a <eos> FLORIZEL : These your unusual weeds to each part of you Do give a life : no shepherdess but Flora Peering in April's front <eos> This your sheep-shearing Is as a meeting of the petty gods And you the queen on't <eos> PERDITA : Sir my gracious lord To chide at your extremes it not becomes me : O pardon that I name them <eos> Your high self The gracious mark o' the land you have obscured With a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid Most goddess-like prank'd up : but that our feasts In every mess have folly and the feeders Digest it with a custom I should blush To see you so attired sworn I think To show myself a glass <eos> FLORIZEL : I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy father's ground <eos> PERDITA : Now Jove afford you cause <eos> To me the difference forges dread your greatness Hath not been used to fear <eos> Even now I tremble To think your father by some accident Should pass this way as you did : O the Fates <eos> How would he look to see his work so noble Vilely bound up <eos> What would he say <eos> Or how Should I in these my borrow'd flaunts behold The sternness of his presence <eos> FLORIZEL : Apprehend Nothing but jollity <eos> The gods themselves Humbling their deities to love have taken The shapes of beasts upon them : Jupiter Became a bull and bellow'd the green Neptune A ram and bleated and the fire-robed god Golden Apollo a poor humble swain As I seem now <eos> Their transformations Were never for a piece of beauty rarer Nor in a way so chaste since my desires Run not before mine honour nor my lusts Burn hotter than my faith <eos> PERDITA : O but sir Your resolution cannot hold when 'tis Opposed as it must be by the power of the king : One of these two must be necessities Which then will speak that you must change this purpose Or I my life <eos> FLORIZEL : Thou dearest Perdita With these forced thoughts I prithee darken not The mirth o' the feast <eos> Or I'll be thine my fair Or not my father's <eos> For I cannot be Mine own nor any thing to any if I be not thine <eos> To this I am most constant Though destiny say no <eos> Be merry gentle Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing That you behold the while <eos> Your guests are coming : Lift up your countenance as it were the day Of celebration of that nuptial which We two have sworn shall come <eos> PERDITA : O lady Fortune Stand you auspicious <eos> FLORIZEL : See your guests approach : Address yourself to entertain them sprightly And let's be red with mirth <eos> Shepherd : Fie daughter <eos> when my old wife lived upon This day she was both pantler butler cook Both dame and servant welcomed all served all Would sing her song and dance her turn now here At upper end o' the table now i' the middle On his shoulder and his her face o' fire With labour and the thing she took to quench it She would to each one sip <eos> You are retired As if you were a feasted one and not The hostess of the meeting : pray you bid These unknown friends to's welcome for it is A way to make us better friends more known <eos> Come quench your blushes and present yourself That which you are mistress o' the feast : come on And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing As your good flock shall prosper <eos> PERDITA : POLIXENES : Shepherdess A fair one are you <eos>well you fit our ages With flowers of winter <eos> PERDITA : Sir the year growing ancient Not yet on summer's death nor on the birth Of trembling winter the fairest flowers o' the season Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors Which some call nature's bastards : of that kind Our rustic garden's barren and I care not To get slips of them <eos> POLIXENES : Wherefore gentle maiden Do you neglect them <eos> PERDITA : For I have heard it said There is an art which in their piedness shares With great creating nature <eos> POLIXENES : Say there be Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean : so over that art Which you say adds to nature is an art That nature makes <eos> You see sweet maid we marry A gentler scion to the wildest stock And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race : this is an art Which does mend nature change it rather but The art itself is nature <eos> PERDITA : So it is <eos> POLIXENES : Then make your garden rich in gillyvors And do not call them bastards <eos> PERDITA : I'll not put The dibble in earth to set one slip of them No more than were I painted I would wish This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore Desire to breed by me <eos> Here's flowers for you Hot lavender mints savoury marjoram The marigold that goes to bed wi' the sun And with him rises weeping : these are flowers Of middle summer and I think they are given To men of middle age <eos> You're very welcome <eos> CAMILLO : I should leave grazing were I of your flock And only live by gazing <eos> PERDITA : Out alas <eos> You'd be so lean that blasts of January Would blow you through and through <eos> Now my fair'st friend I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might Become your time of day and yours and yours That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your maidenheads growing : O Proserpina For the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall From Dis's waggon <eos> daffodils That come before the swallow dares and take The winds of March with beauty violets dim But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes Or Cytherea's breath pale primroses That die unmarried ere they can behold Bight Phoebus in his strength <eos>a malady Most incident to maids bold oxlips and The crown imperial lilies of all kinds The flower-de-luce being one <eos> O these I lack To make you garlands of and my sweet friend To strew him o'er and o'er <eos> FLORIZEL : What like a corse <eos> PERDITA : No like a bank for love to lie and play on Not like a corse or if not to be buried But quick and in mine arms <eos> Come take your flowers : Methinks I play as I have seen them do In Whitsun pastorals : sure this robe of mine Does change my disposition <eos> FLORIZEL : What you do Still betters what is done <eos> When you speak sweet <eos> I'ld have you do it ever : when you sing I'ld have you buy and sell so so give alms Pray so and for the ordering your affairs To sing them too : when you do dance I wish you A wave o' the sea that you might ever do Nothing but that move still still so And own no other function : each your doing So singular in each particular Crowns what you are doing in the present deed That all your acts are queens <eos> PERDITA : O Doricles Your praises are too large : but that your youth And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd With wisdom I might fear my Doricles You woo'd me the false way <eos> FLORIZEL : I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to't <eos> But come our dance I pray : Your hand my Perdita : so turtles pair That never mean to part <eos> PERDITA : I'll swear for 'em <eos> POLIXENES : This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever Ran on the green-sward : nothing she does or seems But smacks of something greater than herself Too noble for this place <eos> CAMILLO : He tells her something That makes her blood look out : good sooth she is The queen of curds and cream <eos> Clown : Come on strike up <eos> DORCAS : Mopsa must be your mistress : marry garlic To mend her kissing with <eos> MOPSA : Now in good time <eos> Clown : Not a word a word we stand upon our manners <eos> Come strike up <eos> POLIXENES : Pray good shepherd what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter <eos> Shepherd : They call him Doricles and boasts himself To have a worthy feeding : but I have it Upon his own report and I believe it He looks like sooth <eos> He says he loves my daughter : I think so too for never gazed the moon Upon the water as he'll stand and read As 'twere my daughter's eyes : and to be plain <eos> I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best <eos> POLIXENES : She dances featly <eos> Shepherd : So she does any thing though I report it That should be silent : if young Doricles Do light upon her she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of <eos> Servant : O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you would never dance again after a tabour and pipe no the bagpipe could not move you : he sings several tunes faster than you'll tell money he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's ears grew to his tunes <eos> Clown : He could never come better he shall come in <eos> I love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably <eos> Servant : He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves : he has the prettiest love-songs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with such delicate burthens of dildos and fadings 'jump her and thump her' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop do me no harm good man' puts him off slights him with 'Whoop do me no harm good man <eos>' POLIXENES : This is a brave fellow <eos> Clown : Believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow <eos> Has he any unbraided wares <eos> Servant : He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle though they come to him by the gross : inkles caddisses cambrics lawns : why he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses you would think a smock were a she-angel he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't <eos> Clown : Prithee bring him in and let him approach singing <eos> PERDITA : Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes <eos> Clown : You have of these pedlars that have more in them than you'ld think sister <eos> PERDITA : Ay good brother or go about to think <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Lawn as white as driven snow Cyprus black as e'er was crow Gloves as sweet as damask roses Masks for faces and for noses Bugle bracelet necklace amber Perfume for a lady's chamber Golden quoifs and stomachers For my lads to give their dears : Pins and poking-sticks of steel What maids lack from head to heel : Come buy of me come come buy come buy Buy lads or else your lasses cry : Come buy <eos> Clown : If I were not in love with Mopsa thou shouldst take no money of me but being enthralled as I am it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves <eos> MOPSA : I was promised them against the feast but they come not too late now <eos> DORCAS : He hath promised you more than that or there be liars <eos> MOPSA : He hath paid you all he promised you may be he has paid you more which will shame you to give him again <eos> Clown : Is there no manners left among maids <eos> will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces <eos> Is there not milking-time when you are going to bed or kiln-hole to whistle off these secrets but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests <eos> 'tis well they are whispering : clamour your tongues and not a word more <eos> MOPSA : I have done <eos> Come you promised me a tawdry-lace and a pair of sweet gloves <eos> Clown : Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money <eos> AUTOLYCUS : And indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it behoves men to be wary <eos> Clown : Fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I hope so sir for I have about me many parcels of charge <eos> Clown : What hast here <eos> ballads <eos> MOPSA : Pray now buy some : I love a ballad in print o' life for then we are sure they are true <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Here's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and toads carbonadoed <eos> MOPSA : Is it true think you <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Very true and but a month old <eos> DORCAS : Bless me from marrying a usurer <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Here's the midwife's name to't one Mistress Tale-porter and five or six honest wives that were present <eos> Why should I carry lies abroad <eos> MOPSA : Pray you now buy it <eos> Clown : Come on lay it by : and let's first see moe ballads we'll buy the other things anon <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Here's another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids : it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her : the ballad is very pitiful and as true <eos> DORCAS : Is it true too think you <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Five justices' hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold <eos> Clown : Lay it by too : another <eos> AUTOLYCUS : This is a merry ballad but a very pretty one <eos> MOPSA : Let's have some merry ones <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Why this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man :' there's scarce a maid westward but she sings it 'tis in request I can tell you <eos> MOPSA : We can both sing it : if thou'lt bear a part thou shalt hear 'tis in three parts <eos> DORCAS : We had the tune on't a month ago <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I can bear my part you must know 'tis my occupation have at it with you <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Get you hence for I must go Where it fits not you to know <eos> DORCAS : Whither <eos> MOPSA : O whither <eos> DORCAS : Whither <eos> MOPSA : It becomes thy oath full well Thou to me thy secrets tell <eos> DORCAS : Me too let me go thither <eos> MOPSA : Or thou goest to the orange or mill <eos> DORCAS : If to either thou dost ill <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Neither <eos> DORCAS : What neither <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Neither <eos> DORCAS : Thou hast sworn my love to be <eos> MOPSA : Thou hast sworn it more to me : Then whither goest <eos> say whither <eos> Clown : We'll have this song out anon by ourselves : my father and the gentlemen are in sad talk and we'll not trouble them <eos> Come bring away thy pack after me <eos> Wenches I'll buy for you both <eos> Pedlar let's have the first choice <eos> Follow me girls <eos> AUTOLYCUS : And you shall pay well for 'em <eos> Will you buy any tape Or lace for your cape My dainty duck my dear-a <eos> Any silk any thread Any toys for your head Of the new'st and finest finest wear-a <eos> Come to the pedlar Money's a medler <eos> That doth utter all men's ware-a <eos> Servant : Master there is three carters three shepherds three neat-herds three swine-herds that have made themselves all men of hair they call themselves Saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are not in't but they themselves are o' the mind if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling it will please plentifully <eos> Shepherd : Away <eos> we'll none on 't : here has been too much homely foolery already <eos> I know sir we weary you <eos> POLIXENES : You weary those that refresh us : pray let's see these four threes of herdsmen <eos> Servant : One three of them by their own report sir hath danced before the king and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier <eos> Shepherd : Leave your prating : since these good men are pleased let them come in but quickly now <eos> Servant : Why they stay at door sir <eos> POLIXENES : O father you'll know more of that hereafter <eos> Is it not too far gone <eos> 'Tis time to part them <eos> He's simple and tells much <eos> How now fair shepherd <eos> Your heart is full of something that does take Your mind from feasting <eos> Sooth when I was young And handed love as you do I was wont To load my she with knacks : I would have ransack'd The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it To her acceptance you have let him go And nothing marted with him <eos> If your lass Interpretation should abuse and call this Your lack of love or bounty you were straited For a reply at least if you make a care Of happy holding her <eos> FLORIZEL : Old sir I know She prizes not such trifles as these are : The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd Up in my heart which I have given already But not deliver'd <eos> O hear me breathe my life Before this ancient sir who it should seem Hath sometime loved <eos> I take thy hand this hand As soft as dove's down and as white as it Or Ethiopian's tooth or the fann'd snow that's bolted By the northern blasts twice o'er <eos> POLIXENES : What follows this <eos> How prettily the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before <eos> I have put you out : But to your protestation let me hear What you profess <eos> FLORIZEL : Do and be witness to 't <eos> POLIXENES : And this my neighbour too <eos> FLORIZEL : And he and more Than he and men the earth the heavens and all : That were I crown'd the most imperial monarch Thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth That ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge More than was ever man's I would not prize them Without her love for her employ them all Commend them and condemn them to her service Or to their own perdition <eos> POLIXENES : Fairly offer'd <eos> CAMILLO : This shows a sound affection <eos> Shepherd : But my daughter Say you the like to him <eos> PERDITA : I cannot speak So well nothing so well no nor mean better : By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The purity of his <eos> Shepherd : Take hands a bargain <eos> And friends unknown you shall bear witness to 't : I give my daughter to him and will make Her portion equal his <eos> FLORIZEL : O that must be I' the virtue of your daughter : one being dead I shall have more than you can dream of yet Enough then for your wonder <eos> But come on Contract us 'fore these witnesses <eos> Shepherd : Come your hand And daughter yours <eos> POLIXENES : Soft swain awhile beseech you Have you a father <eos> FLORIZEL : I have : but what of him <eos> POLIXENES : Knows he of this <eos> FLORIZEL : He neither does nor shall <eos> POLIXENES : Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table <eos> Pray you once more Is not your father grown incapable Of reasonable affairs <eos> is he not stupid With age and altering rheums <eos> can he speak <eos> hear <eos> Know man from man <eos> dispute his own estate <eos> Lies he not bed-rid <eos> and again does nothing But what he did being childish <eos> FLORIZEL : No good sir He has his health and ampler strength indeed Than most have of his age <eos> POLIXENES : By my white beard You offer him if this be so a wrong Something unfilial : reason my son Should choose himself a wife but as good reason The father all whose joy is nothing else But fair posterity should hold some counsel In such a business <eos> FLORIZEL : I yield all this But for some other reasons my grave sir Which 'tis not fit you know I not acquaint My father of this business <eos> POLIXENES : Let him know't <eos> FLORIZEL : He shall not <eos> POLIXENES : Prithee let him <eos> FLORIZEL : No he must not <eos> Shepherd : Let him my son : he shall not need to grieve At knowing of thy choice <eos> FLORIZEL : Come come he must not <eos> Mark our contract <eos> POLIXENES : Mark your divorce young sir Whom son I dare not call thou art too base To be acknowledged : thou a sceptre's heir That thus affect'st a sheep-hook <eos> Thou old traitor I am sorry that by hanging thee I can But shorten thy life one week <eos> And thou fresh piece Of excellent witchcraft who of force must know The royal fool thou copest with <eos> Shepherd : O my heart <eos> POLIXENES : I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made More homely than thy state <eos> For thee fond boy If I may ever know thou dost but sigh That thou no more shalt see this knack as never I mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin Far than Deucalion off : mark thou my words : Follow us to the court <eos> Thou churl for this time Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee From the dead blow of it <eos> And you enchantment <eos> <eos> Worthy enough a herdsman : yea him too That makes himself but for our honour therein Unworthy thee <eos>if ever henceforth thou These rural latches to his entrance open Or hoop his body more with thy embraces I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender to't <eos> PERDITA : Even here undone <eos> I was not much afeard for once or twice I was about to speak and tell him plainly The selfsame sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottage but Looks on alike <eos> Will't please you sir be gone <eos> I told you what would come of this : beseech you Of your own state take care : this dream of mine <eos> Being now awake I'll queen it no inch farther But milk my ewes and weep <eos> CAMILLO : Why how now father <eos> Speak ere thou diest <eos> Shepherd : I cannot speak nor think Nor dare to know that which I know <eos> O sir <eos> You have undone a man of fourscore three That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea To die upon the bed my father died To lie close by his honest bones : but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me Where no priest shovels in dust <eos> O cursed wretch That knew'st this was the prince and wouldst adventure To mingle faith with him <eos> Undone <eos> undone <eos> If I might die within this hour I have lived To die when I desire <eos> FLORIZEL : Why look you so upon me <eos> I am but sorry not afeard delay'd But nothing alter'd : what I was I am More straining on for plucking back not following My leash unwillingly <eos> CAMILLO : Gracious my lord You know your father's temper : at this time He will allow no speech which I do guess You do not purpose to him and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet I fear : Then till the fury of his highness settle Come not before him <eos> FLORIZEL : I not purpose it <eos> I think Camillo <eos> CAMILLO : Even he my lord <eos> PERDITA : How often have I told you 'twould be thus <eos> How often said my dignity would last But till 'twere known <eos> FLORIZEL : It cannot fail but by The violation of my faith and then Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together And mar the seeds within <eos> Lift up thy looks : From my succession wipe me father I Am heir to my affection <eos> CAMILLO : Be advised <eos> FLORIZEL : I am and by my fancy : if my reason Will thereto be obedient I have reason If not my senses better pleased with madness Do bid it welcome <eos> CAMILLO : This is desperate sir <eos> FLORIZEL : So call it : but it does fulfil my vow I needs must think it honesty <eos> Camillo Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may Be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides In unknown fathoms will I break my oath To this my fair beloved : therefore I pray you As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend When he shall miss me <eos>as in faith I mean not To see him any more <eos>cast your good counsels Upon his passion let myself and fortune Tug for the time to come <eos> This you may know And so deliver I am put to sea With her whom here I cannot hold on shore And most opportune to our need I have A vessel rides fast by but not prepared For this design <eos> What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor Concern me the reporting <eos> CAMILLO : O my lord <eos> I would your spirit were easier for advice Or stronger for your need <eos> FLORIZEL : Hark Perdita I'll hear you by and by <eos> CAMILLO : He's irremoveable Resolved for flight <eos> Now were I happy if His going I could frame to serve my turn Save him from danger do him love and honour Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king my master whom I so much thirst to see <eos> FLORIZEL : Now good Camillo I am so fraught with curious business that I leave out ceremony <eos> CAMILLO : Sir I think You have heard of my poor services i' the love That I have borne your father <eos> FLORIZEL : Very nobly Have you deserved : it is my father's music To speak your deeds not little of his care To have them recompensed as thought on <eos> CAMILLO : Well my lord If you may please to think I love the king And through him what is nearest to him which is Your gracious self embrace but my direction : If your more ponderous and settled project May suffer alteration on mine honour I'll point you where you shall have such receiving As shall become your highness where you may Enjoy your mistress from the whom I see There's no disjunction to be made but by <eos> As heavens forefend <eos> <eos>your ruin marry her And with my best endeavours in your absence Your discontenting father strive to qualify And bring him up to liking <eos> FLORIZEL : How Camillo May this almost a miracle be done <eos> That I may call thee something more than man And after that trust to thee <eos> CAMILLO : Have you thought on A place whereto you'll go <eos> FLORIZEL : Not any yet : But as the unthought-on accident is guilty To what we wildly do so we profess Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies Of every wind that blows <eos> CAMILLO : Then list to me : This follows if you will not change your purpose But undergo this flight make for Sicilia And there present yourself and your fair princess For so I see she must be 'fore Leontes : She shall be habited as it becomes The partner of your bed <eos> Methinks I see Leontes opening his free arms and weeping His welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness As 'twere i' the father's person kisses the hands Of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him 'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one He chides to hell and bids the other grow Faster than thought or time <eos> FLORIZEL : Worthy Camillo What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him <eos> CAMILLO : Sent by the king your father To greet him and to give him comforts <eos> Sir The manner of your bearing towards him with What you as from your father shall deliver Things known betwixt us three I'll write you down : The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say that he shall not perceive But that you have your father's bosom there And speak his very heart <eos> FLORIZEL : I am bound to you : There is some sap in this <eos> CAMILLO : A cause more promising Than a wild dedication of yourselves To unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain To miseries enough no hope to help you But as you shake off one to take another Nothing so certain as your anchors who Do their best office if they can but stay you Where you'll be loath to be : besides you know Prosperity's the very bond of love Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together Affliction alters <eos> PERDITA : One of these is true : I think affliction may subdue the cheek But not take in the mind <eos> CAMILLO : Yea say you so <eos> There shall not at your father's house these seven years Be born another such <eos> FLORIZEL : My good Camillo She is as forward of her breeding as She is i' the rear our birth <eos> CAMILLO : I cannot say 'tis pity She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress To most that teach <eos> PERDITA : Your pardon sir for this I'll blush you thanks <eos> FLORIZEL : My prettiest Perdita <eos> But O the thorns we stand upon <eos> Camillo Preserver of my father now of me The medicine of our house how shall we do <eos> We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son Nor shall appear in Sicilia <eos> CAMILLO : My lord Fear none of this : I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there : it shall be so my care To have you royally appointed as if The scene you play were mine <eos> For instance sir That you may know you shall not want one word <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Ha ha <eos> what a fool Honesty is <eos> and Trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman <eos> I have sold all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch table-book ballad knife tape glove shoe-tie bracelet horn-ring to keep my pack from fasting : they throng who should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer : by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture and what I saw to my good use I remembered <eos> My clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears : you might have pinched a placket it was senseless 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse I could have filed keys off that hung in chains : no hearing no feeling but my sir's song and admiring the nothing of it <eos> So that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's son and scared my choughs from the chaff I had not left a purse alive in the whole army <eos> CAMILLO : Nay but my letters by this means being there So soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt <eos> FLORIZEL : And those that you'll procure from King Leontes <eos> CAMILLO : Shall satisfy your father <eos> PERDITA : Happy be you <eos> All that you speak shows fair <eos> CAMILLO : Who have we here <eos> We'll make an instrument of this omit Nothing may give us aid <eos> AUTOLYCUS : If they have overheard me now why hanging <eos> CAMILLO : How now good fellow <eos> why shakest thou so <eos> Fear not man here's no harm intended to thee <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I am a poor fellow sir <eos> CAMILLO : Why be so still here's nobody will steal that from thee : yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly <eos>thou must think there's a necessity in't <eos>and change garments with this gentleman : though the pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee there's some boot <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I am a poor fellow sir <eos> I know ye well enough <eos> CAMILLO : Nay prithee dispatch : the gentleman is half flayed already <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Are you in earnest sir <eos> I smell the trick on't <eos> FLORIZEL : Dispatch I prithee <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Indeed I have had earnest : but I cannot with conscience take it <eos> CAMILLO : Unbuckle unbuckle <eos> Fortunate mistress <eos>let my prophecy Come home to ye <eos> <eos>you must retire yourself Into some covert : take your sweetheart's hat And pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face Dismantle you and as you can disliken The truth of your own seeming that you may <eos> For I do fear eyes over <eos>to shipboard Get undescried <eos> PERDITA : I see the play so lies That I must bear a part <eos> CAMILLO : No remedy <eos> Have you done there <eos> FLORIZEL : Should I now meet my father He would not call me son <eos> CAMILLO : Nay you shall have no hat <eos> Come lady come <eos> Farewell my friend <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Adieu sir <eos> FLORIZEL : O Perdita what have we twain forgot <eos> Pray you a word <eos> CAMILLO : FLORIZEL : Fortune speed us <eos> Thus we set on Camillo to the sea-side <eos> CAMILLO : The swifter speed the better <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I understand the business I hear it : to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cut-purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses <eos> I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive <eos> What an exchange had this been without boot <eos> What a boot is here with this exchange <eos> Sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do any thing extempore <eos> The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels : if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal I would not do't : I hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am I constant to my profession <eos> Aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain : every lane's end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work <eos> Clown : See see what a man you are now <eos> There is no other way but to tell the king she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood <eos> Shepherd : Nay but hear me <eos> Clown : Nay but hear me <eos> Shepherd : Go to then <eos> Clown : She being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him <eos> Show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her : this being done let the law go whistle : I warrant you <eos> Shepherd : I will tell the king all every word yea and his son's pranks too who I may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the king's brother-in-law <eos> Clown : Indeed brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Shepherd : Well let us to the king : there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Clown : Pray heartily he be at palace <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Shepherd : To the palace an it like your worship <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and any thing that is fitting to be known discover <eos> Clown : We are but plain fellows sir <eos> AUTOLYCUS : A lie you are rough and hairy <eos> Let me have no lying : it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie : but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie <eos> Clown : Your worship had like to have given us one if you had not taken yourself with the manner <eos> Shepherd : Are you a courtier an't like you sir <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Whether it like me or no I am a courtier <eos> Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings <eos> hath not my gait in it the measure of the court <eos> receives not thy nose court-odor from me <eos> reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt <eos> Thinkest thou for that I insinuate or toaze from thee thy business I am therefore no courtier <eos> I am courtier cap-a-pe and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there : whereupon I command thee to open thy affair <eos> Shepherd : My business sir is to the king <eos> AUTOLYCUS : What advocate hast thou to him <eos> Shepherd : I know not an't like you <eos> Clown : Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant : say you have none <eos> Shepherd : None sir I have no pheasant cock nor hen <eos> AUTOLYCUS : How blessed are we that are not simple men <eos> Yet nature might have made me as these are Therefore I will not disdain <eos> Clown : This cannot be but a great courtier <eos> Shepherd : His garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely <eos> Clown : He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical : a great man I'll warrant I know by the picking on's teeth <eos> AUTOLYCUS : The fardel there <eos> what's i' the fardel <eos> Wherefore that box <eos> Shepherd : Sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king and which he shall know within this hour if I may come to the speech of him <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Age thou hast lost thy labour <eos> Shepherd : Why sir <eos> AUTOLYCUS : The king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself : for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief <eos> Shepard : So 'tis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherd's daughter <eos> AUTOLYCUS : If that shepherd be not in hand-fast let him fly : the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster <eos> Clown : Think you so sir <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman : which though it be great pity yet it is necessary <eos> An old sheep-whistling rogue a ram-tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace <eos> Some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say I draw our throne into a sheep-cote <eos> all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy <eos> Clown : Has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear <eos> an't like you sir <eos> AUTOLYCUS : He has a son who shall be flayed alive then 'nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasp's nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall be be set against a brick-wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death <eos> But what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offences being so capital <eos> Tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king : being something gently considered I'll bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is man shall do it <eos> Clown : He seems to be of great authority : close with him give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold : show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand and no more ado <eos> Remember 'stoned' and 'flayed alive <eos>' Shepherd : An't please you sir to undertake the business for us here is that gold I have : I'll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you <eos> AUTOLYCUS : After I have done what I promised <eos> Shepherd : Ay sir <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Well give me the moiety <eos> Are you a party in this business <eos> Clown : In some sort sir : but though my case be a pitiful one I hope I shall not be flayed out of it <eos> AUTOLYCUS : O that's the case of the shepherd's son : hang him he'll be made an example <eos> Clown : Comfort good comfort <eos> We must to the king and show our strange sights : he must know 'tis none of your daughter nor my sister we are gone else <eos> Sir I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed and remain as he says your pawn till it be brought you <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I will trust you <eos> Walk before toward the sea-side go on the right hand : I will but look upon the hedge and follow you <eos> Clown : We are blest in this man as I may say even blest <eos> Shepherd : Let's before as he bids us : he was provided to do us good <eos> AUTOLYCUS : If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would not suffer me : she drops booties in my mouth <eos> I am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement <eos> I will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him : if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to't <eos> To him will I present them : there may be matter in it <eos> CLEOMENES : Sir you have done enough and have perform'd A saint-like sorrow : no fault could you make Which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down More penitence than done trespass : at the last Do as the heavens have done forget your evil With them forgive yourself <eos> LEONTES : Whilst I remember Her and her virtues I cannot forget My blemishes in them and so still think of The wrong I did myself which was so much That heirless it hath made my kingdom and Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man Bred his hopes out of <eos> PAULINA : True too true my lord : If one by one you wedded all the world Or from the all that are took something good To make a perfect woman she you kill'd Would be unparallel'd <eos> LEONTES : I think so <eos> Kill'd <eos> She I kill'd <eos> I did so : but thou strikest me Sorely to say I did it is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought : now good now Say so but seldom <eos> CLEOMENES : Not at all good lady : You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit and graced Your kindness better <eos> PAULINA : You are one of those Would have him wed again <eos> DION : If you would not so You pity not the state nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name consider little What dangers by his highness' fail of issue May drop upon his kingdom and devour Incertain lookers on <eos> What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well <eos> What holier than for royalty's repair For present comfort and for future good To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to't <eos> PAULINA : There is none worthy Respecting her that's gone <eos> Besides the gods Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes For has not the divine Apollo said Is't not the tenor of his oracle That King Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found <eos> which that it shall Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave And come again to me who on my life Did perish with the infant <eos> 'Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary Oppose against their wills <eos> Care not for issue The crown will find an heir : great Alexander Left his to the worthiest so his successor Was like to be the best <eos> LEONTES : Good Paulina Who hast the memory of Hermione I know in honour O that ever I Had squared me to thy counsel <eos> then even now I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes Have taken treasure from her lips <eos> PAULINA : And left them More rich for what they yielded <eos> LEONTES : Thou speak'st truth <eos> No more such wives therefore no wife : one worse And better used would make her sainted spirit Again possess her corpse and on this stage Where we're offenders now appear soul-vex'd And begin 'Why to me <eos>' PAULINA : Had she such power She had just cause <eos> LEONTES : She had and would incense me To murder her I married <eos> PAULINA : I should so <eos> Were I the ghost that walk'd I'ld bid you mark Her eye and tell me for what dull part in't You chose her then I'ld shriek that even your ears Should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd Should be 'Remember mine <eos>' LEONTES : Stars stars And all eyes else dead coals <eos> Fear thou no wife I'll have no wife Paulina <eos> PAULINA : Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave <eos> LEONTES : Never Paulina so be blest my spirit <eos> PAULINA : Then good my lords bear witness to his oath <eos> CLEOMENES : You tempt him over-much <eos> PAULINA : Unless another As like Hermione as is her picture Affront his eye <eos> CLEOMENES : Good madam <eos> PAULINA : I have done <eos> Yet if my lord will marry <eos>if you will sir No remedy but you will <eos>give me the office To choose you a queen : she shall not be so young As was your former but she shall be such As walk'd your first queen's ghost it should take joy To see her in your arms <eos> LEONTES : My true Paulina We shall not marry till thou bid'st us <eos> PAULINA : That Shall be when your first queen's again in breath Never till then <eos> Gentleman : One that gives out himself Prince Florizel Son of Polixenes with his princess she The fairest I have yet beheld desires access To your high presence <eos> LEONTES : What with him <eos> he comes not Like to his father's greatness : his approach So out of circumstance and sudden tells us 'Tis not a visitation framed but forced By need and accident <eos> What train <eos> Gentleman : But few And those but mean <eos> LEONTES : His princess say you with him <eos> Gentleman : Ay the most peerless piece of earth I think That e'er the sun shone bright on <eos> PAULINA : O Hermione As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone so must thy grave Give way to what's seen now <eos> Sir you yourself Have said and writ so but your writing now Is colder than that theme 'She had not been Nor was not to be equall'd' <eos>thus your verse Flow'd with her beauty once : 'tis shrewdly ebb'd To say you have seen a better <eos> Gentleman : Pardon madam : The one I have almost forgot <eos>your pardon <eos> The other when she has obtain'd your eye Will have your tongue too <eos> This is a creature Would she begin a sect might quench the zeal Of all professors else make proselytes Of who she but bid follow <eos> PAULINA : How <eos> not women <eos> Gentleman : Women will love her that she is a woman More worth than any man men that she is The rarest of all women <eos> LEONTES : Go Cleomenes Yourself assisted with your honour'd friends Bring them to our embracement <eos> Still 'tis strange He thus should steal upon us <eos> PAULINA : Had our prince Jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd Well with this lord : there was not full a month Between their births <eos> LEONTES : Prithee no more cease thou know'st He dies to me again when talk'd of : sure When I shall see this gentleman thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may Unfurnish me of reason <eos> They are come <eos> Your mother was most true to wedlock prince For she did print your royal father off Conceiving you : were I but twenty-one Your father's image is so hit in you His very air that I should call you brother As I did him and speak of something wildly By us perform'd before <eos> Most dearly welcome <eos> And your fair princess <eos>goddess <eos> <eos>O alas <eos> I lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth Might thus have stood begetting wonder as You gracious couple do : and then I lost <eos> All mine own folly <eos>the society Amity too of your brave father whom Though bearing misery I desire my life Once more to look on him <eos> FLORIZEL : By his command Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him Give you all greetings that a king at friend Can send his brother : and but infirmity Which waits upon worn times hath something seized His wish'd ability he had himself The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his Measured to look upon you whom he loves <eos> He bade me say so <eos>more than all the sceptres And those that bear them living <eos> LEONTES : O my brother Good gentleman <eos> the wrongs I have done thee stir Afresh within me and these thy offices So rarely kind are as interpreters Of my behind-hand slackness <eos> Welcome hither As is the spring to the earth <eos> And hath he too Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage At least ungentle of the dreadful Neptune To greet a man not worth her pains much less The adventure of her person <eos> FLORIZEL : Good my lord She came from Libya <eos> LEONTES : Where the warlike Smalus That noble honour'd lord is fear'd and loved <eos> FLORIZEL : Most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter His tears proclaim'd his parting with her : thence A prosperous south-wind friendly we have cross'd To execute the charge my father gave me For visiting your highness : my best train I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd Who for Bohemia bend to signify Not only my success in Libya sir But my arrival and my wife's in safety Here where we are <eos> LEONTES : The blessed gods Purge all infection from our air whilst you Do climate here <eos> You have a holy father A graceful gentleman against whose person So sacred as it is I have done sin : For which the heavens taking angry note Have left me issueless and your father's blest As he from heaven merits it with you Worthy his goodness <eos> What might I have been Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on Such goodly things as you <eos> Lord : Most noble sir That which I shall report will bear no credit Were not the proof so nigh <eos> Please you great sir Bohemia greets you from himself by me Desires you to attach his son who has <eos> His dignity and duty both cast off <eos> Fled from his father from his hopes and with A shepherd's daughter <eos> LEONTES : Where's Bohemia <eos> speak <eos> Lord : Here in your city I now came from him : I speak amazedly and it becomes My marvel and my message <eos> To your court Whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems Of this fair couple meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother having both their country quitted With this young prince <eos> FLORIZEL : Camillo has betray'd me Whose honour and whose honesty till now Endured all weathers <eos> Lord : Lay't so to his charge : He's with the king your father <eos> LEONTES : Who <eos> Camillo <eos> Lord : Camillo sir I spake with him who now Has these poor men in question <eos> Never saw I Wretches so quake : they kneel they kiss the earth Forswear themselves as often as they speak : Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them With divers deaths in death <eos> PERDITA : O my poor father <eos> The heaven sets spies upon us will not have Our contract celebrated <eos> LEONTES : You are married <eos> FLORIZEL : We are not sir nor are we like to be The stars I see will kiss the valleys first : The odds for high and low's alike <eos> LEONTES : My lord Is this the daughter of a king <eos> FLORIZEL : She is When once she is my wife <eos> LEONTES : That 'once' I see by your good father's speed Will come on very slowly <eos> I am sorry Most sorry you have broken from his liking Where you were tied in duty and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty That you might well enjoy her <eos> FLORIZEL : Dear look up : Though Fortune visible an enemy Should chase us with my father power no jot Hath she to change our loves <eos> Beseech you sir Remember since you owed no more to time Than I do now : with thought of such affections Step forth mine advocate at your request My father will grant precious things as trifles <eos> LEONTES : Would he do so I'ld beg your precious mistress Which he counts but a trifle <eos> PAULINA : Sir my liege Your eye hath too much youth in't : not a month 'Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes Than what you look on now <eos> LEONTES : I thought of her Even in these looks I made <eos> But your petition Is yet unanswer'd <eos> I will to your father : Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires I am friend to them and you : upon which errand I now go toward him therefore follow me And mark what way I make : come good my lord <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Beseech you sir were you present at this relation <eos> First Gentleman : I was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it : whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I would most gladly know the issue of it <eos> First Gentleman : I make a broken delivery of the business but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration : they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed : a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be <eos> Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more <eos> The news Rogero <eos> Second Gentleman : Nothing but bonfires : the oracle is fulfilled the king's daughter is found : such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it <eos> Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward : he can deliver you more <eos> How goes it now sir <eos> this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion : has the king found his heir <eos> Third Gentleman : Most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance : that which you hear you'll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs <eos> The mantle of Queen Hermione's her jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king's daughter <eos> Did you see the meeting of the two kings <eos> Second Gentleman : No <eos> Third Gentleman : Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of <eos> There might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears <eos> There was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour <eos> Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries 'O thy mother thy mother <eos>' then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son-in-law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns <eos> I never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it <eos> Second Gentleman : What pray you became of Antigonus that carried hence the child <eos> Third Gentleman : Like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open <eos> He was torn to pieces with a bear : this avouches the shepherd's son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows <eos> First Gentleman : What became of his bark and his followers <eos> Third Gentleman : Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and in the view of the shepherd : so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found <eos> But O the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina <eos> She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled : she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing <eos> First Gentleman : The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted <eos> Third Gentleman : One of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queen's death with the manner how she came to't bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an 'Alas' I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood <eos> Who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed : if all the world could have seen 't the woe had been universal <eos> First Gentleman : Are they returned to the court <eos> Third Gentleman : No : the princess hearing of her mother's statue which is in the keeping of Paulina <eos>a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile Nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape : he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer : thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup <eos> Second Gentleman : I thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of Hermione visited that removed house <eos> Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing <eos> First Gentleman : Who would be thence that has the benefit of access <eos> every wink of an eye some new grace will be born : our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge <eos> Let's along <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Now had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head <eos> I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince : told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what : but he at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much sea-sick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered <eos> But 'tis all one to me for had I been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits <eos> Here come those I have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune <eos> Shepherd : Come boy I am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born <eos> Clown : You are well met sir <eos> You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born <eos> See you these clothes <eos> say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born : you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born : give me the lie do and try whether I am not now a gentleman born <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I know you are now sir a gentleman born <eos> Clown : Ay and have been so any time these four hours <eos> Shepherd : And so have I boy <eos> Clown : So you have : but I was a gentleman born before my father for the king's son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed <eos> Shepherd : We may live son to shed many more <eos> Clown : Ay or else 'twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master <eos> Shepherd : Prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen <eos> Clown : Thou wilt amend thy life <eos> AUTOLYCUS : Ay an it like your good worship <eos> Clown : Give me thy hand : I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia <eos> Shepherd : You may say it but not swear it <eos> Clown : Not swear it now I am a gentleman <eos> Let boors and franklins say it I'll swear it <eos> Shepherd : How if it be false son <eos> Clown : If it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend : and I'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk : but I'll swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands <eos> AUTOLYCUS : I will prove so sir to my power <eos> Clown : Ay by any means prove a tall fellow : if I do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not <eos> Hark <eos> the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the queen's picture <eos> Come follow us : we'll be thy good masters <eos> LEONTES : O grave and good Paulina the great comfort That I have had of thee <eos> PAULINA : What sovereign sir I did not well I meant well <eos> All my services You have paid home : but that you have vouchsafed With your crown'd brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit It is a surplus of your grace which never My life may last to answer <eos> LEONTES : O Paulina We honour you with trouble : but we came To see the statue of our queen : your gallery Have we pass'd through not without much content In many singularities but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon The statue of her mother <eos> PAULINA : As she lived peerless So her dead likeness I do well believe Excels whatever yet you look'd upon Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it Lonely apart <eos> But here it is : prepare To see the life as lively mock'd as ever Still sleep mock'd death : behold and say 'tis well <eos> I like your silence it the more shows off Your wonder : but yet speak first you my liege Comes it not something near <eos> LEONTES : Her natural posture <eos> Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione or rather thou art she In thy not chiding for she was as tender As infancy and grace <eos> But yet Paulina Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing So aged as this seems <eos> POLIXENES : O not by much <eos> PAULINA : So much the more our carver's excellence Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she lived now <eos> LEONTES : As now she might have done So much to my good comfort as it is Now piercing to my soul <eos> O thus she stood Even with such life of majesty warm life As now it coldly stands when first I woo'd her <eos> I am ashamed : does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it <eos> O royal piece There's magic in thy majesty which has My evils conjured to remembrance and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits Standing like stone with thee <eos> PERDITA : And give me leave And do not say 'tis superstition that I kneel and then implore her blessing <eos> Lady Dear queen that ended when I but began Give me that hand of yours to kiss <eos> PAULINA : O patience <eos> The statue is but newly fix'd the colour's Not dry <eos> CAMILLO : My lord your sorrow was too sore laid on Which sixteen winters cannot blow away So many summers dry scarce any joy Did ever so long live no sorrow But kill'd itself much sooner <eos> POLIXENES : Dear my brother Let him that was the cause of this have power To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself <eos> PAULINA : Indeed my lord If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you <eos>for the stone is mine <eos> I'ld not have show'd it <eos> LEONTES : Do not draw the curtain <eos> PAULINA : No longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy May think anon it moves <eos> LEONTES : Let be let be <eos> Would I were dead but that methinks already <eos> What was he that did make it <eos> See my lord Would you not deem it breathed <eos> and that those veins Did verily bear blood <eos> POLIXENES : Masterly done : The very life seems warm upon her lip <eos> LEONTES : The fixture of her eye has motion in't As we are mock'd with art <eos> PAULINA : I'll draw the curtain : My lord's almost so far transported that He'll think anon it lives <eos> LEONTES : O sweet Paulina Make me to think so twenty years together <eos> No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness <eos> Let 't alone <eos> PAULINA : I am sorry sir I have thus far stirr'd you : but I could afflict you farther <eos> LEONTES : Do Paulina For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort <eos> Still methinks There is an air comes from her : what fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath <eos> Let no man mock me For I will kiss her <eos> PAULINA : Good my lord forbear : The ruddiness upon her lip is wet You'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own With oily painting <eos> Shall I draw the curtain <eos> LEONTES : No not these twenty years <eos> PERDITA : So long could I Stand by a looker on <eos> PAULINA : Either forbear Quit presently the chapel or resolve you For more amazement <eos> If you can behold it I'll make the statue move indeed descend And take you by the hand but then you'll think <eos> Which I protest against <eos>I am assisted By wicked powers <eos> LEONTES : What you can make her do I am content to look on : what to speak I am content to hear for 'tis as easy To make her speak as move <eos> PAULINA : It is required You do awake your faith <eos> Then all stand still On : those that think it is unlawful business I am about let them depart <eos> LEONTES : Proceed : No foot shall stir <eos> PAULINA : Music awake her strike <eos> 'Tis time descend be stone no more approach Strike all that look upon with marvel <eos> Come I'll fill your grave up : stir nay come away Bequeath to death your numbness for from him Dear life redeems you <eos> You perceive she stirs : Start not her actions shall be holy as You hear my spell is lawful : do not shun her Until you see her die again for then You kill her double <eos> Nay present your hand : When she was young you woo'd her now in age Is she become the suitor <eos> LEONTES : O she's warm <eos> If this be magic let it be an art Lawful as eating <eos> POLIXENES : She embraces him <eos> CAMILLO : She hangs about his neck : If she pertain to life let her speak too <eos> POLIXENES : Ay and make't manifest where she has lived Or how stolen from the dead <eos> PAULINA : That she is living Were it but told you should be hooted at Like an old tale : but it appears she lives Though yet she speak not <eos> Mark a little while <eos> Please you to interpose fair madam : kneel And pray your mother's blessing <eos> Turn good lady Our Perdita is found <eos> HERMIONE : You gods look down And from your sacred vials pour your graces Upon my daughter's head <eos> Tell me mine own <eos> Where hast thou been preserved <eos> where lived <eos> how found Thy father's court <eos> for thou shalt hear that I Knowing by Paulina that the oracle Gave hope thou wast in being have preserved Myself to see the issue <eos> PAULINA : There's time enough for that Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like relation <eos> Go together You precious winners all your exultation Partake to every one <eos> I an old turtle Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there My mate that's never to be found again Lament till I am lost <eos> LEONTES : O peace Paulina <eos> Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent As I by thine a wife : this is a match And made between's by vows <eos> Thou hast found mine But how is to be question'd for I saw her As I thought dead and have in vain said many A prayer upon her grave <eos> I'll not seek far <eos> For him I partly know his mind <eos>to find thee An honourable husband <eos> Come Camillo And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty Is richly noted and here justified By us a pair of kings <eos> Let's from this place <eos> What <eos> look upon my brother : both your pardons That e'er I put between your holy looks My ill suspicion <eos> This is your son-in-law And son unto the king who heavens directing Is troth-plight to your daughter <eos> Good Paulina Lead us from hence where we may leisurely Each one demand an answer to his part Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first We were dissever'd : hastily lead away <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Escalus <eos> ESCALUS : My lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Of government the properties to unfold Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse Since I am put to know that your own science Exceeds in that the lists of all advice My strength can give you : then no more remains But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able And let them work <eos> The nature of our people Our city's institutions and the terms For common justice you're as pregnant in As art and practise hath enriched any That we remember <eos> There is our commission From which we would not have you warp <eos> Call hither I say bid come before us Angelo <eos> What figure of us think you he will bear <eos> For you must know we have with special soul Elected him our absence to supply Lent him our terror dress'd him with our love And given his deputation all the organs Of our own power : what think you of it <eos> ESCALUS : If any in Vienna be of worth To undergo such ample grace and honour It is Lord Angelo <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Look where he comes <eos> ANGELO : Always obedient to your grace's will I come to know your pleasure <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Angelo There is a kind of character in thy life That to the observer doth thy history Fully unfold <eos> Thyself and thy belongings Are not thine own so proper as to waste Thyself upon thy virtues they on thee <eos> Heaven doth with us as we with torches do Not light them for themselves for if our virtues Did not go forth of us 'twere all alike As if we had them not <eos> Spirits are not finely touch'd But to fine issues nor Nature never lends The smallest scruple of her excellence But like a thrifty goddess she determines Herself the glory of a creditor Both thanks and use <eos> But I do bend my speech To one that can my part in him advertise Hold therefore Angelo : <eos> In our remove be thou at full ourself Mortality and mercy in Vienna Live in thy tongue and heart : old Escalus Though first in question is thy secondary <eos> Take thy commission <eos> ANGELO : Now good my lord Let there be some more test made of my metal Before so noble and so great a figure Be stamp'd upon it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : No more evasion : We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice Proceeded to you therefore take your honours <eos> Our haste from hence is of so quick condition That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd Matters of needful value <eos> We shall write to you As time and our concernings shall importune How it goes with us and do look to know What doth befall you here <eos> So fare you well To the hopeful execution do I leave you Of your commissions <eos> ANGELO : Yet give leave my lord That we may bring you something on the way <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : My haste may not admit it Nor need you on mine honour have to do With any scruple your scope is as mine own So to enforce or qualify the laws As to your soul seems good <eos> Give me your hand : I'll privily away <eos> I love the people But do not like to stage me to their eyes : Through it do well I do not relish well Their loud applause and Aves vehement Nor do I think the man of safe discretion That does affect it <eos> Once more fare you well <eos> ANGELO : The heavens give safety to your purposes <eos> ESCALUS : Lead forth and bring you back in happiness <eos> DUKE : I thank you <eos> Fare you well <eos> ESCALUS : I shall desire you sir to give me leave To have free speech with you and it concerns me To look into the bottom of my place : A power I have but of what strength and nature I am not yet instructed <eos> ANGELO : 'Tis so with me <eos> Let us withdraw together And we may soon our satisfaction have Touching that point <eos> ESCALUS : I'll wait upon your honour <eos> LUCIO : If the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king <eos> First Gentleman : Heaven grant us its peace but not the King of Hungary's <eos> Second Gentleman : Amen <eos> LUCIO : Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the Ten Commandments but scraped one out of the table <eos> Second Gentleman : 'Thou shalt not steal' <eos> LUCIO : Ay that he razed <eos> First Gentleman : Why 'twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions : they put forth to steal <eos> There's not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace <eos> Second Gentleman : I never heard any soldier dislike it <eos> LUCIO : I believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was said <eos> Second Gentleman : No <eos> a dozen times at least <eos> First Gentleman : What in metre <eos> LUCIO : In any proportion or in any language <eos> First Gentleman : I think or in any religion <eos> LUCIO : Ay why not <eos> Grace is grace despite of all controversy : as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace <eos> First Gentleman : Well there went but a pair of shears between us <eos> LUCIO : I grant as there may between the lists and the velvet <eos> Thou art the list <eos> First Gentleman : And thou the velvet : thou art good velvet thou'rt a three-piled piece I warrant thee : I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a French velvet <eos> Do I speak feelingly now <eos> LUCIO : I think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech : I will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst I live forget to drink after thee <eos> First Gentleman : I think I have done myself wrong have I not <eos> Second Gentleman : Yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free <eos> LUCIO : Behold behold <eos> where Madam Mitigation comes <eos> I have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to <eos> Second Gentleman : To what I pray <eos> LUCIO : Judge <eos> Second Gentleman : To three thousand dolours a year <eos> First Gentleman : Ay and more <eos> LUCIO : A French crown more <eos> First Gentleman : Thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error I am sound <eos> LUCIO : Nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow : thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee <eos> First Gentleman : How now <eos> which of your hips has the most profound sciatica <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : Well well there's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all <eos> Second Gentleman : Who's that I pray thee <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : Marry sir that's Claudio Signior Claudio <eos> First Gentleman : Claudio to prison <eos> 'tis not so <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : Nay but I know 'tis so : I saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopped off <eos> LUCIO : But after all this fooling I would not have it so <eos> Art thou sure of this <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : I am too sure of it : and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child <eos> LUCIO : Believe me this may be : he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise-keeping <eos> Second Gentleman : Besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose <eos> First Gentleman : But most of all agreeing with the proclamation <eos> LUCIO : Away <eos> let's go learn the truth of it <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : Thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty I am custom-shrunk <eos> How now <eos> what's the news with you <eos> POMPEY : Yonder man is carried to prison <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : Well what has he done <eos> POMPEY : A woman <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : But what's his offence <eos> POMPEY : Groping for trouts in a peculiar river <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : What is there a maid with child by him <eos> POMPEY : No but there's a woman with maid by him <eos> You have not heard of the proclamation have you <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : What proclamation man <eos> POMPEY : All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : And what shall become of those in the city <eos> POMPEY : They shall stand for seed : they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down <eos> POMPEY : To the ground mistress <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : Why here's a change indeed in the commonwealth <eos> What shall become of me <eos> POMPEY : Come fear you not : good counsellors lack no clients : though you change your place you need not change your trade I'll be your tapster still <eos> Courage <eos> there will be pity taken on you : you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : What's to do here Thomas tapster <eos> let's withdraw <eos> POMPEY : Here comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to prison and there's Madam Juliet <eos> CLAUDIO : Fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world <eos> Bear me to prison where I am committed <eos> Provost : I do it not in evil disposition But from Lord Angelo by special charge <eos> CLAUDIO : Thus can the demigod Authority Make us pay down for our offence by weight The words of heaven on whom it will it will On whom it will not so yet still 'tis just <eos> LUCIO : Why how now Claudio <eos> whence comes this restraint <eos> CLAUDIO : From too much liberty my Lucio liberty : As surfeit is the father of much fast So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint <eos> Our natures do pursue Like rats that ravin down their proper bane A thirsty evil and when we drink we die <eos> LUCIO : If could speak so wisely under an arrest I would send for certain of my creditors : and yet to say the truth I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment <eos> What's thy offence Claudio <eos> CLAUDIO : What but to speak of would offend again <eos> LUCIO : What is't murder <eos> CLAUDIO : No <eos> LUCIO : Lechery <eos> CLAUDIO : Call it so <eos> Provost : Away sir <eos> you must go <eos> CLAUDIO : One word good friend <eos> Lucio a word with you <eos> LUCIO : A hundred if they'll do you any good <eos> Is lechery so look'd after <eos> CLAUDIO : Thus stands it with me : upon a true contract I got possession of Julietta's bed : You know the lady she is fast my wife Save that we do the denunciation lack Of outward order : this we came not to Only for propagation of a dower Remaining in the coffer of her friends From whom we thought it meet to hide our love Till time had made them for us <eos> But it chances The stealth of our most mutual entertainment With character too gross is writ on Juliet <eos> LUCIO : With child perhaps <eos> CLAUDIO : Unhappily even so <eos> And the new deputy now for the duke <eos> Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness Or whether that the body public be A horse whereon the governor doth ride Who newly in the seat that it may know He can command lets it straight feel the spur Whether the tyranny be in his place Or in his emmence that fills it up I stagger in : <eos>but this new governor Awakes me all the enrolled penalties Which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round And none of them been worn and for a name Now puts the drowsy and neglected act Freshly on me : 'tis surely for a name <eos> LUCIO : I warrant it is : and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off <eos> Send after the duke and appeal to him <eos> CLAUDIO : I have done so but he's not to be found <eos> I prithee Lucio do me this kind service : This day my sister should the cloister enter And there receive her approbation : Acquaint her with the danger of my state : Implore her in my voice that she make friends To the strict deputy bid herself assay him : I have great hope in that for in her youth There is a prone and speechless dialect Such as move men beside she hath prosperous art When she will play with reason and discourse And well she can persuade <eos> LUCIO : I pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack <eos> I'll to her <eos> CLAUDIO : I thank you good friend Lucio <eos> LUCIO : Within two hours <eos> CLAUDIO : Come officer away <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : No holy father throw away that thought Believe not that the dribbling dart of love Can pierce a complete bosom <eos> Why I desire thee To give me secret harbour hath a purpose More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends Of burning youth <eos> FRIAR THOMAS : May your grace speak of it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : My holy sir none better knows than you How I have ever loved the life removed And held in idle price to haunt assemblies Where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps <eos> I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo A man of stricture and firm abstinence My absolute power and place here in Vienna And he supposes me travell'd to Poland For so I have strew'd it in the common ear And so it is received <eos> Now pious sir You will demand of me why I do this <eos> FRIAR THOMAS : Gladly my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : We have strict statutes and most biting laws <eos> The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds Which for this nineteen years we have let slip Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave That goes not out to prey <eos> Now as fond fathers Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch Only to stick it in their children's sight For terror not to use in time the rod Becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees Dead to infliction to themselves are dead And liberty plucks justice by the nose The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart Goes all decorum <eos> FRIAR THOMAS : It rested in your grace To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased : And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd Than in Lord Angelo <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I do fear too dreadful : Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope 'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them For what I bid them do : for we bid this be done When evil deeds have their permissive pass And not the punishment <eos> Therefore indeed my father I have on Angelo imposed the office Who may in the ambush of my name strike home And yet my nature never in the fight To do in slander <eos> And to behold his sway I will as 'twere a brother of your order Visit both prince and people : therefore I prithee Supply me with the habit and instruct me How I may formally in person bear me Like a true friar <eos> More reasons for this action At our more leisure shall I render you Only this one : Lord Angelo is precise Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses That his blood flows or that his appetite Is more to bread than stone : hence shall we see If power change purpose what our seemers be <eos> ISABELLA : And have you nuns no farther privileges <eos> FRANCISCA : Are not these large enough <eos> ISABELLA : Yes truly I speak not as desiring more But rather wishing a more strict restraint Upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare <eos> LUCIO : ISABELLA : Who's that which calls <eos> FRANCISCA : It is a man's voice <eos> Gentle Isabella Turn you the key and know his business of him You may I may not you are yet unsworn <eos> When you have vow'd you must not speak with men But in the presence of the prioress : Then if you speak you must not show your face Or if you show your face you must not speak <eos> He calls again I pray you answer him <eos> ISABELLA : Peace and prosperity <eos> Who is't that calls LUCIO : Hail virgin if you be as those cheek-roses Proclaim you are no less <eos> Can you so stead me As bring me to the sight of Isabella A novice of this place and the fair sister To her unhappy brother Claudio <eos> ISABELLA : Why 'her unhappy brother' <eos> let me ask The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella and his sister <eos> LUCIO : Gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you : Not to be weary with you he's in prison <eos> ISABELLA : Woe me <eos> for what <eos> LUCIO : For that which if myself might be his judge He should receive his punishment in thanks : He hath got his friend with child <eos> ISABELLA : Sir make me not your story <eos> LUCIO : It is true <eos> I would not <eos>though 'tis my familiar sin With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest Tongue far from heart <eos>play with all virgins so : I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted <eos> By your renouncement an immortal spirit And to be talk'd with in sincerity As with a saint <eos> ISABELLA : You do blaspheme the good in mocking me <eos> LUCIO : Do not believe it <eos> Fewness and truth 'tis thus : Your brother and his lover have embraced : As those that feed grow full as blossoming time That from the seedness the bare fallow brings To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry <eos> ISABELLA : Some one with child by him <eos> My cousin Juliet <eos> LUCIO : Is she your cousin <eos> ISABELLA : Adoptedly as school-maids change their names By vain though apt affection <eos> LUCIO : She it is <eos> ISABELLA : O let him marry her <eos> LUCIO : This is the point <eos> The duke is very strangely gone from hence Bore many gentlemen myself being one In hand and hope of action : but we do learn By those that know the very nerves of state His givings-out were of an infinite distance From his true-meant design <eos> Upon his place And with full line of his authority Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood Is very snow-broth one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind study and fast <eos> He <eos>to give fear to use and liberty Which have for long run by the hideous law As mice by lions <eos>hath pick'd out an act Under whose heavy sense your brother's life Falls into forfeit : he arrests him on it And follows close the rigour of the statute To make him an example <eos> All hope is gone Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo : and that's my pith of business 'Twixt you and your poor brother <eos> ISABELLA : Doth he so seek his life <eos> LUCIO : Has censured him Already and as I hear the provost hath A warrant for his execution <eos> ISABELLA : Alas <eos> what poor ability's in me To do him good <eos> LUCIO : Assay the power you have <eos> ISABELLA : My power <eos> Alas I doubt <eos> LUCIO : Our doubts are traitors And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt <eos> Go to Lord Angelo And let him learn to know when maidens sue Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe them <eos> ISABELLA : I'll see what I can do <eos> LUCIO : But speedily <eos> ISABELLA : I will about it straight No longer staying but to give the mother Notice of my affair <eos> I humbly thank you : Commend me to my brother : soon at night I'll send him certain word of my success <eos> LUCIO : I take my leave of you <eos> ISABELLA : Good sir adieu <eos> ANGELO : We must not make a scarecrow of the law Setting it up to fear the birds of prey And let it keep one shape till custom make it Their perch and not their terror <eos> ESCALUS : Ay but yet Let us be keen and rather cut a little Than fall and bruise to death <eos> Alas this gentleman Whom I would save had a most noble father <eos> Let but your honour know Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue That in the working of your own affections Had time cohered with place or place with wishing Or that the resolute acting of your blood Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose Whether you had not sometime in your life Err'd in this point which now you censure him And pull'd the law upon you <eos> ANGELO : 'Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus Another thing to fall <eos> I not deny The jury passing on the prisoner's life May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try <eos> What's open made to justice That justice seizes : what know the laws That thieves do pass on thieves <eos> 'Tis very pregnant The jewel that we find we stoop and take't Because we see it but what we do not see We tread upon and never think of it <eos> You may not so extenuate his offence For I have had such faults but rather tell me When I that censure him do so offend Let mine own judgment pattern out my death And nothing come in partial <eos> Sir he must die <eos> ESCALUS : Be it as your wisdom will <eos> ANGELO : Where is the provost <eos> Provost : Here if it like your honour <eos> ANGELO : See that Claudio Be executed by nine to-morrow morning : Bring him his confessor let him be prepared For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage <eos> ESCALUS : ELBOW : Come bring them away : if these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses I know no law : bring them away <eos> ANGELO : How now sir <eos> What's your name <eos> and what's the matter <eos> ELBOW : If it Please your honour I am the poor duke's constable and my name is Elbow : I do lean upon justice sir and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors <eos> ANGELO : Benefactors <eos> Well what benefactors are they <eos> are they not malefactors <eos> ELBOW : If it <eos> please your honour I know not well what they are : but precise villains they are that I am sure of and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have <eos> ESCALUS : This comes off well here's a wise officer <eos> ANGELO : Go to : what quality are they of <eos> Elbow is your name <eos> why dost thou not speak Elbow <eos> POMPEY : He cannot sir he's out at elbow <eos> ANGELO : What are you sir <eos> ELBOW : He sir <eos> a tapster sir parcel-bawd one that serves a bad woman whose house sir was as they say plucked down in the suburbs and now she professes a hot-house which I think is a very ill house too <eos> ESCALUS : How know you that <eos> ELBOW : My wife sir whom I detest before heaven and your honour <eos> ESCALUS : How <eos> thy wife <eos> ELBOW : Ay sir whom I thank heaven is an honest woman <eos> ESCALUS : Dost thou detest her therefore <eos> ELBOW : I say sir I will detest myself also as well as she that this house if it be not a bawd's house it is pity of her life for it is a naughty house <eos> ESCALUS : How dost thou know that constable <eos> ELBOW : Marry sir by my wife who if she had been a woman cardinally given might have been accused in fornication adultery and all uncleanliness there <eos> ESCALUS : By the woman's means <eos> ELBOW : Ay sir by Mistress Overdone's means : but as she spit in his face so she defied him <eos> POMPEY : Sir if it please your honour this is not so <eos> ELBOW : Prove it before these varlets here thou honourable man prove it <eos> ESCALUS : Do you hear how he misplaces <eos> POMPEY : Sir she came in great with child and longing saving your honour's reverence for stewed prunes sir we had but two in the house which at that very distant time stood as it were in a fruit-dish a dish of some three-pence your honours have seen such dishes they are not China dishes but very good dishes <eos> ESCALUS : Go to go to : no matter for the dish sir <eos> POMPEY : No indeed sir not of a pin you are therein in the right : but to the point <eos> As I say this Mistress Elbow being as I say with child and being great-bellied and longing as I said for prunes and having but two in the dish as I said Master Froth here this very man having eaten the rest as I said and as I say paying for them very honestly for as you know Master Froth I could not give you three-pence again <eos> FROTH : No indeed <eos> POMPEY : Very well : you being then if you be remembered cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes <eos> FROTH : Ay so I did indeed <eos> POMPEY : Why very well I telling you then if you be remembered that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of unless they kept very good diet as I told you <eos> FROTH : All this is true <eos> POMPEY : Why very well then <eos> ESCALUS : Come you are a tedious fool : to the purpose <eos> What was done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of <eos> Come me to what was done to her <eos> POMPEY : Sir your honour cannot come to that yet <eos> ESCALUS : No sir nor I mean it not <eos> POMPEY : Sir but you shall come to it by your honour's leave <eos> And I beseech you look into Master Froth here sir a man of four-score pound a year whose father died at Hallowmas : was't not at Hallowmas Master Froth <eos> FROTH : All-hallond eve <eos> POMPEY : Why very well I hope here be truths <eos> He sir sitting as I say in a lower chair sir 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes where indeed you have a delight to sit have you not <eos> FROTH : I have so because it is an open room and good for winter <eos> POMPEY : Why very well then I hope here be truths <eos> ANGELO : This will last out a night in Russia When nights are longest there : I'll take my leave <eos> And leave you to the hearing of the cause Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all <eos> ESCALUS : I think no less <eos> Good morrow to your lordship <eos> Now sir come on : what was done to Elbow's wife once more <eos> POMPEY : Once sir <eos> there was nothing done to her once <eos> ELBOW : I beseech you sir ask him what this man did to my wife <eos> POMPEY : I beseech your honour ask me <eos> ESCALUS : Well sir what did this gentleman to her <eos> POMPEY : I beseech you sir look in this gentleman's face <eos> Good Master Froth look upon his honour 'tis for a good purpose <eos> Doth your honour mark his face <eos> ESCALUS : Ay sir very well <eos> POMPEY : Nay I beseech you mark it well <eos> ESCALUS : Well I do so <eos> POMPEY : Doth your honour see any harm in his face <eos> ESCALUS : Why no <eos> POMPEY : I'll be supposed upon a book his face is the worst thing about him <eos> Good then if his face be the worst thing about him how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm <eos> I would know that of your honour <eos> ESCALUS : He's in the right <eos> Constable what say you to it <eos> ELBOW : First an it like you the house is a respected house next this is a respected fellow and his mistress is a respected woman <eos> POMPEY : By this hand sir his wife is a more respected person than any of us all <eos> ELBOW : Varlet thou liest thou liest wicked varlet <eos> the time has yet to come that she was ever respected with man woman or child <eos> POMPEY : Sir she was respected with him before he married with her <eos> ESCALUS : Which is the wiser here <eos> Justice or Iniquity <eos> Is this true <eos> ELBOW : O thou caitiff <eos> O thou varlet <eos> O thou wicked Hannibal <eos> I respected with her before I was married to her <eos> If ever I was respected with her or she with me let not your worship think me the poor duke's officer <eos> Prove this thou wicked Hannibal or I'll have mine action of battery on thee <eos> ESCALUS : If he took you a box o' the ear you might have your action of slander too <eos> ELBOW : Marry I thank your good worship for it <eos> What is't your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff <eos> ESCALUS : Truly officer because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst let him continue in his courses till thou knowest what they are <eos> ELBOW : Marry I thank your worship for it <eos> Thou seest thou wicked varlet now what's come upon thee : thou art to continue now thou varlet thou art to continue <eos> ESCALUS : Where were you born friend <eos> FROTH : Here in Vienna sir <eos> ESCALUS : Are you of fourscore pounds a year <eos> FROTH : Yes an't please you sir <eos> ESCALUS : So <eos> What trade are you of sir <eos> POMPHEY : Tapster a poor widow's tapster <eos> ESCALUS : Your mistress' name <eos> POMPHEY : Mistress Overdone <eos> ESCALUS : Hath she had any more than one husband <eos> POMPEY : Nine sir Overdone by the last <eos> ESCALUS : Nine <eos> Come hither to me Master Froth <eos> Master Froth I would not have you acquainted with tapsters : they will draw you Master Froth and you will hang them <eos> Get you gone and let me hear no more of you <eos> FROTH : I thank your worship <eos> For mine own part I never come into any room in a tap-house but I am drawn in <eos> ESCALUS : Well no more of it Master Froth : farewell <eos> Come you hither to me Master tapster <eos> What's your name Master tapster <eos> POMPEY : Pompey <eos> ESCALUS : What else <eos> POMPEY : Bum sir <eos> ESCALUS : Troth and your bum is the greatest thing about you so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the Great <eos> Pompey you are partly a bawd Pompey howsoever you colour it in being a tapster are you not <eos> come tell me true : it shall be the better for you <eos> POMPEY : Truly sir I am a poor fellow that would live <eos> ESCALUS : How would you live Pompey <eos> by being a bawd <eos> What do you think of the trade Pompey <eos> is it a lawful trade <eos> POMPEY : If the law would allow it sir <eos> ESCALUS : But the law will not allow it Pompey nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna <eos> POMPEY : Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city <eos> ESCALUS : No Pompey <eos> POMPEY : Truly sir in my poor opinion they will to't then <eos> If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves you need not to fear the bawds <eos> ESCALUS : There are pretty orders beginning I can tell you : it is but heading and hanging <eos> POMPEY : If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together you'll be glad to give out a commission for more heads : if this law hold in Vienna ten year I'll rent the fairest house in it after three-pence a bay : if you live to see this come to pass say Pompey told you so <eos> ESCALUS : Thank you good Pompey and in requital of your prophecy hark you : I advise you let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever no not for dwelling where you do : if I do Pompey I shall beat you to your tent and prove a shrewd Caesar to you in plain dealing Pompey I shall have you whipt : so for this time Pompey fare you well <eos> POMPEY : I thank your worship for your good counsel : but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine <eos> Whip me <eos> No no let carman whip his jade : The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade <eos> ESCALUS : Come hither to me Master Elbow come hither Master constable <eos> How long have you been in this place of constable <eos> ELBOW : Seven year and a half sir <eos> ESCALUS : I thought by your readiness in the office you had continued in it some time <eos> You say seven years together <eos> ELBOW : And a half sir <eos> ESCALUS : Alas it hath been great pains to you <eos> They do you wrong to put you so oft upon 't : are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it <eos> ELBOW : Faith sir few of any wit in such matters : as they are chosen they are glad to choose me for them I do it for some piece of money and go through with all <eos> ESCALUS : Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven the most sufficient of your parish <eos> ELBOW : To your worship's house sir <eos> ESCALUS : To my house <eos> Fare you well <eos> What's o'clock think you <eos> Justice : Eleven sir <eos> ESCALUS : I pray you home to dinner with me <eos> Justice : I humbly thank you <eos> ESCALUS : It grieves me for the death of Claudio But there's no remedy <eos> Justice : Lord Angelo is severe <eos> ESCALUS : It is but needful : Mercy is not itself that oft looks so Pardon is still the nurse of second woe : But yet <eos>poor Claudio <eos> There is no remedy <eos> Come sir <eos> Servant : He's hearing of a cause he will come straight I'll tell him of you <eos> Provost : Pray you do <eos> I'll know His pleasure may be he will relent <eos> Alas He hath but as offended in a dream <eos> All sects all ages smack of this vice and he To die for't <eos> ANGELO : Now what's the matter <eos> Provost <eos> Provost : Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow <eos> ANGELO : Did not I tell thee yea <eos> hadst thou not order <eos> Why dost thou ask again <eos> Provost : Lest I might be too rash : Under your good correction I have seen When after execution judgment hath Repented o'er his doom <eos> ANGELO : Go to let that be mine : Do you your office or give up your place And you shall well be spared <eos> Provost : I crave your honour's pardon <eos> What shall be done sir with the groaning Juliet <eos> She's very near her hour <eos> ANGELO : Dispose of her To some more fitter place and that with speed <eos> Servant : Here is the sister of the man condemn'd Desires access to you <eos> ANGELO : Hath he a sister <eos> Provost : Ay my good lord a very virtuous maid And to be shortly of a sisterhood If not already <eos> ANGELO : Well let her be admitted <eos> See you the fornicatress be removed : Let have needful but not lavish means There shall be order for't <eos> Provost : God save your honour <eos> ANGELO : Stay a little while <eos> You're welcome : what's your will <eos> ISABELLA : I am a woeful suitor to your honour Please but your honour hear me <eos> ANGELO : Well what's your suit <eos> ISABELLA : There is a vice that most I do abhor And most desire should meet the blow of justice For which I would not plead but that I must For which I must not plead but that I am At war 'twixt will and will not <eos> ANGELO : Well the matter <eos> ISABELLA : I have a brother is condemn'd to die : I do beseech you let it be his fault And not my brother <eos> Provost : ANGELO : Condemn the fault and not the actor of it <eos> Why every fault's condemn'd ere it be done : Mine were the very cipher of a function To fine the faults whose fine stands in record And let go by the actor <eos> ISABELLA : O just but severe law <eos> I had a brother then <eos> Heaven keep your honour <eos> LUCIO : ISABELLA : Must he needs die <eos> ANGELO : Maiden no remedy <eos> ISABELLA : Yes I do think that you might pardon him And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy <eos> ANGELO : I will not do't <eos> ISABELLA : But can you if you would <eos> ANGELO : Look what I will not that I cannot do <eos> ISABELLA : But might you do't and do the world no wrong If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse As mine is to him <eos> ANGELO : He's sentenced 'tis too late <eos> LUCIO : ISABELLA : Too late <eos> why no I that do speak a word <eos> May call it back again <eos> Well believe this No ceremony that to great ones 'longs Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe Become them with one half so good a grace As mercy does <eos> If he had been as you and you as he You would have slipt like him but he like you Would not have been so stern <eos> ANGELO : Pray you be gone <eos> ISABELLA : I would to heaven I had your potency And you were Isabel <eos> should it then be thus <eos> No I would tell what 'twere to be a judge And what a prisoner <eos> LUCIO : ANGELO : Your brother is a forfeit of the law And you but waste your words <eos> ISABELLA : Alas alas <eos> Why all the souls that were were forfeit once And He that might the vantage best have took Found out the remedy <eos> How would you be If He which is the top of judgment should But judge you as you are <eos> O think on that And mercy then will breathe within your lips Like man new made <eos> ANGELO : Be you content fair maid It is the law not I condemn your brother : Were he my kinsman brother or my son It should be thus with him : he must die tomorrow <eos> ISABELLA : To-morrow <eos> O that's sudden <eos> Spare him spare him <eos> He's not prepared for death <eos> Even for our kitchens We kill the fowl of season : shall we serve heaven With less respect than we do minister To our gross selves <eos> Good good my lord bethink you Who is it that hath died for this offence <eos> There's many have committed it <eos> LUCIO : ANGELO : The law hath not been dead though it hath slept : Those many had not dared to do that evil If the first that did the edict infringe Had answer'd for his deed : now 'tis awake Takes note of what is done and like a prophet Looks in a glass that shows what future evils Either new or by remissness new-conceived And so in progress to be hatch'd and born Are now to have no successive degrees But ere they live to end <eos> ISABELLA : Yet show some pity <eos> ANGELO : I show it most of all when I show justice For then I pity those I do not know Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall And do him right that answering one foul wrong Lives not to act another <eos> Be satisfied Your brother dies to-morrow be content <eos> ISABELLA : So you must be the first that gives this sentence And he that suffer's <eos> O it is excellent To have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant <eos> LUCIO : ISABELLA : Could great men thunder As Jove himself does Jove would ne'er be quiet For every pelting petty officer Would use his heaven for thunder Nothing but thunder <eos> Merciful Heaven Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak Than the soft myrtle : but man proud man Drest in a little brief authority Most ignorant of what he's most assured His glassy essence like an angry ape Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As make the angels weep who with our spleens Would all themselves laugh mortal <eos> LUCIO : Provost : ISABELLA : We cannot weigh our brother with ourself : Great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them But in the less foul profanation <eos> LUCIO : Thou'rt i' the right girl more o that <eos> ISABELLA : That in the captain's but a choleric word Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy <eos> LUCIO : ANGELO : Why do you put these sayings upon me <eos> ISABELLA : Because authority though it err like others Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself That skins the vice o' the top <eos> Go to your bosom Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know That's like my brother's fault : if it confess A natural guiltiness such as is his Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue Against my brother's life <eos> ANGELO : ISABELLA : Gentle my lord turn back <eos> ANGELO : I will bethink me : come again tomorrow <eos> ISABELLA : Hark how I'll bribe you : good my lord turn back <eos> ANGELO : How <eos> bribe me <eos> ISABELLA : Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you <eos> LUCIO : ISABELLA : Not with fond shekels of the tested gold Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor As fancy values them but with true prayers That shall be up at heaven and enter there Ere sun-rise prayers from preserved souls From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate To nothing temporal <eos> ANGELO : Well come to me to-morrow <eos> LUCIO : ISABELLA : Heaven keep your honour safe <eos> ANGELO : ISABELLA : At what hour to-morrow Shall I attend your lordship <eos> ANGELO : At any time 'fore noon <eos> ISABELLA : 'Save your honour <eos> ANGELO : From thee even from thy virtue <eos> What's this what's this <eos> Is this her fault or mine <eos> The tempter or the tempted who sins most <eos> Ha <eos> Not she : nor doth she tempt : but it is I That lying by the violet in the sun Do as the carrion does not as the flower Corrupt with virtuous season <eos> Can it be That modesty may more betray our sense Than woman's lightness <eos> Having waste ground enough Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary And pitch our evils there <eos> O fie fie fie <eos> What dost thou or what art thou Angelo <eos> Dost thou desire her foully for those things That make her good <eos> O let her brother live <eos> Thieves for their robbery have authority When judges steal themselves <eos> What do I love her That I desire to hear her speak again And feast upon her eyes <eos> What is't I dream on <eos> O cunning enemy that to catch a saint With saints dost bait thy hook <eos> Most dangerous Is that temptation that doth goad us on To sin in loving virtue : never could the strumpet With all her double vigour art and nature Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid Subdues me quite <eos> Even till now When men were fond I smiled and wonder'd how <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Hail to you provost <eos> so I think you are <eos> Provost : I am the provost <eos> What's your will good friar <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Bound by my charity and my blest order I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison <eos> Do me the common right To let me see them and to make me know The nature of their crimes that I may minister To them accordingly <eos> Provost : I would do more than that if more were needful <eos> Look here comes one : a gentlewoman of mine Who falling in the flaws of her own youth Hath blister'd her report : she is with child And he that got it sentenced a young man More fit to do another such offence Than die for this <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : When must he die <eos> Provost : As I do think to-morrow <eos> I have provided for you : stay awhile And you shall be conducted <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Repent you fair one of the sin you carry <eos> JULIET : I do and bear the shame most patiently <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience And try your penitence if it be sound Or hollowly put on <eos> JULIET : I'll gladly learn <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Love you the man that wrong'd you <eos> JULIET : Yes as I love the woman that wrong'd him <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : So then it seems your most offenceful act Was mutually committed <eos> JULIET : Mutually <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Then was your sin of heavier kind than his <eos> JULIET : I do confess it and repent it father <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : 'Tis meet so daughter : but lest you do repent As that the sin hath brought you to this shame Which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it But as we stand in fear <eos> JULIET : I do repent me as it is an evil And take the shame with joy <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : There rest <eos> Your partner as I hear must die to-morrow And I am going with instruction to him <eos> Grace go with you Benedicite <eos> JULIET : Must die to-morrow <eos> O injurious love That respites me a life whose very comfort Is still a dying horror <eos> Provost : 'Tis pity of him <eos> ANGELO : When I would pray and think I think and pray To several subjects <eos> Heaven hath my empty words Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue Anchors on Isabel : Heaven in my mouth As if I did but only chew his name And in my heart the strong and swelling evil Of my conception <eos> The state whereon I studied Is like a good thing being often read Grown fear'd and tedious yea my gravity Wherein <eos>let no man hear me <eos>I take pride Could I with boot change for an idle plume Which the air beats for vain <eos> O place O form How often dost thou with thy case thy habit Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls To thy false seeming <eos> Blood thou art blood : Let's write good angel on the devil's horn : 'Tis not the devil's crest <eos> How now <eos> who's there <eos> Servant : One Isabel a sister desires access to you <eos> ANGELO : Teach her the way <eos> O heavens <eos> Why does my blood thus muster to my heart Making both it unable for itself And dispossessing all my other parts Of necessary fitness <eos> So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons Come all to help him and so stop the air By which he should revive : and even so The general subject to a well-wish'd king Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness Crowd to his presence where their untaught love Must needs appear offence <eos> How now fair maid <eos> ISABELLA : I am come to know your pleasure <eos> ANGELO : That you might know it would much better please me Than to demand what 'tis <eos> Your brother cannot live <eos> ISABELLA : Even so <eos> Heaven keep your honour <eos> ANGELO : Yet may he live awhile and it may be As long as you or I yet he must die <eos> ISABELLA : Under your sentence <eos> ANGELO : Yea <eos> ISABELLA : When I beseech you <eos> that in his reprieve Longer or shorter he may be so fitted That his soul sicken not <eos> ANGELO : Ha <eos> fie these filthy vices <eos> It were as good To pardon him that hath from nature stolen A man already made as to remit Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image In stamps that are forbid : 'tis all as easy Falsely to take away a life true made As to put metal in restrained means To make a false one <eos> ISABELLA : 'Tis set down so in heaven but not in earth <eos> ANGELO : Say you so <eos> then I shall pose you quickly <eos> Which had you rather that the most just law Now took your brother's life or to redeem him Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness As she that he hath stain'd <eos> ISABELLA : Sir believe this I had rather give my body than my soul <eos> ANGELO : I talk not of your soul : our compell'd sins Stand more for number than for accompt <eos> ISABELLA : How say you <eos> ANGELO : Nay I'll not warrant that for I can speak Against the thing I say <eos> Answer to this : I now the voice of the recorded law Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life : Might there not be a charity in sin To save this brother's life <eos> ISABELLA : Please you to do't I'll take it as a peril to my soul It is no sin at all but charity <eos> ANGELO : Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul Were equal poise of sin and charity <eos> ISABELLA : That I do beg his life if it be sin Heaven let me bear it <eos> you granting of my suit If that be sin I'll make it my morn prayer To have it added to the faults of mine And nothing of your answer <eos> ANGELO : Nay but hear me <eos> Your sense pursues not mine : either you are ignorant Or seem so craftily and that's not good <eos> ISABELLA : Let me be ignorant and in nothing good But graciously to know I am no better <eos> ANGELO : Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright When it doth tax itself as these black masks Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder Than beauty could display'd <eos> But mark me To be received plain I'll speak more gross : Your brother is to die <eos> ISABELLA : So <eos> ANGELO : And his offence is so as it appears Accountant to the law upon that pain <eos> ISABELLA : True <eos> ANGELO : Admit no other way to save his life <eos> As I subscribe not that nor any other But in the loss of question <eos>that you his sister Finding yourself desired of such a person Whose credit with the judge or own great place Could fetch your brother from the manacles Of the all-building law and that there were No earthly mean to save him but that either You must lay down the treasures of your body To this supposed or else to let him suffer What would you do <eos> ISABELLA : As much for my poor brother as myself : That is were I under the terms of death The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies And strip myself to death as to a bed That longing have been sick for ere I'ld yield My body up to shame <eos> ANGELO : Then must your brother die <eos> ISABELLA : And 'twere the cheaper way : Better it were a brother died at once Than that a sister by redeeming him Should die for ever <eos> ANGELO : Were not you then as cruel as the sentence That you have slander'd so <eos> ISABELLA : Ignomy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses : lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption <eos> ANGELO : You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant And rather proved the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice <eos> ISABELLA : O pardon me my lord it oft falls out To have what we would have we speak not what we mean : I something do excuse the thing I hate For his advantage that I dearly love <eos> ANGELO : We are all frail <eos> ISABELLA : Else let my brother die If not a feodary but only he Owe and succeed thy weakness <eos> ANGELO : Nay women are frail too <eos> ISABELLA : Ay as the glasses where they view themselves Which are as easy broke as they make forms <eos> Women <eos> Help Heaven <eos> men their creation mar In profiting by them <eos> Nay call us ten times frail For we are soft as our complexions are And credulous to false prints <eos> ANGELO : I think it well : And from this testimony of your own sex <eos> Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger Than faults may shake our frames <eos>let me be bold I do arrest your words <eos> Be that you are That is a woman if you be more you're none If you be one as you are well express'd By all external warrants show it now By putting on the destined livery <eos> ISABELLA : I have no tongue but one : gentle my lord Let me entreat you speak the former language <eos> ANGELO : Plainly conceive I love you <eos> ISABELLA : My brother did love Juliet And you tell me that he shall die for it <eos> ANGELO : He shall not Isabel if you give me love <eos> ISABELLA : I know your virtue hath a licence in't Which seems a little fouler than it is To pluck on others <eos> ANGELO : Believe me on mine honour My words express my purpose <eos> ISABELLA : Ha <eos> little honour to be much believed And most pernicious purpose <eos> Seeming seeming <eos> I will proclaim thee Angelo look for't : Sign me a present pardon for my brother Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud What man thou art <eos> ANGELO : Who will believe thee Isabel <eos> My unsoil'd name the austereness of my life My vouch against you and my place i' the state Will so your accusation overweigh That you shall stifle in your own report And smell of calumny <eos> I have begun And now I give my sensual race the rein : Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes That banish what they sue for redeem thy brother By yielding up thy body to my will Or else he must not only die the death But thy unkindness shall his death draw out To lingering sufferance <eos> Answer me to-morrow Or by the affection that now guides me most I'll prove a tyrant to him <eos> As for you Say what you can my false o'erweighs your true <eos> ISABELLA : To whom should I complain <eos> Did I tell this Who would believe me <eos> O perilous mouths That bear in them one and the self-same tongue Either of condemnation or approof Bidding the law make court'sy to their will : Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite To follow as it draws <eos> I'll to my brother : Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour <eos> That had he twenty heads to tender down On twenty bloody blocks he'ld yield them up Before his sister should her body stoop To such abhorr'd pollution <eos> Then Isabel live chaste and brother die : More than our brother is our chastity <eos> I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request And fit his mind to death for his soul's rest <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo <eos> CLAUDIO : The miserable have no other medicine But only hope : I've hope to live and am prepared to die <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Be absolute for death either death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter <eos> Reason thus with life : If I do lose thee I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep : a breath thou art Servile to all the skyey influences That dost this habitation where thou keep'st Hourly afflict : merely thou art death's fool For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun And yet runn'st toward him still <eos> Thou art not noble For all the accommodations that thou bear'st Are nursed by baseness <eos> Thou'rt by no means valiant For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork Of a poor worm <eos> Thy best of rest is sleep And that thou oft provokest yet grossly fear'st Thy death which is no more <eos> Thou art not thyself For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains That issue out of dust <eos> Happy thou art not For what thou hast not still thou strivest to get And what thou hast forget'st <eos> Thou art not certain For thy complexion shifts to strange effects After the moon <eos> If thou art rich thou'rt poor For like an ass whose back with ingots bows Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey And death unloads thee <eos> Friend hast thou none For thine own bowels which do call thee sire The mere effusion of thy proper loins Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum For ending thee no sooner <eos> Thou hast nor youth nor age But as it were an after-dinner's sleep Dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms Of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich Thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty To make thy riches pleasant <eos> What's yet in this That bears the name of life <eos> Yet in this life Lie hid moe thousand deaths : yet death we fear That makes these odds all even <eos> CLAUDIO : I humbly thank you <eos> To sue to live I find I seek to die And seeking death find life : let it come on <eos> ISABELLA : Provost : Who's there <eos> come in : the wish deserves a welcome <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Dear sir ere long I'll visit you again <eos> CLAUDIO : Most holy sir I thank you <eos> ISABELLA : My business is a word or two with Claudio <eos> Provost : And very welcome <eos> Look signior here's your sister <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Provost a word with you <eos> Provost : As many as you please <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Bring me to hear them speak where I may be concealed <eos> CLAUDIO : Now sister what's the comfort <eos> ISABELLA : Why As all comforts are most good most good indeed <eos> Lord Angelo having affairs to heaven Intends you for his swift ambassador Where you shall be an everlasting leiger : Therefore your best appointment make with speed To-morrow you set on <eos> CLAUDIO : Is there no remedy <eos> ISABELLA : None but such remedy as to save a head To cleave a heart in twain <eos> CLAUDIO : But is there any <eos> ISABELLA : Yes brother you may live : There is a devilish mercy in the judge If you'll implore it that will free your life But fetter you till death <eos> CLAUDIO : Perpetual durance <eos> ISABELLA : Ay just perpetual durance a restraint Though all the world's vastidity you had To a determined scope <eos> CLAUDIO : But in what nature <eos> ISABELLA : In such a one as you consenting to't Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear And leave you naked <eos> CLAUDIO : Let me know the point <eos> ISABELLA : O I do fear thee Claudio and I quake Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain And six or seven winters more respect Than a perpetual honour <eos> Darest thou die <eos> The sense of death is most in apprehension And the poor beetle that we tread upon In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great As when a giant dies <eos> CLAUDIO : Why give you me this shame <eos> Think you I can a resolution fetch From flowery tenderness <eos> If I must die I will encounter darkness as a bride And hug it in mine arms <eos> ISABELLA : There spake my brother there my father's grave Did utter forth a voice <eos> Yes thou must die : Thou art too noble to conserve a life In base appliances <eos> This outward-sainted deputy Whose settled visage and deliberate word Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew As falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil His filth within being cast he would appear A pond as deep as hell <eos> CLAUDIO : The prenzie Angelo <eos> ISABELLA : O 'tis the cunning livery of hell The damned'st body to invest and cover In prenzie guards <eos> Dost thou think Claudio <eos> If I would yield him my virginity Thou mightst be freed <eos> CLAUDIO : O heavens <eos> it cannot be <eos> ISABELLA : Yes he would give't thee from this rank offence So to offend him still <eos> This night's the time That I should do what I abhor to name Or else thou diest to-morrow <eos> CLAUDIO : Thou shalt not do't <eos> ISABELLA : O were it but my life I'ld throw it down for your deliverance As frankly as a pin <eos> CLAUDIO : Thanks dear Isabel <eos> ISABELLA : Be ready Claudio for your death tomorrow <eos> CLAUDIO : Yes <eos> Has he affections in him That thus can make him bite the law by the nose When he would force it <eos> Sure it is no sin Or of the deadly seven it is the least <eos> ISABELLA : Which is the least <eos> CLAUDIO : If it were damnable he being so wise Why would he for the momentary trick Be perdurably fined <eos> O Isabel <eos> ISABELLA : What says my brother <eos> CLAUDIO : Death is a fearful thing <eos> ISABELLA : And shamed life a hateful <eos> CLAUDIO : Ay but to die and go we know not where To lie in cold obstruction and to rot This sensible warm motion to become A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit To bathe in fiery floods or to reside In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice To be imprison'd in the viewless winds And blown with restless violence round about The pendent world or to be worse than worst Of those that lawless and incertain thought Imagine howling : 'tis too horrible <eos> The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age ache penury and imprisonment Can lay on nature is a paradise To what we fear of death <eos> ISABELLA : Alas alas <eos> CLAUDIO : Sweet sister let me live : What sin you do to save a brother's life Nature dispenses with the deed so far That it becomes a virtue <eos> ISABELLA : O you beast <eos> O faithless coward <eos> O dishonest wretch <eos> Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice <eos> Is't not a kind of incest to take life From thine own sister's shame <eos> What should I think <eos> Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair <eos> For such a warped slip of wilderness Ne'er issued from his blood <eos> Take my defiance <eos> Die perish <eos> Might but my bending down Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed : I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death No word to save thee <eos> CLAUDIO : Nay hear me Isabel <eos> ISABELLA : O fie fie fie <eos> Thy sin's not accidental but a trade <eos> Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd : 'Tis best thou diest quickly <eos> CLAUDIO : O hear me Isabella <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Vouchsafe a word young sister but one word <eos> ISABELLA : What is your will <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Might you dispense with your leisure I would by and by have some speech with you : the satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefit <eos> ISABELLA : I have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but I will attend you awhile <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Son I have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister <eos> Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures : she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive <eos> I am confessor to Angelo and I know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death : do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible : tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready <eos> CLAUDIO : Let me ask my sister pardon <eos> I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Hold you there : farewell <eos> Provost a word with you <eos> Provost : What's your will father DUKE VINCENTIO : That now you are come you will be gone <eos> Leave me awhile with the maid : my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company <eos> Provost : In good time <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good : the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair <eos> The assault that Angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling I should wonder at Angelo <eos> How will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother <eos> ISABELLA : I am now going to resolve him : I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born <eos> But O how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo <eos> If ever he return and I can speak to him I will open my lips in vain or discover his government <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : That shall not be much amiss : Yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only <eos> Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings : to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself <eos> I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business <eos> ISABELLA : Let me hear you speak farther <eos> I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Virtue is bold and goodness never fearful <eos> Have you not heard speak of Mariana the sister of Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea <eos> ISABELLA : I have heard of the lady and good words went with her name <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : She should this Angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed : between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister <eos> But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman : there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage-dowry with both her combinate husband this well-seeming Angelo <eos> ISABELLA : Can this be so <eos> did Angelo so leave her <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour : in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not <eos> ISABELLA : What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world <eos> What corruption in this life that it will let this man live <eos> But how out of this can she avail <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It is a rupture that you may easily heal : and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it <eos> ISABELLA : Show me how good father <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection : his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly <eos> Go you to Angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience <eos> This being granted in course <eos>and now follows all <eos>we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense : and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor Mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled <eos> The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt <eos> If you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof <eos> What think you of it <eos> ISABELLA : The image of it gives me content already and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It lies much in your holding up <eos> Haste you speedily to Angelo : if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction <eos> I will presently to Saint Luke's : there at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana <eos> At that place call upon me and dispatch with Angelo that it may be quickly <eos> ISABELLA : I thank you for this comfort <eos> Fare you well good father <eos> ELBOW : Nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : O heavens <eos> what stuff is here POMPEY : 'Twas never merry world since of two usuries the merriest was put down and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm and furred with fox and lamb-skins too to signify that craft being richer than innocency stands for the facing <eos> ELBOW : Come your way sir <eos> 'Bless you good father friar <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : And you good brother father <eos> What offence hath this man made you sir <eos> ELBOW : Marry sir he hath offended the law : and sir we take him to be a thief too sir for we have found upon him sir a strange picklock which we have sent to the deputy <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Fie sirrah <eos> a bawd a wicked bawd <eos> The evil that thou causest to be done That is thy means to live <eos> Do thou but think What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back From such a filthy vice : say to thyself From their abominable and beastly touches I drink I eat array myself and live <eos> Canst thou believe thy living is a life So stinkingly depending <eos> Go mend go mend <eos> POMPEY : Indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet sir I would prove <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin Thou wilt prove his <eos> Take him to prison officer : Correction and instruction must both work Ere this rude beast will profit <eos> ELBOW : He must before the deputy sir he has given him warning : the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster : if he be a whoremonger and comes before him he were as good go a mile on his errand <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : That we were all as some would seem to be From our faults as faults from seeming free <eos> ELBOW : His neck will come to your waist <eos>a cord sir <eos> POMPEY : I spy comfort I cry bail <eos> Here's a gentleman and a friend of mine <eos> LUCIO : How now noble Pompey <eos> What at the wheels of Caesar <eos> art thou led in triumph <eos> What is there none of Pygmalion's images newly made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd <eos> What reply ha <eos> What sayest thou to this tune matter and method <eos> Is't not drowned i' the last rain ha <eos> What sayest thou Trot <eos> Is the world as it was man <eos> Which is the way <eos> Is it sad and few words <eos> or how <eos> The trick of it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Still thus and thus still worse <eos> LUCIO : How doth my dear morsel thy mistress <eos> Procures she still ha <eos> POMPEY : Troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she is herself in the tub <eos> LUCIO : Why 'tis good it is the right of it it must be so : ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd : an unshunned consequence it must be so <eos> Art going to prison Pompey <eos> POMPEY : Yes faith sir <eos> LUCIO : Why 'tis not amiss Pompey <eos> Farewell : go say I sent thee thither <eos> For debt Pompey <eos> or how <eos> ELBOW : For being a bawd for being a bawd <eos> LUCIO : Well then imprison him : if imprisonment be the due of a bawd why 'tis his right : bawd is he doubtless and of antiquity too bawd-born <eos> Farewell good Pompey <eos> Commend me to the prison Pompey : you will turn good husband now Pompey you will keep the house <eos> POMPEY : I hope sir your good worship will be my bail <eos> LUCIO : No indeed will I not Pompey it is not the wear <eos> I will pray Pompey to increase your bondage : If you take it not patiently why your mettle is the more <eos> Adieu trusty Pompey <eos> 'Bless you friar <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : And you <eos> LUCIO : Does Bridget paint still Pompey ha <eos> ELBOW : Come your ways sir come <eos> POMPEY : You will not bail me then sir <eos> LUCIO : Then Pompey nor now <eos> What news abroad friar <eos> what news <eos> ELBOW : Come your ways sir come <eos> LUCIO : Go to kennel Pompey go <eos> What news friar of the duke <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I know none <eos> Can you tell me of any <eos> LUCIO : Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia other some he is in Rome : but where is he think you <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I know not where but wheresoever I wish him well <eos> LUCIO : It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to <eos> Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to 't <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : He does well in 't <eos> LUCIO : A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him : something too crabbed that way friar <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It is too general a vice and severity must cure it <eos> LUCIO : Yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied : but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down <eos> They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation : is it true think you <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : How should he be made then <eos> LUCIO : Some report a sea-maid spawned him some that he was begot between two stock-fishes <eos> But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that I know to be true : and he is a motion generative that's infallible <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You are pleasant sir and speak apace <eos> LUCIO : Why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man <eos> Would the duke that is absent have done this <eos> Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand : he had some feeling of the sport : he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way <eos> LUCIO : O sir you are deceived <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : 'Tis not possible <eos> LUCIO : Who not the duke <eos> yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish : the duke had crotchets in him <eos> He would be drunk too that let me inform you <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You do him wrong surely <eos> LUCIO : Sir I was an inward of his <eos> A shy fellow was the duke : and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : What I prithee might be the cause <eos> LUCIO : No pardon 'tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips : but this I can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Wise <eos> why no question but he was <eos> LUCIO : A very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking : the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation <eos> Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier <eos> Therefore you speak unskilfully : or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice <eos> LUCIO : Sir I know him and I love him <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love <eos> LUCIO : Come sir I know what I know <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak <eos> But if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him <eos> If it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it : I am bound to call upon you and I pray you your name <eos> LUCIO : Sir my name is Lucio well known to the duke <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : He shall know you better sir if I may live to report you <eos> LUCIO : I fear you not <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : O you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite <eos> But indeed I can do you little harm you'll forswear this again <eos> LUCIO : I'll be hanged first : thou art deceived in me friar <eos> But no more of this <eos> Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Why should he die sir <eos> LUCIO : Why <eos> For filling a bottle with a tundish <eos> I would the duke we talk of were returned again : the ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because they are lecherous <eos> The duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light : would he were returned <eos> Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing <eos> Farewell good friar : I prithee pray for me <eos> The duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on Fridays <eos> He's not past it yet and I say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic : say that I said so <eos> Farewell <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : No might nor greatness in mortality Can censure 'scape back-wounding calumny The whitest virtue strikes <eos> What king so strong Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue <eos> But who comes here <eos> ESCALUS : Go away with her to prison <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : Good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lord <eos> ESCALUS : Double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind <eos> This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant <eos> Provost : A bawd of eleven years' continuance may it please your honour <eos> MISTRESS OVERDONE : My lord this is one Lucio's information against me <eos> Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the duke's time he promised her marriage : his child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob : I have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me <eos> ESCALUS : That fellow is a fellow of much licence : let him be called before us <eos> Away with her to prison <eos> Go to no more words <eos> Provost my brother Angelo will not be altered Claudio must die to-morrow : let him be furnished with divines and have all charitable preparation <eos> if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with him <eos> Provost : So please you this friar hath been with him and advised him for the entertainment of death <eos> ESCALUS : Good even good father <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Bliss and goodness on you <eos> ESCALUS : Of whence are you <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Not of this country though my chance is now To use it for my time : I am a brother Of gracious order late come from the See In special business from his holiness <eos> ESCALUS : What news abroad i' the world <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : None but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it : novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking <eos> There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst : much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world <eos> This news is old enough yet it is every day's news <eos> I pray you sir of what disposition was the duke <eos> ESCALUS : One that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : What pleasure was he given to <eos> ESCALUS : Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice : a gentleman of all temperance <eos> But leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared <eos> I am made to understand that you have lent him visitation <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice : yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which I by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die <eos> ESCALUS : You have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling <eos> I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty : but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself <eos> ESCALUS : I am going to visit the prisoner <eos> Fare you well <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Peace be with you <eos> He who the sword of heaven will bear Should be as holy as severe Pattern in himself to know Grace to stand and virtue go More nor less to others paying Than by self-offences weighing <eos> Shame to him whose cruel striking Kills for faults of his own liking <eos> Twice treble shame on Angelo To weed my vice and let his grow <eos> O what may man within him hide Though angel on the outward side <eos> How may likeness made in crimes Making practise on the times To draw with idle spiders' strings Most ponderous and substantial things <eos> Craft against vice I must apply : With Angelo to-night shall lie His old betrothed but despised So disguise shall by the disguised Pay with falsehood false exacting And perform an old contracting <eos> MARIANA : Break off thy song and haste thee quick away : Here comes a man of comfort whose advice Hath often still'd my brawling discontent <eos> I cry you mercy sir and well could wish You had not found me here so musical : Let me excuse me and believe me so My mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : 'Tis good though music oft hath such a charm To make bad good and good provoke to harm <eos> I pray you tell me hath any body inquired for me here to-day <eos> much upon this time have I promised here to meet <eos> MARIANA : You have not been inquired after : I have sat here all day <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I do constantly believe you <eos> The time is come even now <eos> I shall crave your forbearance a little : may be I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself <eos> MARIANA : I am always bound to you <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Very well met and well come <eos> What is the news from this good deputy <eos> ISABELLA : He hath a garden circummured with brick Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd And to that vineyard is a planched gate That makes his opening with this bigger key : This other doth command a little door Which from the vineyard to the garden leads There have I made my promise Upon the heavy middle of the night To call upon him <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : But shall you on your knowledge find this way <eos> ISABELLA : I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't : With whispering and most guilty diligence In action all of precept he did show me The way twice o'er <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Are there no other tokens Between you 'greed concerning her observance <eos> ISABELLA : No none but only a repair i' the dark And that I have possess'd him my most stay Can be but brief for I have made him know I have a servant comes with me along That stays upon me whose persuasion is I come about my brother <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : 'Tis well borne up <eos> I have not yet made known to Mariana A word of this <eos> What ho <eos> within <eos> come forth <eos> I pray you be acquainted with this maid She comes to do you good <eos> ISABELLA : I do desire the like <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Do you persuade yourself that I respect you <eos> MARIANA : Good friar I know you do and have found it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Take then this your companion by the hand Who hath a story ready for your ear <eos> I shall attend your leisure : but make haste The vaporous night approaches <eos> MARIANA : Will't please you walk aside <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : O place and greatness <eos> millions of false eyes Are stuck upon thee : volumes of report Run with these false and most contrarious quests Upon thy doings : thousand escapes of wit Make thee the father of their idle dreams And rack thee in their fancies <eos> Welcome how agreed <eos> ISABELLA : She'll take the enterprise upon her father If you advise it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It is not my consent But my entreaty too <eos> ISABELLA : Little have you to say When you depart from him but soft and low 'Remember now my brother <eos>' MARIANA : Fear me not <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Nor gentle daughter fear you not at all <eos> He is your husband on a pre-contract : To bring you thus together 'tis no sin Sith that the justice of your title to him Doth flourish the deceit <eos> Come let us go : Our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow <eos> Provost : Come hither sirrah <eos> Can you cut off a man's head <eos> POMPEY : If the man be a bachelor sir I can but if he be a married man he's his wife's head and I can never cut off a woman's head <eos> Provost : Come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer <eos> To-morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine <eos> Here is in our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper : if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been a notorious bawd <eos> POMPEY : Sir I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman <eos> I would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow partner <eos> Provost : What ho <eos> Abhorson <eos> Where's Abhorson there <eos> ABHORSON : Do you call sir <eos> Provost : Sirrah here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your execution <eos> If you think it meet compound with him by the year and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present and dismiss him <eos> He cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd <eos> ABHORSON : A bawd sir <eos> fie upon him <eos> he will discredit our mystery <eos> Provost : Go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale <eos> POMPEY : Pray sir by your good favour <eos>for surely sir a good favour you have but that you have a hanging look <eos>do you call sir your occupation a mystery <eos> ABHORSON : Ay sir a mystery POMPEY : Painting sir I have heard say is a mystery and your whores sir being members of my occupation using painting do prove my occupation a mystery : but what mystery there should be in hanging if I should be hanged I cannot imagine <eos> ABHORSON : Sir it is a mystery <eos> POMPEY : Proof <eos> ABHORSON : Every true man's apparel fits your thief : if it be too little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough : so every true man's apparel fits your thief <eos> Provost : Are you agreed <eos> POMPEY : Sir I will serve him for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth oftener ask forgiveness <eos> Provost : You sirrah provide your block and your axe to-morrow four o'clock <eos> ABHORSON : Come on bawd I will instruct thee in my trade follow <eos> POMPEY : I do desire to learn sir : and I hope if you have occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly sir for your kindness I owe you a good turn <eos> Provost : Call hither Barnardine and Claudio : The one has my pity not a jot the other Being a murderer though he were my brother <eos> Look here's the warrant Claudio for thy death : 'Tis now dead midnight and by eight to-morrow Thou must be made immortal <eos> Where's Barnardine <eos> CLAUDIO : As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones : He will not wake <eos> Provost : Who can do good on him <eos> Well go prepare yourself <eos> But hark what noise <eos> Heaven give your spirits comfort <eos> By and by <eos> I hope it is some pardon or reprieve For the most gentle Claudio <eos> Welcome father <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : The best and wholesomest spirts of the night Envelope you good Provost <eos> Who call'd here of late <eos> Provost : None since the curfew rung <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Not Isabel <eos> Provost : No <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : They will then ere't be long <eos> Provost : What comfort is for Claudio <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : There's some in hope <eos> Provost : It is a bitter deputy <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Not so not so his life is parallel'd Even with the stroke and line of his great justice : He doth with holy abstinence subdue That in himself which he spurs on his power To qualify in others : were he meal'd with that Which he corrects then were he tyrannous But this being so he's just <eos> Now are they come <eos> This is a gentle provost : seldom when The steeled gaoler is the friend of men <eos> How now <eos> what noise <eos> That spirit's possessed with haste That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes <eos> Provost : There he must stay until the officer Arise to let him in : he is call'd up <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Have you no countermand for Claudio yet But he must die to-morrow <eos> Provost : None sir none <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : As near the dawning provost as it is You shall hear more ere morning <eos> Provost : Happily You something know yet I believe there comes No countermand no such example have we : Besides upon the very siege of justice Lord Angelo hath to the public ear Profess'd the contrary <eos> This is his lordship's man <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : And here comes Claudio's pardon <eos> Messenger : Provost : I shall obey him <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Provost : I told you <eos> Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting-on methinks strangely for he hath not used it before <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Pray you let's hear <eos> Provost : DUKE VINCENTIO : What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon <eos> Provost : A Bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : How came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him <eos> I have heard it was ever his manner to do so <eos> Provost : His friends still wrought reprieves for him : and indeed his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo came not to an undoubtful proof <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It is now apparent <eos> Provost : Most manifest and not denied by himself <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Hath he born himself penitently in prison <eos> how seems he to be touched <eos> Provost : A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : He wants advice <eos> Provost : He will hear none : he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not : drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk <eos> We have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it : it hath not moved him at all <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : More of him anon <eos> There is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy : if I read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard <eos> Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenced him <eos> To make you understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy <eos> Provost : Pray sir in what <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : In the delaying death <eos> Provost : A lack how may I do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of Angelo <eos> I may make my case as Claudio's to cross this in the smallest <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : By the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions may be your guide <eos> Let this Barnardine be this morning executed and his head born to Angelo <eos> Provost : Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : O death's a great disguiser and you may add to it <eos> Shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death : you know the course is common <eos> If any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against it with my life <eos> Provost : Pardon me good father it is against my oath <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy <eos> Provost : To him and to his substitutes <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing <eos> Provost : But what likelihood is in that <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Not a resemblance but a certainty <eos> Yet since I see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you <eos> Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke : you know the character I doubt not and the signet is not strange to you <eos> Provost : I know them both <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : The contents of this is the return of the duke : you shall anon over-read it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here <eos> This is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the duke's death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ <eos> Look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd <eos> Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be : all difficulties are but easy when they are known <eos> Call your executioner and off with Barnardine's head : I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place <eos> Yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you <eos> Come away it is almost clear dawn <eos> POMPEY : I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession : one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own house for here be many of her old customers <eos> First here's young Master Rash he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger ninescore and seventeen pounds of which he made five marks ready money : marry then ginger was not much in request for the old women were all dead <eos> Then is there here one Master Caper at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer for some four suits of peach-coloured satin which now peaches him a beggar <eos> Then have we here young Dizy and young Master Deep-vow and Master Copperspur and Master Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man and young Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding and Master Forthlight the tilter and brave Master Shooty the great traveller and wild Half-can that stabbed Pots and I think forty more all great doers in our trade and are now 'for the Lord's sake <eos>' ABHORSON : Sirrah bring Barnardine hither <eos> POMPEY : Master Barnardine <eos> you must rise and be hanged <eos> Master Barnardine <eos> ABHORSON : What ho Barnardine <eos> BARNARDINE : POMPEY : Your friends sir the hangman <eos> You must be so good sir to rise and be put to death <eos> BARNARDINE : ABHORSON : Tell him he must awake and that quickly too <eos> POMPEY : Pray Master Barnardine awake till you are executed and sleep afterwards <eos> ABHORSON : Go in to him and fetch him out <eos> POMPEY : He is coming sir he is coming I hear his straw rustle <eos> ABHORSON : Is the axe upon the block sirrah <eos> POMPEY : Very ready sir <eos> BARNARDINE : How now Abhorson <eos> what's the news with you <eos> ABHORSON : Truly sir I would desire you to clap into your prayers for look you the warrant's come <eos> BARNARDINE : You rogue I have been drinking all night I am not fitted for 't <eos> POMPEY : O the better sir for he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day <eos> ABHORSON : Look you sir here comes your ghostly father : do we jest now think you <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart I am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you <eos> BARNARDINE : Friar not I I have been drinking hard all night and I will have more time to prepare me or they shall beat out my brains with billets : I will not consent to die this day that's certain <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : O sir you must : and therefore I beseech you Look forward on the journey you shall go <eos> BARNARDINE : I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : But hear you <eos> BARNARDINE : Not a word : if you have any thing to say to me come to my ward for thence will not I to-day <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Unfit to live or die : O gravel heart <eos> After him fellows bring him to the block <eos> Provost : Now sir how do you find the prisoner <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : A creature unprepared unmeet for death And to transport him in the mind he is Were damnable <eos> Provost : Here in the prison father There died this morning of a cruel fever One Ragozine a most notorious pirate A man of Claudio's years his beard and head Just of his colour <eos> What if we do omit This reprobate till he were well inclined And satisfy the deputy with the visage Of Ragozine more like to Claudio <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : O 'tis an accident that heaven provides <eos> Dispatch it presently the hour draws on Prefix'd by Angelo : see this be done And sent according to command whiles I Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die <eos> Provost : This shall be done good father presently <eos> But Barnardine must die this afternoon : And how shall we continue Claudio To save me from the danger that might come If he were known alive <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Let this be done <eos> Put them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudio : Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting To the under generation you shall find Your safety manifested <eos> Provost : I am your free dependant <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Quick dispatch and send the head to Angelo <eos> Now will I write letters to Angelo <eos> The provost he shall bear them whose contents Shall witness to him I am near at home And that by great injunctions I am bound To enter publicly : him I'll desire To meet me at the consecrated fount A league below the city and from thence By cold gradation and well-balanced form We shall proceed with Angelo <eos> Provost : Here is the head I'll carry it myself <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Convenient is it <eos> Make a swift return For I would commune with you of such things That want no ear but yours <eos> Provost : I'll make all speed <eos> ISABELLA : DUKE VINCENTIO : The tongue of Isabel <eos> She's come to know If yet her brother's pardon be come hither : But I will keep her ignorant of her good To make her heavenly comforts of despair When it is least expected <eos> ISABELLA : Ho by your leave <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Good morning to you fair and gracious daughter <eos> ISABELLA : The better given me by so holy a man <eos> Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : He hath released him Isabel from the world : His head is off and sent to Angelo <eos> ISABELLA : Nay but it is not so <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It is no other : show your wisdom daughter In your close patience <eos> ISABELLA : O I will to him and pluck out his eyes <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You shall not be admitted to his sight <eos> ISABELLA : Unhappy Claudio <eos> wretched Isabel <eos> Injurious world <eos> most damned Angelo <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot Forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven <eos> Mark what I say which you shall find By every syllable a faithful verity : The duke comes home to-morrow nay dry your eyes One of our convent and his confessor Gives me this instance : already he hath carried Notice to Escalus and Angelo Who do prepare to meet him at the gates There to give up their power <eos> If you can pace your wisdom In that good path that I would wish it go And you shall have your bosom on this wretch Grace of the duke revenges to your heart And general honour <eos> ISABELLA : I am directed by you <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : This letter then to Friar Peter give 'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return : Say by this token I desire his company At Mariana's house to-night <eos> Her cause and yours I'll perfect him withal and he shall bring you Before the duke and to the head of Angelo Accuse him home and home <eos> For my poor self I am combined by a sacred vow And shall be absent <eos> Wend you with this letter : Command these fretting waters from your eyes With a light heart trust not my holy order If I pervert your course <eos> Who's here <eos> LUCIO : Good even <eos> Friar where's the provost <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Not within sir <eos> LUCIO : O pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red : thou must be patient <eos> I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to 't <eos> But they say the duke will be here to-morrow <eos> By my troth Isabel I loved thy brother : if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in them <eos> LUCIO : Friar thou knowest not the duke so well as I do : he's a better woodman than thou takest him for <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Well you'll answer this one day <eos> Fare ye well <eos> LUCIO : Nay tarry I'll go along with thee I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enough <eos> LUCIO : I was once before him for getting a wench with child <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Did you such a thing <eos> LUCIO : Yes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Sir your company is fairer than honest <eos> Rest you well <eos> LUCIO : By my troth I'll go with thee to the lane's end : if bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of it <eos> Nay friar I am a kind of burr I shall stick <eos> ESCALUS : Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other <eos> ANGELO : In most uneven and distracted manner <eos> His actions show much like to madness : pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted <eos> And why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there ESCALUS : I guess not <eos> ANGELO : And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street <eos> ESCALUS : He shows his reason for that : to have a dispatch of complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against us <eos> ANGELO : Well I beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes i' the morn I'll call you at your house : give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him <eos> ESCALUS : I shall sir <eos> Fare you well <eos> ANGELO : Good night <eos> This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings <eos> A deflower'd maid <eos> And by an eminent body that enforced The law against it <eos> But that her tender shame Will not proclaim against her maiden loss How might she tongue me <eos> Yet reason dares her no For my authority bears of a credent bulk That no particular scandal once can touch But it confounds the breather <eos> He should have lived Save that riotous youth with dangerous sense Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge By so receiving a dishonour'd life With ransom of such shame <eos> Would yet he had lived <eos> A lack when once our grace we have forgot Nothing goes right : we would and we would not <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : These letters at fit time deliver me The provost knows our purpose and our plot <eos> The matter being afoot keep your instruction And hold you ever to our special drift Though sometimes you do blench from this to that As cause doth minister <eos> Go call at Flavius' house And tell him where I stay : give the like notice To Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate But send me Flavius first <eos> FRIAR PETER : It shall be speeded well <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I thank thee Varrius thou hast made good haste : Come we will walk <eos> There's other of our friends Will greet us here anon my gentle Varrius <eos> ISABELLA : To speak so indirectly I am loath : I would say the truth but to accuse him so That is your part : yet I am advised to do it He says to veil full purpose <eos> MARIANA : Be ruled by him <eos> ISABELLA : Besides he tells me that if peradventure He speak against me on the adverse side I should not think it strange for 'tis a physic That's bitter to sweet end <eos> MARIANA : I would Friar Peter <eos> ISABELLA : O peace <eos> the friar is come <eos> FRIAR PETER : Come I have found you out a stand most fit Where you may have such vantage on the duke He shall not pass you <eos> Twice have the trumpets sounded The generous and gravest citizens Have hent the gates and very near upon The duke is entering : therefore hence away <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : My very worthy cousin fairly met <eos> Our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you <eos> ANGELO : Happy return be to your royal grace <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Many and hearty thankings to you both <eos> We have made inquiry of you and we hear Such goodness of your justice that our soul Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks Forerunning more requital <eos> ANGELO : You make my bonds still greater <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : O your desert speaks loud and I should wrong it To lock it in the wards of covert bosom When it deserves with characters of brass A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time And razure of oblivion <eos> Give me your hand And let the subject see to make them know That outward courtesies would fain proclaim Favours that keep within <eos> Come Escalus You must walk by us on our other hand And good supporters are you <eos> FRIAR PETER : Now is your time : speak loud and kneel before him <eos> ISABELLA : Justice O royal duke <eos> Vail your regard Upon a wrong'd I would fain have said a maid <eos> O worthy prince dishonour not your eye By throwing it on any other object Till you have heard me in my true complaint And given me justice justice justice justice <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Relate your wrongs in what <eos> by whom <eos> be brief <eos> Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice : Reveal yourself to him <eos> ISABELLA : O worthy duke You bid me seek redemption of the devil : Hear me yourself for that which I must speak Must either punish me not being believed Or wring redress from you <eos> Hear me O hear me here <eos> ANGELO : My lord her wits I fear me are not firm : She hath been a suitor to me for her brother Cut off by course of justice <eos> ISABELLA : By course of justice <eos> ANGELO : And she will speak most bitterly and strange <eos> ISABELLA : Most strange but yet most truly will I speak : That Angelo's forsworn is it not strange <eos> That Angelo's a murderer is 't not strange <eos> That Angelo is an adulterous thief An hypocrite a virgin-violator Is it not strange and strange <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Nay it is ten times strange <eos> ISABELLA : It is not truer he is Angelo Than this is all as true as it is strange : Nay it is ten times true for truth is truth To the end of reckoning <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Away with her <eos> Poor soul She speaks this in the infirmity of sense <eos> ISABELLA : O prince I conjure thee as thou believest There is another comfort than this world That thou neglect me not with that opinion That I am touch'd with madness <eos> Make not impossible That which but seems unlike : 'tis not impossible But one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground May seem as shy as grave as just as absolute As Angelo even so may Angelo In all his dressings characts titles forms Be an arch-villain believe it royal prince : If he be less he's nothing but he's more Had I more name for badness <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : By mine honesty If she be mad <eos>as I believe no other <eos> Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense Such a dependency of thing on thing As e'er I heard in madness <eos> ISABELLA : O gracious duke Harp not on that nor do not banish reason For inequality but let your reason serve To make the truth appear where it seems hid And hide the false seems true <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Many that are not mad Have sure more lack of reason <eos> What would you say <eos> ISABELLA : I am the sister of one Claudio Condemn'd upon the act of fornication To lose his head condemn'd by Angelo : I in probation of a sisterhood Was sent to by my brother one Lucio As then the messenger <eos> LUCIO : That's I an't like your grace : I came to her from Claudio and desired her To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo For her poor brother's pardon <eos> ISABELLA : That's he indeed <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You were not bid to speak <eos> LUCIO : No my good lord Nor wish'd to hold my peace <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I wish you now then Pray you take note of it : and when you have A business for yourself pray heaven you then Be perfect <eos> LUCIO : I warrant your honour <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : The warrants for yourself take heed to't <eos> ISABELLA : This gentleman told somewhat of my tale <eos> LUCIO : Right <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It may be right but you are i' the wrong To speak before your time <eos> Proceed <eos> ISABELLA : I went To this pernicious caitiff deputy <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : That's somewhat madly spoken <eos> ISABELLA : Pardon it The phrase is to the matter <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Mended again <eos> The matter proceed <eos> ISABELLA : In brief to set the needless process by How I persuaded how I pray'd and kneel'd How he refell'd me and how I replied <eos> For this was of much length <eos>the vile conclusion I now begin with grief and shame to utter : He would not but by gift of my chaste body To his concupiscible intemperate lust Release my brother and after much debatement My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour And I did yield to him : but the next morn betimes His purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant For my poor brother's head <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : This is most likely <eos> ISABELLA : O that it were as like as it is true <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : By heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speak'st Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour In hateful practise <eos> First his integrity Stands without blemish <eos> Next it imports no reason That with such vehemency he should pursue Faults proper to himself : if he had so offended He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself And not have cut him off <eos> Some one hath set you on : Confess the truth and say by whose advice Thou camest here to complain <eos> ISABELLA : And is this all <eos> Then O you blessed ministers above Keep me in patience and with ripen'd time Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up In countenance <eos> Heaven shield your grace from woe As I thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I know you'ld fain be gone <eos> An officer <eos> To prison with her <eos> Shall we thus permit A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall On him so near us <eos> This needs must be a practise <eos> Who knew of Your intent and coming hither <eos> ISABELLA : One that I would were here Friar Lodowick <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : A ghostly father belike <eos> Who knows that Lodowick <eos> LUCIO : My lord I know him 'tis a meddling friar I do not like the man : had he been lay my lord For certain words he spake against your grace In your retirement I had swinged him soundly <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Words against me <eos> this is a good friar belike <eos> And to set on this wretched woman here Against our substitute <eos> Let this friar be found <eos> LUCIO : But yesternight my lord she and that friar I saw them at the prison : a saucy friar A very scurvy fellow <eos> FRIAR PETER : Blessed be your royal grace <eos> I have stood by my lord and I have heard Your royal ear abused <eos> First hath this woman Most wrongfully accused your substitute Who is as free from touch or soil with her As she from one ungot <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : We did believe no less <eos> Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of <eos> FRIAR PETER : I know him for a man divine and holy Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler As he's reported by this gentleman And on my trust a man that never yet Did as he vouches misreport your grace <eos> LUCIO : My lord most villanously believe it <eos> FRIAR PETER : Well he in time may come to clear himself But at this instant he is sick my lord Of a strange fever <eos> Upon his mere request Being come to knowledge that there was complaint Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo came I hither To speak as from his mouth what he doth know Is true and false and what he with his oath And all probation will make up full clear Whensoever he's convented <eos> First for this woman <eos> To justify this worthy nobleman So vulgarly and personally accused Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes Till she herself confess it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Good friar let's hear it <eos> Do you not smile at this Lord Angelo <eos> O heaven the vanity of wretched fools <eos> Give us some seats <eos> Come cousin Angelo In this I'll be impartial be you judge Of your own cause <eos> Is this the witness friar <eos> First let her show her face and after speak <eos> MARIANA : Pardon my lord I will not show my face Until my husband bid me <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : What are you married <eos> MARIANA : No my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Are you a maid <eos> MARIANA : No my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : A widow then <eos> MARIANA : Neither my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Why you are nothing then : neither maid widow nor wife <eos> LUCIO : My lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid widow nor wife <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Silence that fellow : I would he had some cause To prattle for himself <eos> LUCIO : Well my lord <eos> MARIANA : My lord I do confess I ne'er was married And I confess besides I am no maid : I have known my husband yet my husband Knows not that ever he knew me <eos> LUCIO : He was drunk then my lord : it can be no better <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : For the benefit of silence would thou wert so too <eos> LUCIO : Well my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : This is no witness for Lord Angelo <eos> MARIANA : Now I come to't my lord She that accuses him of fornication In self-same manner doth accuse my husband And charges him my lord with such a time When I'll depose I had him in mine arms With all the effect of love <eos> ANGELO : Charges she more than me <eos> MARIANA : Not that I know <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : No <eos> you say your husband <eos> MARIANA : Why just my lord and that is Angelo Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's <eos> ANGELO : This is a strange abuse <eos> Let's see thy face <eos> MARIANA : My husband bids me now I will unmask <eos> This is that face thou cruel Angelo Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on This is the hand which with a vow'd contract Was fast belock'd in thine this is the body That took away the match from Isabel And did supply thee at thy garden-house In her imagined person <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Know you this woman <eos> LUCIO : Carnally she says <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Sirrah no more <eos> LUCIO : Enough my lord <eos> ANGELO : My lord I must confess I know this woman : And five years since there was some speech of marriage Betwixt myself and her which was broke off Partly for that her promised proportions Came short of composition but in chief For that her reputation was disvalued In levity : since which time of five years I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her Upon my faith and honour <eos> MARIANA : Noble prince As there comes light from heaven and words from breath As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue I am affianced this man's wife as strongly As words could make up vows : and my good lord But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house He knew me as a wife <eos> As this is true Let me in safety raise me from my knees Or else for ever be confixed here A marble monument <eos> ANGELO : I did but smile till now : Now good my lord give me the scope of justice My patience here is touch'd <eos> I do perceive These poor informal women are no more But instruments of some more mightier member That sets them on : let me have way my lord To find this practise out <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Ay with my heart And punish them to your height of pleasure <eos> Thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman Compact with her that's gone think'st thou thy oaths Though they would swear down each particular saint Were testimonies against his worth and credit That's seal'd in approbation <eos> You Lord Escalus Sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains To find out this abuse whence 'tis derived <eos> There is another friar that set them on Let him be sent for <eos> FRIAR PETER : Would he were here my lord <eos> for he indeed Hath set the women on to this complaint : Your provost knows the place where he abides And he may fetch him <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Go do it instantly <eos> And you my noble and well-warranted cousin Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth Do with your injuries as seems you best In any chastisement : I for a while will leave you But stir not you till you have well determined Upon these slanderers <eos> ESCALUS : My lord we'll do it throughly <eos> Signior Lucio did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person <eos> LUCIO : 'Cucullus non facit monachum :' honest in nothing but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most villanous speeches of the duke <eos> ESCALUS : We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him : we shall find this friar a notable fellow <eos> LUCIO : As any in Vienna on my word <eos> ESCALUS : Call that same Isabel here once again I would speak with her <eos> Pray you my lord give me leave to question you shall see how I'll handle her <eos> LUCIO : Not better than he by her own report <eos> ESCALUS : Say you <eos> LUCIO : Marry sir I think if you handled her privately she would sooner confess : perchance publicly she'll be ashamed <eos> ESCALUS : I will go darkly to work with her <eos> LUCIO : That's the way for women are light at midnight <eos> ESCALUS : Come on mistress : here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said <eos> LUCIO : My lord here comes the rascal I spoke of here with the provost <eos> ESCALUS : In very good time : speak not you to him till we call upon you <eos> LUCIO : Mum <eos> ESCALUS : Come sir : did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo <eos> they have confessed you did <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : 'Tis false <eos> ESCALUS : How <eos> know you where you are <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Respect to your great place <eos> and let the devil Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne <eos> Where is the duke <eos> 'tis he should hear me speak <eos> ESCALUS : The duke's in us and we will hear you speak : Look you speak justly <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Boldly at least <eos> But O poor souls Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox <eos> Good night to your redress <eos> Is the duke gone <eos> Then is your cause gone too <eos> The duke's unjust Thus to retort your manifest appeal And put your trial in the villain's mouth Which here you come to accuse <eos> LUCIO : This is the rascal this is he I spoke of <eos> ESCALUS : Why thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women To accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth And in the witness of his proper ear To call him villain <eos> and then to glance from him To the duke himself to tax him with injustice <eos> Take him hence to the rack with him <eos> We'll touse you Joint by joint but we will know his purpose <eos> What 'unjust' <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Be not so hot the duke Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he Dare rack his own : his subject am I not Nor here provincial <eos> My business in this state Made me a looker on here in Vienna Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble Till it o'er-run the stew laws for all faults But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop As much in mock as mark <eos> ESCALUS : Slander to the state <eos> Away with him to prison <eos> ANGELO : What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio <eos> Is this the man that you did tell us of <eos> LUCIO : 'Tis he my lord <eos> Come hither goodman baldpate : do you know me <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I remember you sir by the sound of your voice : I met you at the prison in the absence of the duke <eos> LUCIO : O did you so <eos> And do you remember what you said of the duke <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Most notedly sir <eos> LUCIO : Do you so sir <eos> And was the duke a fleshmonger a fool and a coward as you then reported him to be <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You must sir change persons with me ere you make that my report : you indeed spoke so of him and much more much worse <eos> LUCIO : O thou damnable fellow <eos> Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I protest I love the duke as I love myself <eos> ANGELO : Hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses <eos> ESCALUS : Such a fellow is not to be talked withal <eos> Away with him to prison <eos> Where is the provost <eos> Away with him to prison <eos> lay bolts enough upon him : let him speak no more <eos> Away with those giglots too and with the other confederate companion <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : ANGELO : What resists he <eos> Help him Lucio <eos> LUCIO : Come sir come sir come sir foh sir <eos> Why you bald-pated lying rascal you must be hooded must you <eos> Show your knave's visage with a pox to you <eos> show your sheep-biting face and be hanged an hour <eos> Will't not off <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke <eos> First provost let me bail these gentle three <eos> Sneak not away sir for the friar and you Must have a word anon <eos> Lay hold on him <eos> LUCIO : This may prove worse than hanging <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : ANGELO : O my dread lord I should be guiltier than my guiltiness To think I can be undiscernible When I perceive your grace like power divine Hath look'd upon my passes <eos> Then good prince No longer session hold upon my shame But let my trial be mine own confession : Immediate sentence then and sequent death Is all the grace I beg <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Come hither Mariana <eos> Say wast thou e'er contracted to this woman <eos> ANGELO : I was my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Go take her hence and marry her instantly <eos> Do you the office friar which consummate Return him here again <eos> Go with him provost <eos> ESCALUS : My lord I am more amazed at his dishonour Than at the strangeness of it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Come hither Isabel <eos> Your friar is now your prince : as I was then Advertising and holy to your business Not changing heart with habit I am still Attorney'd at your service <eos> ISABELLA : O give me pardon That I your vassal have employ'd and pain'd Your unknown sovereignty <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You are pardon'd Isabel : And now dear maid be you as free to us <eos> Your brother's death I know sits at your heart And you may marvel why I obscured myself Labouring to save his life and would not rather Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power Than let him so be lost <eos> O most kind maid It was the swift celerity of his death Which I did think with slower foot came on That brain'd my purpose <eos> But peace be with him <eos> That life is better life past fearing death Than that which lives to fear : make it your comfort So happy is your brother <eos> ISABELLA : I do my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : For this new-married man approaching here Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd Your well defended honour you must pardon For Mariana's sake : but as he adjudged your brother <eos> Being criminal in double violation Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach Thereon dependent for your brother's life <eos> The very mercy of the law cries out Most audible even from his proper tongue 'An Angelo for Claudio death for death <eos>' Haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure Like doth quit like and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE <eos> Then Angelo thy fault's thus manifested Which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage <eos> We do condemn thee to the very block Where Claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste <eos> Away with him <eos> MARIANA : O my most gracious lord I hope you will not mock me with a husband <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : It is your husband mock'd you with a husband <eos> Consenting to the safeguard of your honour I thought your marriage fit else imputation For that he knew you might reproach your life And choke your good to come for his possessions Although by confiscation they are ours We do instate and widow you withal To buy you a better husband <eos> MARIANA : O my dear lord I crave no other nor no better man <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Never crave him we are definitive <eos> MARIANA : Gentle my liege <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : You do but lose your labour <eos> Away with him to death <eos> Now sir to you <eos> MARIANA : O my good lord <eos> Sweet Isabel take my part Lend me your knees and all my life to come I'll lend you all my life to do you service <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Against all sense you do importune her : Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break And take her hence in horror <eos> MARIANA : Isabel Sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me Hold up your hands say nothing I'll speak all <eos> They say best men are moulded out of faults And for the most become much more the better For being a little bad : so may my husband <eos> O Isabel will you not lend a knee <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : He dies for Claudio's death <eos> ISABELLA : Most bounteous sir Look if it please you on this man condemn'd As if my brother lived : I partly think A due sincerity govern'd his deeds Till he did look on me : since it is so Let him not die <eos> My brother had but justice In that he did the thing for which he died : For Angelo His act did not o'ertake his bad intent And must be buried but as an intent That perish'd by the way : thoughts are no subjects Intents but merely thoughts <eos> MARIANA : Merely my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Your suit's unprofitable stand up I say <eos> I have bethought me of another fault <eos> Provost how came it Claudio was beheaded At an unusual hour <eos> Provost : It was commanded so <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Had you a special warrant for the deed <eos> Provost : No my good lord it was by private message <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : For which I do discharge you of your office : Give up your keys <eos> Provost : Pardon me noble lord : I thought it was a fault but knew it not Yet did repent me after more advice For testimony whereof one in the prison That should by private order else have died I have reserved alive <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : What's he <eos> Provost : His name is Barnardine <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : I would thou hadst done so by Claudio <eos> Go fetch him hither let me look upon him <eos> ESCALUS : I am sorry one so learned and so wise As you Lord Angelo have still appear'd Should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood <eos> And lack of temper'd judgment afterward <eos> ANGELO : I am sorry that such sorrow I procure : And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart That I crave death more willingly than mercy 'Tis my deserving and I do entreat it <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Which is that Barnardine <eos> Provost : This my lord <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : There was a friar told me of this man <eos> Sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul <eos> That apprehends no further than this world And squarest thy life according <eos> Thou'rt condemn'd : But for those earthly faults I quit them all And pray thee take this mercy to provide For better times to come <eos> Friar advise him I leave him to your hand <eos> What muffled fellow's that <eos> Provost : This is another prisoner that I saved <eos> Who should have died when Claudio lost his head As like almost to Claudio as himself <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : LUCIO : 'Faith my lord <eos> I spoke it but according to the trick <eos> If you will hang me for it you may but I had rather it would please you I might be whipt <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Whipt first sir and hanged after <eos> Proclaim it provost round about the city <eos> Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow As I have heard him swear himself there's one Whom he begot with child let her appear And he shall marry her : the nuptial finish'd Let him be whipt and hang'd <eos> LUCIO : I beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore <eos> Your highness said even now I made you a duke : good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Upon mine honour thou shalt marry her <eos> Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits <eos> Take him to prison And see our pleasure herein executed <eos> LUCIO : Marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping and hanging <eos> DUKE VINCENTIO : Slandering a prince deserves it <eos> She Claudio that you wrong'd look you restore <eos> Joy to you Mariana <eos> Love her Angelo : I have confess'd her and I know her virtue <eos> Thanks good friend Escalus for thy much goodness : There's more behind that is more gratulate <eos> Thanks provost for thy care and secrecy : We shill employ thee in a worthier place <eos> Forgive him Angelo that brought you home The head of Ragozine for Claudio's : The offence pardons itself <eos> Dear Isabel I have a motion much imports your good Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine <eos> So bring us to our palace where we'll show What's yet behind that's meet you all should know <eos> SLY : I'll pheeze you in faith <eos> Hostess : A pair of stocks you rogue <eos> SLY : Ye are a baggage : the Slys are no rogues look in the chronicles we came in with Richard Conqueror <eos> Therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide : sessa <eos> Hostess : You will not pay for the glasses you have burst <eos> SLY : No not a denier <eos> Go by Jeronimy : go to thy cold bed and warm thee <eos> Hostess : I know my remedy I must go fetch the third <eos>borough <eos> SLY : Third or fourth or fifth borough I'll answer him by law : I'll not budge an inch boy : let him come and kindly <eos> Lord : Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds : Brach Merriman the poor cur is emboss'd And couple Clowder with the deep <eos>mouth'd brach <eos> Saw'st thou not boy how Silver made it good At the hedge-corner in the coldest fault <eos> I would not lose the dog for twenty pound <eos> First Huntsman : Why Belman is as good as he my lord He cried upon it at the merest loss And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent : Trust me I take him for the better dog <eos> Lord : Thou art a fool : if Echo were as fleet I would esteem him worth a dozen such <eos> But sup them well and look unto them all : To-morrow I intend to hunt again <eos> First Huntsman : I will my lord <eos> Lord : What's here <eos> one dead or drunk <eos> See doth he breathe <eos> Second Huntsman : He breathes my lord <eos> Were he not warm'd with ale This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly <eos> Lord : O monstrous beast <eos> how like a swine he lies <eos> Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image <eos> Sirs I will practise on this drunken man <eos> What think you if he were convey'd to bed Wrapp'd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers A most delicious banquet by his bed And brave attendants near him when he wakes Would not the beggar then forget himself <eos> First Huntsman : Believe me lord I think he cannot choose <eos> Second Huntsman : It would seem strange unto him when he waked <eos> Lord : Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy <eos> Then take him up and manage well the jest : Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures : Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet : Procure me music ready when he wakes To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound And if he chance to speak be ready straight And with a low submissive reverence Say 'What is it your honour will command <eos>' Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers Another bear the ewer the third a diaper And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands <eos>' Some one be ready with a costly suit And ask him what apparel he will wear Another tell him of his hounds and horse And that his lady mourns at his disease : Persuade him that he hath been lunatic And when he says he is say that he dreams For he is nothing but a mighty lord <eos> This do and do it kindly gentle sirs : It will be pastime passing excellent If it be husbanded with modesty <eos> First Huntsman : My lord I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is <eos> Lord : Take him up gently and to bed with him And each one to his office when he wakes <eos> Sirrah go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds : Belike some noble gentleman that means Travelling some journey to repose him here <eos> How now <eos> who is it <eos> Servant : An't please your honour players That offer service to your lordship <eos> Lord : Bid them come near <eos> Now fellows you are welcome <eos> Players : We thank your honour <eos> Lord : Do you intend to stay with me tonight <eos> A Player : So please your lordship to accept our duty <eos> Lord : With all my heart <eos> This fellow I remember Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son : 'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well : I have forgot your name but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd <eos> A Player : I think 'twas Soto that your honour means <eos> Lord : 'Tis very true : thou didst it excellent <eos> Well you are come to me in a happy time The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much <eos> There is a lord will hear you play to-night : But I am doubtful of your modesties Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior <eos> For yet his honour never heard a play <eos> You break into some merry passion And so offend him for I tell you sirs If you should smile he grows impatient <eos> A Player : Fear not my lord : we can contain ourselves Were he the veriest antic in the world <eos> Lord : Go sirrah take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one : Let them want nothing that my house affords <eos> Sirrah go you to Barthol'mew my page And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady : That done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber And call him 'madam' do him obeisance <eos> Tell him from me as he will win my love He bear himself with honourable action Such as he hath observed in noble ladies Unto their lords by them accomplished : Such duty to the drunkard let him do With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy And say 'What is't your honour will command Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty and make known her love <eos>' And then with kind embracements tempting kisses And with declining head into his bosom Bid him shed tears as being overjoy'd To see her noble lord restored to health Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar : And if the boy have not a woman's gift To rain a shower of commanded tears An onion will do well for such a shift Which in a napkin being close convey'd Shall in despite enforce a watery eye <eos> See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst : Anon I'll give thee more instructions <eos> I know the boy will well usurp the grace Voice gait and action of a gentlewoman : I long to hear him call the drunkard husband And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant <eos> I'll in to counsel them haply my presence May well abate the over-merry spleen Which otherwise would grow into extremes <eos> SLY : For God's sake a pot of small ale <eos> First Servant : Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack <eos> Second Servant : Will't please your honour taste of these conserves <eos> Third Servant : What raiment will your honour wear to-day <eos> SLY : I am Christophero Sly call not me 'honour' nor 'lordship :' I ne'er drank sack in my life and if you give me any conserves give me conserves of beef : ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear for I have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay sometimes more feet than shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather <eos> Lord : Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour <eos> O that a mighty man of such descent Of such possessions and so high esteem Should be infused with so foul a spirit <eos> SLY : What would you make me mad <eos> Am not I Christopher Sly old Sly's son of Burtonheath by birth a pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bear-herd and now by present profession a tinker <eos> Ask Marian Hacket the fat ale-wife of Wincot if she know me not : if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom <eos> What <eos> I am not bestraught : here's <eos> Third Servant : O this it is that makes your lady mourn <eos> Second Servant : O this is it that makes your servants droop <eos> Lord : Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house As beaten hence by your strange lunacy <eos> O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment And banish hence these abject lowly dreams <eos> Look how thy servants do attend on thee Each in his office ready at thy beck <eos> Wilt thou have music <eos> hark <eos> Apollo plays And twenty caged nightingales do sing : Or wilt thou sleep <eos> we'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis <eos> Say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground : Or wilt thou ride <eos> thy horses shall be trapp'd Their harness studded all with gold and pearl <eos> Dost thou love hawking <eos> thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt <eos> Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth <eos> First Servant : Say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe <eos> Second Servant : Dost thou love pictures <eos> we will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook And Cytherea all in sedges hid Which seem to move and wanton with her breath Even as the waving sedges play with wind <eos> Lord : We'll show thee Io as she was a maid And how she was beguiled and surprised As lively painted as the deed was done <eos> Third Servant : Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn <eos> Lord : Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord : Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age <eos> First Servant : And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face She was the fairest creature in the world And yet she is inferior to none <eos> SLY : Am I a lord <eos> and have I such a lady <eos> Or do I dream <eos> or have I dream'd till now <eos> I do not sleep : I see I hear I speak I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things : Upon my life I am a lord indeed And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly <eos> Well bring our lady hither to our sight And once again a pot o' the smallest ale <eos> Second Servant : Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands <eos> O how we joy to see your wit restored <eos> O that once more you knew but what you are <eos> These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or when you waked so waked as if you slept <eos> SLY : These fifteen years <eos> by my fay a goodly nap <eos> But did I never speak of all that time <eos> First Servant : O yes my lord but very idle words : For though you lay here in this goodly chamber Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door And rail upon the hostess of the house And say you would present her at the leet Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts : Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket <eos> SLY : Ay the woman's maid of the house <eos> Third Servant : Why sir you know no house nor no such maid Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell And twenty more such names and men as these Which never were nor no man ever saw <eos> SLY : Now Lord be thanked for my good amends <eos> ALL : Amen <eos> SLY : I thank thee : thou shalt not lose by it <eos> Page : How fares my noble lord <eos> SLY : Marry I fare well for here is cheer enough <eos> Where is my wife <eos> Page : Here noble lord : what is thy will with her <eos> SLY : Are you my wife and will not call me husband <eos> My men should call me 'lord :' I am your goodman <eos> Page : My husband and my lord my lord and husband I am your wife in all obedience <eos> SLY : I know it well <eos> What must I call her <eos> Lord : Madam <eos> SLY : Al'ce madam or Joan madam <eos> Lord : 'Madam' and nothing else : so lords call ladies <eos> SLY : Madam wife they say that I have dream'd And slept above some fifteen year or more <eos> Page : Ay and the time seems thirty unto me Being all this time abandon'd from your bed <eos> SLY : 'Tis much <eos> Servants leave me and her alone <eos> Madam undress you and come now to bed <eos> Page : Thrice noble lord let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two Or if not so until the sun be set : For your physicians have expressly charged In peril to incur your former malady That I should yet absent me from your bed : I hope this reason stands for my excuse <eos> SLY : Ay it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long <eos> But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again : I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood <eos> Messenger : Your honour's players heating your amendment Are come to play a pleasant comedy For so your doctors hold it very meet Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy : Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life <eos> SLY : Marry I will let them play it <eos> Is not a comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick <eos> Page : No my good lord it is more pleasing stuff <eos> SLY : What household stuff <eos> Page : It is a kind of history <eos> SLY : Well well see't <eos> Come madam wife sit by my side and let the world slip : we shall ne'er be younger <eos> LUCENTIO : Tranio since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua nursery of arts I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy The pleasant garden of great Italy And by my father's love and leave am arm'd With his good will and thy good company My trusty servant well approved in all Here let us breathe and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies <eos> Pisa renown'd for grave citizens Gave me my being and my father first A merchant of great traffic through the world Vincetino come of Bentivolii <eos> Vincetino's son brought up in Florence It shall become to serve all hopes conceived To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds : And therefore Tranio for the time I study Virtue and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achieved <eos> Tell me thy mind for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst <eos> TRANIO : Mi perdonato gentle master mine I am in all affected as yourself Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy <eos> Only good master while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline Let's be no stoics nor no stocks I pray Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured : Balk logic with acquaintance that you have And practise rhetoric in your common talk Music and poesy use to quicken you The mathematics and the metaphysics Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en : In brief sir study what you most affect <eos> LUCENTIO : Gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise <eos> If Biondello thou wert come ashore We could at once put us in readiness And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget <eos> But stay a while : what company is this <eos> TRANIO : Master some show to welcome us to town <eos> BAPTISTA : Gentlemen importune me no farther For how I firmly am resolved you know That is not bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder : If either of you both love Katharina Because I know you well and love you well Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure <eos> GREMIO : KATHARINA : I pray you sir is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates <eos> HORTENSIO : Mates maid <eos> how mean you that <eos> no mates for you Unless you were of gentler milder mould <eos> KATHARINA : I'faith sir you shall never need to fear : I wis it is not half way to her heart But if it were doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool And paint your face and use you like a fool <eos> HORTENSIA : From all such devils good Lord deliver us <eos> GREMIO : And me too good Lord <eos> TRANIO : Hush master <eos> here's some good pastime toward : That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward <eos> LUCENTIO : But in the other's silence do I see Maid's mild behavior and sobriety <eos> Peace Tranio <eos> TRANIO : Well said master mum <eos> and gaze your fill <eos> BAPTISTA : Gentlemen that I may soon make good What I have said Bianca get you in : And let it not displease thee good Bianca For I will love thee ne'er the less my girl <eos> KATHARINA : A pretty peat <eos> it is best Put finger in the eye an she knew why <eos> BIANCA : Sister content you in my discontent <eos> Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe : My books and instruments shall be my company On them to took and practise by myself <eos> LUCENTIO : Hark Tranio <eos> thou may'st hear Minerva speak <eos> HORTENSIO : Signior Baptista will you be so strange <eos> Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca's grief <eos> GREMIO : Why will you mew her up Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue <eos> BAPTISTA : Gentlemen content ye I am resolved : Go in Bianca : And for I know she taketh most delight In music instruments and poetry Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth <eos> If you Hortensio Or Signior Gremio you know any such Prefer them hither for to cunning men I will be very kind and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up : And so farewell <eos> Katharina you may stay For I have more to commune with Bianca <eos> KATHARINA : Why and I trust I may go too may I not <eos> What shall I be appointed hours as though belike I knew not what to take and what to leave ha <eos> GREMIO : You may go to the devil's dam : your gifts are so good here's none will hold you <eos> Their love is not so great Hortensio but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out : our cakes dough on both sides <eos> Farewell : yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights I will wish him to her father <eos> HORTENSIO : So will I Signior Gremio : but a word I pray <eos> Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love to labour and effect one thing specially <eos> GREMIO : What's that I pray <eos> HORTENSIO : Marry sir to get a husband for her sister <eos> GREMIO : A husband <eos> a devil <eos> HORTENSIO : I say a husband <eos> GREMIO : I say a devil <eos> Thinkest thou Hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell <eos> HORTENSIO : Tush Gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough <eos> GREMIO : I cannot tell but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whipped at the high cross every morning <eos> HORTENSIO : Faith as you say there's small choice in rotten apples <eos> But come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have to't a fresh <eos> Sweet Bianca <eos> Happy man be his dole <eos> He that runs fastest gets the ring <eos> How say you Signior Gremio <eos> GREMIO : I am agreed and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her <eos> Come on <eos> TRANIO : I pray sir tell me is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold <eos> LUCENTIO : O Tranio till I found it to be true I never thought it possible or likely But see while idly I stood looking on I found the effect of love in idleness : And now in plainness do confess to thee That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the queen of Carthage was Tranio I burn I pine I perish Tranio If I achieve not this young modest girl <eos> Counsel me Tranio for I know thou canst Assist me Tranio for I know thou wilt <eos> TRANIO : Master it is no time to chide you now Affection is not rated from the heart : If love have touch'd you nought remains but so 'Redime te captum quam queas minimo <eos>' LUCENTIO : Gramercies lad go forward this contents : The rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound <eos> TRANIO : Master you look'd so longly on the maid Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all <eos> LUCENTIO : O yes I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had That made great Jove to humble him to her hand <eos> When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand <eos> TRANIO : Saw you no more <eos> mark'd you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din <eos> LUCENTIO : Tranio I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air : Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her <eos> TRANIO : Nay then 'tis time to stir him from his trance <eos> I pray awake sir : if you love the maid Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her <eos> Thus it stands : Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd That till the father rid his hands of her Master your love must live a maid at home And therefore has he closely mew'd her up Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors <eos> LUCENTIO : Ah Tranio what a cruel father's he <eos> But art thou not advised he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her <eos> TRANIO : Ay marry am I sir and now 'tis plotted <eos> LUCENTIO : I have it Tranio <eos> TRANIO : Master for my hand Both our inventions meet and jump in one <eos> LUCENTIO : Tell me thine first <eos> TRANIO : You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid : That's your device <eos> LUCENTIO : It is : may it be done <eos> TRANIO : Not possible for who shall bear your part And be in Padua here Vincentio's son Keep house and ply his book welcome his friends Visit his countrymen and banquet them <eos> LUCENTIO : Basta content thee for I have it full <eos> We have not yet been seen in any house Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces For man or master then it follows thus Thou shalt be master Tranio in my stead Keep house and port and servants as I should : I will some other be some Florentine Some Neapolitan or meaner man of Pisa <eos> 'Tis hatch'd and shall be so : Tranio at once Uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak : When Biondello comes he waits on thee But I will charm him first to keep his tongue <eos> TRANIO : So had you need <eos> In brief sir sith it your pleasure is And I am tied to be obedient For so your father charged me at our parting 'Be serviceable to my son' quoth he Although I think 'twas in another sense I am content to be Lucentio Because so well I love Lucentio <eos> LUCENTIO : Tranio be so because Lucentio loves : And let me be a slave to achieve that maid Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye <eos> Here comes the rogue <eos> Sirrah where have you been <eos> BIONDELLO : Where have I been <eos> Nay how now <eos> where are you <eos> Master has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes <eos> Or you stolen his <eos> or both <eos> pray what's the news <eos> LUCENTIO : Sirrah come hither : 'tis no time to jest And therefore frame your manners to the time <eos> Your fellow Tranio here to save my life Puts my apparel and my countenance on And I for my escape have put on his For in a quarrel since I came ashore I kill'd a man and fear I was descried : Wait you on him I charge you as becomes While I make way from hence to save my life : You understand me <eos> BIONDELLO : I sir <eos> ne'er a whit <eos> LUCENTIO : And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth : Tranio is changed into Lucentio <eos> BIONDELLO : The better for him : would I were so too <eos> TRANIO : So could I faith boy to have the next wish after That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter <eos> But sirrah not for my sake but your master's I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies : When I am alone why then I am Tranio But in all places else your master Lucentio <eos> LUCENTIO : Tranio let's go : one thing more rests that thyself execute to make one among these wooers : if thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty <eos> First Servant : My lord you nod you do not mind the play <eos> SLY : Yes by Saint Anne do I <eos> A good matter surely : comes there any more of it <eos> Page : My lord 'tis but begun <eos> SLY : 'Tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady : would 'twere done <eos> PETRUCHIO : Verona for a while I take my leave To see my friends in Padua but of all My best beloved and approved friend Hortensio and I trow this is his house <eos> Here sirrah Grumio knock I say <eos> GRUMIO : Knock sir <eos> whom should I knock <eos> is there man has rebused your worship <eos> PETRUCHIO : Villain I say knock me here soundly <eos> GRUMIO : Knock you here sir <eos> why sir what am I sir that I should knock you here sir <eos> PETRUCHIO : Villain I say knock me at this gate And rap me well or I'll knock your knave's pate <eos> GRUMIO : My master is grown quarrelsome <eos> I should knock you first And then I know after who comes by the worst <eos> PETRUCHIO : Will it not be <eos> Faith sirrah an you'll not knock I'll ring it I'll try how you can sol fa and sing it <eos> GRUMIO : Help masters help <eos> my master is mad <eos> PETRUCHIO : Now knock when I bid you sirrah villain <eos> HORTENSIO : How now <eos> what's the matter <eos> My old friend Grumio <eos> and my good friend Petruchio <eos> How do you all at Verona <eos> PETRUCHIO : Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray <eos> 'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say <eos> HORTENSIO : 'Alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor mio Petruchio <eos>' Rise Grumio rise : we will compound this quarrel <eos> GRUMIO : Nay 'tis no matter sir what he 'leges in Latin <eos> if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir : well was it fit for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught I see two and thirty a pip out <eos> Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first Then had not Grumio come by the worst <eos> PETRUCHIO : A senseless villain <eos> Good Hortensio I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it <eos> GRUMIO : Knock at the gate <eos> O heavens <eos> Spake you not these words plain 'Sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly' <eos> And come you now with 'knocking at the gate' <eos> PETRUCHIO : Sirrah be gone or talk not I advise you <eos> HORTENSIO : Petruchio patience I am Grumio's pledge : Why this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio <eos> And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona <eos> PETRUCHIO : Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home Where small experience grows <eos> But in a few Signior Hortensio thus it stands with me : Antonio my father is deceased And I have thrust myself into this maze Haply to wive and thrive as best I may : Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home And so am come abroad to see the world <eos> HORTENSIO : Petruchio shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife <eos> Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel : And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich And very rich : but thou'rt too much my friend And I'll not wish thee to her <eos> PETRUCHIO : Signior Hortensio 'twixt such friends as we Few words suffice and therefore if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife As wealth is burden of my wooing dance Be she as foul as was Florentius' love As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse She moves me not or not removes at least Affection's edge in me were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas : I come to wive it wealthily in Padua If wealthily then happily in Padua <eos> GRUMIO : Nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is : Why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses : why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal <eos> HORTENSIO : Petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in I will continue that I broach'd in jest <eos> I can Petruchio help thee to a wife With wealth enough and young and beauteous Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman : Her only fault and that is faults enough Is that she is intolerable curst And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure That were my state far worser than it is I would not wed her for a mine of gold <eos> PETRUCHIO : Hortensio peace <eos> thou know'st not gold's effect : Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough For I will board her though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack <eos> HORTENSIO : Her father is Baptista Minola An affable and courteous gentleman : Her name is Katharina Minola Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue <eos> PETRUCHIO : I know her father though I know not her And he knew my deceased father well <eos> I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter Unless you will accompany me thither <eos> GRUMIO : I pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts <eos> O' my word an she knew him as well as I do she would think scolding would do little good upon him : she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so : why that's nothing an he begin once he'll rail in his rope-tricks <eos> I'll tell you what sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat <eos> You know him not sir <eos> HORTENSIO : Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee For in Baptista's keep my treasure is : He hath the jewel of my life in hold His youngest daughter beautiful Binaca And her withholds from me and other more Suitors to her and rivals in my love Supposing it a thing impossible For those defects I have before rehearsed That ever Katharina will be woo'd Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katharina the curst have got a husband <eos> GRUMIO : Katharina the curst <eos> A title for a maid of all titles the worst <eos> HORTENSIO : Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music to instruct Bianca That so I may by this device at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her And unsuspected court her by herself <eos> GRUMIO : Here's no knavery <eos> See to beguile the old folks how the young folks lay their heads together <eos> Master master look about you : who goes there ha <eos> HORTENSIO : Peace Grumio <eos> it is the rival of my love <eos> Petruchio stand by a while <eos> GRUMIO : A proper stripling and an amorous <eos> GREMIO : O very well I have perused the note <eos> Hark you sir : I'll have them very fairly bound : All books of love see that at any hand And see you read no other lectures to her : You understand me : over and beside Signior Baptista's liberality I'll mend it with a largess <eos> Take your paper too And let me have them very well perfumed For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to <eos> What will you read to her <eos> LUCENTIO : Whate'er I read to her I'll plead for you As for my patron stand you so assured As firmly as yourself were still in place : Yea and perhaps with more successful words Than you unless you were a scholar sir <eos> GREMIO : O this learning what a thing it is <eos> GRUMIO : O this woodcock what an ass it is <eos> PETRUCHIO : Peace sirrah <eos> HORTENSIO : Grumio mum <eos> God save you Signior Gremio <eos> GREMIO : And you are well met Signior Hortensio <eos> Trow you whither I am going <eos> To Baptista Minola <eos> I promised to inquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca : And by good fortune I have lighted well On this young man for learning and behavior Fit for her turn well read in poetry And other books good ones I warrant ye <eos> HORTENSIO : 'Tis well and I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another A fine musician to instruct our mistress So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca so beloved of me <eos> GREMIO : Beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove <eos> GRUMIO : And that his bags shall prove <eos> HORTENSIO : Gremio 'tis now no time to vent our love : Listen to me and if you speak me fair I'll tell you news indifferent good for either <eos> Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met Upon agreement from us to his liking Will undertake to woo curst Katharina Yea and to marry her if her dowry please <eos> GREMIO : So said so done is well <eos> Hortensio have you told him all her faults <eos> PETRUCHIO : I know she is an irksome brawling scold : If that be all masters I hear no harm <eos> GREMIO : No say'st me so friend <eos> What countryman <eos> PETRUCHIO : Born in Verona old Antonio's son : My father dead my fortune lives for me And I do hope good days and long to see <eos> GREMIO : O sir such a life with such a wife were strange <eos> But if you have a stomach to't i' God's name : You shall have me assisting you in all <eos> But will you woo this wild-cat <eos> PETRUCHIO : Will I live <eos> GRUMIO : Will he woo her <eos> ay or I'll hang her <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why came I hither but to that intent <eos> Think you a little din can daunt mine ears <eos> Have I not in my time heard lions roar <eos> Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat <eos> Have I not heard great ordnance in the field And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies <eos> Have I not in a pitched battle heard Loud 'larums neighing steeds and trumpets' clang <eos> And do you tell me of a woman's tongue That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire <eos> Tush tush <eos> fear boys with bugs <eos> GRUMIO : For he fears none <eos> GREMIO : Hortensio hark : This gentleman is happily arrived My mind presumes for his own good and ours <eos> HORTENSIO : I promised we would be contributors And bear his charging of wooing whatsoe'er <eos> GREMIO : And so we will provided that he win her <eos> GRUMIO : I would I were as sure of a good dinner <eos> TRANIO : Gentlemen God save you <eos> If I may be bold Tell me I beseech you which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola <eos> BIONDELLO : He that has the two fair daughters : is't he you mean <eos> TRANIO : Even he Biondello <eos> GREMIO : Hark you sir you mean not her to <eos> TRANIO : Perhaps him and her sir : what have you to do <eos> PETRUCHIO : Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray <eos> TRANIO : I love no chiders sir <eos> Biondello let's away <eos> LUCENTIO : Well begun Tranio <eos> HORTENSIO : Sir a word ere you go Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no <eos> TRANIO : And if I be sir is it any offence <eos> GREMIO : No if without more words you will get you hence <eos> TRANIO : Why sir I pray are not the streets as free For me as for you <eos> GREMIO : But so is not she <eos> TRANIO : For what reason I beseech you <eos> GREMIO : For this reason if you'll know That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio <eos> HORTENSIO : That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio <eos> TRANIO : Softly my masters <eos> if you be gentlemen Do me this right hear me with patience <eos> Baptista is a noble gentleman To whom my father is not all unknown And were his daughter fairer than she is She may more suitors have and me for one <eos> Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers Then well one more may fair Bianca have : And so she shall Lucentio shall make one Though Paris came in hope to speed alone <eos> GREMIO : What <eos> this gentleman will out-talk us all <eos> LUCENTIO : Sir give him head : I know he'll prove a jade <eos> PETRUCHIO : Hortensio to what end are all these words <eos> HORTENSIO : Sir let me be so bold as ask you Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter <eos> TRANIO : No sir but hear I do that he hath two The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty <eos> PETRUCHIO : Sir sir the first's for me let her go by <eos> GREMIO : Yea leave that labour to great Hercules And let it be more than Alcides' twelve <eos> PETRUCHIO : Sir understand you this of me in sooth : The youngest daughter whom you hearken for Her father keeps from all access of suitors And will not promise her to any man Until the elder sister first be wed : The younger then is free and not before <eos> TRANIO : If it be so sir that you are the man Must stead us all and me amongst the rest And if you break the ice and do this feat Achieve the elder set the younger free For our access whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate <eos> HORTENSIO : Sir you say well and well you do conceive And since you do profess to be a suitor You must as we do gratify this gentleman To whom we all rest generally beholding <eos> TRANIO : Sir I shall not be slack : in sign whereof Please ye we may contrive this afternoon And quaff carouses to our mistress' health And do as adversaries do in law Strive mightily but eat and drink as friends <eos> GRUMIO : O excellent motion <eos> Fellows let's be gone <eos> HORTENSIO : The motion's good indeed and be it so Petruchio I shall be your ben venuto <eos> BIANCA : Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself To make a bondmaid and a slave of me That I disdain : but for these other gawds Unbind my hands I'll pull them off myself Yea all my raiment to my petticoat Or what you will command me will I do So well I know my duty to my elders <eos> KATHARINA : Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell Whom thou lovest best : see thou dissemble not <eos> BIANCA : Believe me sister of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other <eos> KATHARINA : Minion thou liest <eos> Is't not Hortensio <eos> BIANCA : If you affect him sister here I swear I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him <eos> KATHARINA : O then belike you fancy riches more : You will have Gremio to keep you fair <eos> BIANCA : Is it for him you do envy me so <eos> Nay then you jest and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while : I prithee sister Kate untie my hands <eos> KATHARINA : If that be jest then all the rest was so <eos> BAPTISTA : Why how now dame <eos> whence grows this insolence <eos> Bianca stand aside <eos> Poor girl <eos> she weeps <eos> Go ply thy needle meddle not with her <eos> For shame thou helding of a devilish spirit Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee <eos> When did she cross thee with a bitter word <eos> KATHARINA : Her silence flouts me and I'll be revenged <eos> BAPTISTA : What in my sight <eos> Bianca get thee in <eos> KATHARINA : What will you not suffer me <eos> Nay now I see She is your treasure she must have a husband I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day And for your love to her lead apes in hell <eos> Talk not to me : I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge <eos> BAPTISTA : Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I <eos> But who comes here <eos> GREMIO : Good morrow neighbour Baptista <eos> BAPTISTA : Good morrow neighbour Gremio <eos> God save you gentlemen <eos> PETRUCHIO : And you good sir <eos> Pray have you not a daughter Call'd Katharina fair and virtuous <eos> BAPTISTA : I have a daughter sir called Katharina <eos> GREMIO : You are too blunt : go to it orderly <eos> PETRUCHIO : You wrong me Signior Gremio : give me leave <eos> I am a gentleman of Verona sir That hearing of her beauty and her wit Her affability and bashful modesty Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard <eos> And for an entrance to my entertainment I do present you with a man of mine Cunning in music and the mathematics To instruct her fully in those sciences Whereof I know she is not ignorant : Accept of him or else you do me wrong : His name is Licio born in Mantua <eos> BAPTISTA : You're welcome sir and he for your good sake <eos> But for my daughter Katharina this I know She is not for your turn the more my grief <eos> PETRUCHIO : I see you do not mean to part with her Or else you like not of my company <eos> BAPTISTA : Mistake me not I speak but as I find <eos> Whence are you sir <eos> what may I call your name <eos> PETRUCHIO : Petruchio is my name Antonio's son A man well known throughout all Italy <eos> BAPTISTA : I know him well : you are welcome for his sake <eos> GREMIO : Saving your tale Petruchio I pray Let us that are poor petitioners speak too : Baccare <eos> you are marvellous forward <eos> PETRUCHIO : O pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing <eos> GREMIO : I doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing <eos> Neighbour this is a gift very grateful I am sure of it <eos> To express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar that hath been long studying at Rheims as cunning in Greek Latin and other languages as the other in music and mathematics : his name is Cambio pray accept his service <eos> BAPTISTA : A thousand thanks Signior Gremio <eos> Welcome good Cambio <eos> But gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger : may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming <eos> TRANIO : Pardon me sir the boldness is mine own That being a stranger in this city here Do make myself a suitor to your daughter Unto Bianca fair and virtuous <eos> Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me In the preferment of the eldest sister <eos> This liberty is all that I request That upon knowledge of my parentage I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo And free access and favour as the rest : And toward the education of your daughters I here bestow a simple instrument And this small packet of Greek and Latin books : If you accept them then their worth is great <eos> BAPTISTA : Lucentio is your name of whence I pray <eos> TRANIO : Of Pisa sir son to Vincentio <eos> BAPTISTA : A mighty man of Pisa by report I know him well : you are very welcome sir Take you the lute and you the set of books You shall go see your pupils presently <eos> Holla within <eos> Sirrah lead these gentlemen To my daughters and tell them both These are their tutors : bid them use them well <eos> We will go walk a little in the orchard And then to dinner <eos> You are passing welcome And so I pray you all to think yourselves <eos> PETRUCHIO : Signior Baptista my business asketh haste And every day I cannot come to woo <eos> You knew my father well and in him me Left solely heir to all his lands and goods Which I have better'd rather than decreased : Then tell me if I get your daughter's love What dowry shall I have with her to wife <eos> BAPTISTA : After my death the one half of my lands And in possession twenty thousand crowns <eos> PETRUCHIO : And for that dowry I'll assure her of Her widowhood be it that she survive me In all my lands and leases whatsoever : Let specialties be therefore drawn between us That covenants may be kept on either hand <eos> BAPTISTA : Ay when the special thing is well obtain'd That is her love for that is all in all <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why that is nothing : for I tell you father I am as peremptory as she proud-minded And where two raging fires meet together They do consume the thing that feeds their fury : Though little fire grows great with little wind Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all : So I to her and so she yields to me For I am rough and woo not like a babe <eos> BAPTISTA : Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed <eos> But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words <eos> PETRUCHIO : Ay to the proof as mountains are for winds That shake not though they blow perpetually <eos> BAPTISTA : How now my friend <eos> why dost thou look so pale <eos> HORTENSIO : For fear I promise you if I look pale <eos> BAPTISTA : What will my daughter prove a good musician <eos> HORTENSIO : I think she'll sooner prove a soldier Iron may hold with her but never lutes <eos> BAPTISTA : Why then thou canst not break her to the lute <eos> HORTENSIO : Why no for she hath broke the lute to me <eos> I did but tell her she mistook her frets And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering When with a most impatient devilish spirit 'Frets call you these <eos>' quoth she 'I'll fume with them :' And with that word she struck me on the head And through the instrument my pate made way And there I stood amazed for a while As on a pillory looking through the lute While she did call me rascal fiddler And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms As had she studied to misuse me so <eos> PETRUCHIO : Now by the world it is a lusty wench I love her ten times more than e'er I did : O how I long to have some chat with her <eos> BAPTISTA : Well go with me and be not so discomfited : Proceed in practise with my younger daughter She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns <eos> Signior Petruchio will you go with us Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you <eos> PETRUCHIO : I pray you do <eos> I will attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes <eos> Say that she rail why then I'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale : Say that she frown I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly wash'd with dew : Say she be mute and will not speak a word Then I'll commend her volubility And say she uttereth piercing eloquence : If she do bid me pack I'll give her thanks As though she bid me stay by her a week : If she deny to wed I'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be married <eos> But here she comes and now Petruchio speak <eos> Good morrow Kate for that's your name I hear <eos> KATHARINA : Well have you heard but something hard of hearing : They call me Katharina that do talk of me <eos> PETRUCHIO : You lie in faith for you are call'd plain Kate And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst But Kate the prettiest Kate in Christendom Kate of Kate Hall my super-dainty Kate For dainties are all Kates and therefore Kate Take this of me Kate of my consolation Hearing thy mildness praised in every town Thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife <eos> KATHARINA : Moved <eos> in good time : let him that moved you hither Remove you hence : I knew you at the first You were a moveable <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why what's a moveable <eos> KATHARINA : A join'd-stool <eos> PETRUCHIO : Thou hast hit it : come sit on me <eos> KATHARINA : Asses are made to bear and so are you <eos> PETRUCHIO : Women are made to bear and so are you <eos> KATHARINA : No such jade as you if me you mean <eos> PETRUCHIO : Alas <eos> good Kate I will not burden thee For knowing thee to be but young and light <eos> KATHARINA : Too light for such a swain as you to catch And yet as heavy as my weight should be <eos> PETRUCHIO : Should be <eos> should <eos>buzz <eos> KATHARINA : Well ta'en and like a buzzard <eos> PETRUCHIO : O slow-wing'd turtle <eos> shall a buzzard take thee <eos> KATHARINA : Ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard <eos> PETRUCHIO : Come come you wasp i' faith you are too angry <eos> KATHARINA : If I be waspish best beware my sting <eos> PETRUCHIO : My remedy is then to pluck it out <eos> KATHARINA : Ay if the fool could find it where it lies PETRUCHIO : Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting <eos> In his tail <eos> KATHARINA : In his tongue <eos> PETRUCHIO : Whose tongue <eos> KATHARINA : Yours if you talk of tails : and so farewell <eos> PETRUCHIO : What with my tongue in your tail <eos> nay come again Good Kate I am a gentleman <eos> KATHARINA : That I'll try <eos> PETRUCHIO : I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again <eos> KATHARINA : So may you lose your arms : If you strike me you are no gentleman And if no gentleman why then no arms <eos> PETRUCHIO : A herald Kate <eos> O put me in thy books <eos> KATHARINA : What is your crest <eos> a coxcomb <eos> PETRUCHIO : A combless cock so Kate will be my hen <eos> KATHARINA : No cock of mine you crow too like a craven <eos> PETRUCHIO : Nay come Kate come you must not look so sour <eos> KATHARINA : It is my fashion when I see a crab <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why here's no crab and therefore look not sour <eos> KATHARINA : There is there is <eos> PETRUCHIO : Then show it me <eos> KATHARINA : Had I a glass I would <eos> PETRUCHIO : What you mean my face <eos> KATHARINA : Well aim'd of such a young one <eos> PETRUCHIO : Now by Saint George I am too young for you <eos> KATHARINA : Yet you are wither'd <eos> PETRUCHIO : 'Tis with cares <eos> KATHARINA : I care not <eos> PETRUCHIO : Nay hear you Kate : in sooth you scape not so <eos> KATHARINA : I chafe you if I tarry : let me go <eos> PETRUCHIO : No not a whit : I find you passing gentle <eos> 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen And now I find report a very liar For thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous But slow in speech yet sweet as spring-time flowers : Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers With gentle conference soft and affable <eos> Why does the world report that Kate doth limp <eos> O slanderous world <eos> Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels <eos> O let me see thee walk : thou dost not halt <eos> KATHARINA : Go fool and whom thou keep'st command <eos> PETRUCHIO : Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait <eos> O be thou Dian and let her be Kate And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful <eos> KATHARINA : Where did you study all this goodly speech <eos> PETRUCHIO : It is extempore from my mother-wit <eos> KATHARINA : A witty mother <eos> witless else her son <eos> PETRUCHIO : Am I not wise <eos> KATHARINA : Yes keep you warm <eos> PETRUCHIO : Marry so I mean sweet Katharina in thy bed : And therefore setting all this chat aside Thus in plain terms : your father hath consented That you shall be my wife your dowry 'greed on And Will you nill you I will marry you <eos> Now Kate I am a husband for your turn For by this light whereby I see thy beauty Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well Thou must be married to no man but me For I am he am born to tame you Kate And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates <eos> Here comes your father : never make denial I must and will have Katharina to my wife <eos> BAPTISTA : Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter <eos> PETRUCHIO : How but well sir <eos> how but well <eos> It were impossible I should speed amiss <eos> BAPTISTA : Why how now daughter Katharina <eos> in your dumps <eos> KATHARINA : Call you me daughter <eos> now I promise you You have show'd a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack That thinks with oaths to face the matter out <eos> PETRUCHIO : Father 'tis thus : yourself and all the world That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her : If she be curst it is for policy For she's not froward but modest as the dove She is not hot but temperate as the morn For patience she will prove a second Grissel And Roman Lucrece for her chastity : And to conclude we have 'greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding-day <eos> KATHARINA : I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first <eos> GREMIO : Hark Petruchio she says she'll see thee hang'd first <eos> TRANIO : Is this your speeding <eos> nay then good night our part <eos> PETRUCHIO : Be patient gentlemen I choose her for myself : If she and I be pleased what's that to you <eos> 'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain being alone That she shall still be curst in company <eos> I tell you 'tis incredible to believe How much she loves me : O the kindest Kate <eos> She hung about my neck and kiss on kiss She vied so fast protesting oath on oath That in a twink she won me to her love <eos> O you are novices <eos> 'tis a world to see How tame when men and women are alone A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew <eos> Give me thy hand Kate : I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day <eos> Provide the feast father and bid the guests I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine <eos> BAPTISTA : I know not what to say : but give me your hands God send you joy Petruchio <eos> 'tis a match <eos> GREMIO : Amen say we : we will be witnesses <eos> PETRUCHIO : Father and wife and gentlemen adieu I will to Venice Sunday comes apace : We will have rings and things and fine array And kiss me Kate we will be married o'Sunday <eos> GREMIO : Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly <eos> BAPTISTA : Faith gentlemen now I play a merchant's part And venture madly on a desperate mart <eos> TRANIO : 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you : 'Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas <eos> BAPTISTA : The gain I seek is quiet in the match <eos> GREMIO : No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch <eos> But now Baptists to your younger daughter : Now is the day we long have looked for : I am your neighbour and was suitor first <eos> TRANIO : And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess <eos> GREMIO : Youngling thou canst not love so dear as I <eos> TRANIO : Graybeard thy love doth freeze <eos> GREMIO : But thine doth fry <eos> Skipper stand back : 'tis age that nourisheth <eos> TRANIO : But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth <eos> BAPTISTA : Content you gentlemen : I will compound this strife : 'Tis deeds must win the prize and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca's love <eos> Say Signior Gremio What can you assure her <eos> GREMIO : First as you know my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns In cypress chests my arras counterpoints Costly apparel tents and canopies Fine linen Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl Valance of Venice gold in needlework Pewter and brass and all things that belong To house or housekeeping : then at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls And all things answerable to this portion <eos> Myself am struck in years I must confess And if I die to-morrow this is hers If whilst I live she will be only mine <eos> TRANIO : That 'only' came well in <eos> Sir list to me : I am my father's heir and only son : If I may have your daughter to my wife I'll leave her houses three or four as good Within rich Pisa walls as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua Besides two thousand ducats by the year Of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure <eos> What have I pinch'd you Signior Gremio <eos> GREMIO : Two thousand ducats by the year of land <eos> My land amounts not to so much in all : That she shall have besides an argosy That now is lying in Marseilles' road <eos> What have I choked you with an argosy <eos> TRANIO : Gremio 'tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies besides two galliases And twelve tight galleys : these I will assure her And twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next <eos> GREMIO : Nay I have offer'd all I have no more And she can have no more than all I have : If you like me she shall have me and mine <eos> TRANIO : Why then the maid is mine from all the world By your firm promise : Gremio is out-vied <eos> BAPTISTA : I must confess your offer is the best And let your father make her the assurance She is your own else you must pardon me if you should die before him where's her dower <eos> TRANIO : That's but a cavil : he is old I young <eos> GREMIO : And may not young men die as well as old <eos> BAPTISTA : Well gentlemen I am thus resolved : on Sunday next you know My daughter Katharina is to be married : Now on the Sunday following shall Bianca Be bride to you if you this assurance If not Signior Gremio : And so I take my leave and thank you both <eos> GREMIO : Adieu good neighbour <eos> Now I fear thee not : Sirrah young gamester your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table : tut a toy <eos> An old Italian fox is not so kind my boy <eos> TRANIO : A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide <eos> Yet I have faced it with a card of ten <eos> 'Tis in my head to do my master good : I see no reason but supposed Lucentio Must get a father call'd 'supposed Vincentio' And that's a wonder : fathers commonly Do get their children but in this case of wooing A child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning <eos> LUCENTIO : Fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir : Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal <eos> HORTENSIO : But wrangling pedant this is The patroness of heavenly harmony : Then give me leave to have prerogative And when in music we have spent an hour Your lecture shall have leisure for as much <eos> LUCENTIO : Preposterous ass that never read so far To know the cause why music was ordain'd <eos> Was it not to refresh the mind of man After his studies or his usual pain <eos> Then give me leave to read philosophy And while I pause serve in your harmony <eos> HORTENSIO : Sirrah I will not bear these braves of thine <eos> BIANCA : Why gentlemen you do me double wrong To strive for that which resteth in my choice : I am no breeching scholar in the schools I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times But learn my lessons as I please myself <eos> And to cut off all strife here sit we down : Take you your instrument play you the whiles His lecture will be done ere you have tuned <eos> HORTENSIO : You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune <eos> LUCENTIO : That will be never : tune your instrument <eos> BIANCA : Where left we last <eos> LUCENTIO : Here madam : 'Hic ibat Simois hic est Sigeia tellus Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis <eos>' BIANCA : Construe them <eos> LUCENTIO : 'Hic ibat' as I told you before 'Simois' I am Lucentio 'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa 'Sigeia tellus' disguised thus to get your love 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing 'Priami' is my man Tranio 'regia' bearing my port 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon <eos> HORTENSIO : Madam my instrument's in tune <eos> BIANCA : Let's hear <eos> O fie <eos> the treble jars <eos> LUCENTIO : Spit in the hole man and tune again <eos> BIANCA : Now let me see if I can construe it : 'Hic ibat Simois' I know you not 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I trust you not 'Hic steterat Priami' take heed he hear us not 'regia' presume not 'celsa senis' despair not <eos> HORTENSIO : Madam 'tis now in tune <eos> LUCENTIO : All but the base <eos> HORTENSIO : The base is right 'tis the base knave that jars <eos> How fiery and forward our pedant is <eos> Now for my life the knave doth court my love : Pedascule I'll watch you better yet <eos> BIANCA : In time I may believe yet I mistrust <eos> LUCENTIO : Mistrust it not : for sure AEacides Was Ajax call'd so from his grandfather <eos> BIANCA : I must believe my master else I promise you I should be arguing still upon that doubt : But let it rest <eos> Now Licio to you : Good masters take it not unkindly pray That I have been thus pleasant with you both <eos> HORTENSIO : You may go walk and give me leave a while : My lessons make no music in three parts <eos> LUCENTIO : Are you so formal sir <eos> well I must wait And watch withal for but I be deceived Our fine musician groweth amorous <eos> HORTENSIO : Madam before you touch the instrument To learn the order of my fingering I must begin with rudiments of art To teach you gamut in a briefer sort More pleasant pithy and effectual Than hath been taught by any of my trade : And there it is in writing fairly drawn <eos> BIANCA : Why I am past my gamut long ago <eos> HORTENSIO : Yet read the gamut of Hortensio <eos> BIANCA : Servant : Mistress your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister's chamber up : You know to-morrow is the wedding-day <eos> BIANCA : Farewell sweet masters both I must be gone <eos> LUCENTIO : Faith mistress then I have no cause to stay <eos> HORTENSIO : But I have cause to pry into this pedant : Methinks he looks as though he were in love : Yet if thy thoughts Bianca be so humble To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale Seize thee that list : if once I find thee ranging Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing <eos> BAPTISTA : KATHARINA : No shame but mine : I must forsooth be forced To give my hand opposed against my heart Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure <eos> I told you I he was a frantic fool Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior : And to be noted for a merry man He'll woo a thousand 'point the day of marriage Make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd <eos> Now must the world point at poor Katharina And say 'Lo there is mad Petruchio's wife If it would please him come and marry her <eos>' TRANIO : Patience good Katharina and Baptista too <eos> Upon my life Petruchio means but well Whatever fortune stays him from his word : Though he be blunt I know him passing wise Though he be merry yet withal he's honest <eos> KATHARINA : Would Katharina had never seen him though <eos> BAPTISTA : Go girl I cannot blame thee now to weep For such an injury would vex a very saint Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour <eos> BIONDELLO : Master master <eos> news old news and such news as you never heard of <eos> BAPTISTA : Is it new and old too <eos> how may that be <eos> BIONDELLO : Why is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming <eos> BAPTISTA : Is he come <eos> BIONDELLO : Why no sir <eos> BAPTISTA : What then <eos> BIONDELLO : He is coming <eos> BAPTISTA : When will he be here <eos> BIONDELLO : When he stands where I am and sees you there <eos> TRANIO : But say what to thine old news <eos> BIONDELLO : Why Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair of boots that have been candle-cases one buckled another laced an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town-armory with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points : his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten near-legged before and with a half-chequed bit and a head-stall of sheeps leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthread <eos> BAPTISTA : Who comes with him <eos> BIONDELLO : O sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and 'the humour of forty fancies' pricked in't for a feather : a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey <eos> TRANIO : 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd <eos> BAPTISTA : I am glad he's come howsoe'er he comes <eos> BIONDELLO : Why sir he comes not <eos> BAPTISTA : Didst thou not say he comes <eos> BIONDELLO : Who <eos> that Petruchio came <eos> BAPTISTA : Ay that Petruchio came <eos> BIONDELLO : No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back <eos> BAPTISTA : Why that's all one <eos> BIONDELLO : Nay by Saint Jamy I hold you a penny A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many <eos> PETRUCHIO : Come where be these gallants <eos> who's at home <eos> BAPTISTA : You are welcome sir <eos> PETRUCHIO : And yet I come not well <eos> BAPTISTA : And yet you halt not <eos> TRANIO : Not so well apparell'd As I wish you were <eos> PETRUCHIO : Were it better I should rush in thus <eos> But where is Kate <eos> where is my lovely bride <eos> How does my father <eos> Gentles methinks you frown : And wherefore gaze this goodly company As if they saw some wondrous monument Some comet or unusual prodigy <eos> BAPTISTA : Why sir you know this is your wedding-day : First were we sad fearing you would not come Now sadder that you come so unprovided <eos> Fie doff this habit shame to your estate An eye-sore to our solemn festival <eos> TRANIO : And tells us what occasion of import Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife And sent you hither so unlike yourself <eos> PETRUCHIO : Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear : Sufficeth I am come to keep my word Though in some part enforced to digress Which at more leisure I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal <eos> But where is Kate <eos> I stay too long from her : The morning wears 'tis time we were at church <eos> TRANIO : See not your bride in these unreverent robes : Go to my chamber Put on clothes of mine <eos> PETRUCHIO : Not I believe me : thus I'll visit her <eos> BAPTISTA : But thus I trust you will not marry her <eos> PETRUCHIO : Good sooth even thus therefore ha' done with words : To me she's married not unto my clothes : Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself <eos> But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss <eos> TRANIO : He hath some meaning in his mad attire : We will persuade him be it possible To put on better ere he go to church <eos> BAPTISTA : I'll after him and see the event of this <eos> TRANIO : But to her love concerneth us to add Her father's liking : which to bring to pass As I before unparted to your worship I am to get a man <eos>whate'er he be It skills not much <eos> we'll fit him to our turn <eos> And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa And make assurance here in Padua Of greater sums than I have promised <eos> So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent <eos> LUCENTIO : Were it not that my fellow-school-master Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly 'Twere good methinks to steal our marriage Which once perform'd let all the world say no I'll keep mine own despite of all the world <eos> TRANIO : That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business : We'll over-reach the greybeard Gremio The narrow-prying father Minola The quaint musician amorous Licio All for my master's sake Lucentio <eos> Signior Gremio came you from the church <eos> GREMIO : As willingly as e'er I came from school <eos> TRANIO : And is the bride and bridegroom coming home <eos> GREMIO : A bridegroom say you <eos> 'tis a groom indeed A grumbling groom and that the girl shall find <eos> TRANIO : Curster than she <eos> why 'tis impossible <eos> GREMIO : Why he's a devil a devil a very fiend <eos> TRANIO : Why she's a devil a devil the devil's dam <eos> GREMIO : Tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him <eos> I'll tell you Sir Lucentio : when the priest Should ask if Katharina should be his wife 'Ay by gogs-wouns' quoth he and swore so loud That all-amazed the priest let fall the book And as he stoop'd again to take it up The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book and book and priest : 'Now take them up' quoth he 'if any list <eos>' TRANIO : What said the wench when he rose again <eos> GREMIO : Trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him <eos> But after many ceremonies done He calls for wine : 'A health <eos>' quoth he as if He had been aboard carousing to his mates After a storm quaff'd off the muscadel And threw the sops all in the sexton's face Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking <eos> This done he took the bride about the neck And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo : And I seeing this came thence for very shame And after me I know the rout is coming <eos> Such a mad marriage never was before : Hark hark <eos> I hear the minstrels play <eos> PETRUCHIO : Gentlemen and friends I thank you for your pains : I know you think to dine with me to-day And have prepared great store of wedding cheer But so it is my haste doth call me hence And therefore here I mean to take my leave <eos> BAPTISTA : Is't possible you will away to-night <eos> PETRUCHIO : I must away to-day before night come : Make it no wonder if you knew my business You would entreat me rather go than stay <eos> And honest company I thank you all That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient sweet and virtuous wife : Dine with my father drink a health to me For I must hence and farewell to you all <eos> TRANIO : Let us entreat you stay till after dinner <eos> PETRUCHIO : It may not be <eos> GREMIO : Let me entreat you <eos> PETRUCHIO : It cannot be <eos> KATHARINA : Let me entreat you <eos> PETRUCHIO : I am content <eos> KATHARINA : Are you content to stay <eos> PETRUCHIO : I am content you shall entreat me stay But yet not stay entreat me how you can <eos> KATHARINA : Now if you love me stay <eos> PETRUCHIO : Grumio my horse <eos> GRUMIO : Ay sir they be ready : the oats have eaten the horses <eos> KATHARINA : Nay then Do what thou canst I will not go to-day No nor to-morrow not till I please myself <eos> The door is open sir there lies your way You may be jogging whiles your boots are green For me I'll not be gone till I please myself : 'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom That take it on you at the first so roundly <eos> PETRUCHIO : O Kate content thee prithee be not angry <eos> KATHARINA : I will be angry : what hast thou to do <eos> Father be quiet he shall stay my leisure <eos> GREMIO : Ay marry sir now it begins to work <eos> KATARINA : Gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner : I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist <eos> PETRUCHIO : They shall go forward Kate at thy command <eos> Obey the bride you that attend on her Go to the feast revel and domineer Carouse full measure to her maidenhead Be mad and merry or go hang yourselves : But for my bonny Kate she must with me <eos> Nay look not big nor stamp nor stare nor fret I will be master of what is mine own : She is my goods my chattels she is my house My household stuff my field my barn My horse my ox my ass my any thing And here she stands touch her whoever dare I'll bring mine action on the proudest he That stops my way in Padua <eos> Grumio Draw forth thy weapon we are beset with thieves Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man <eos> Fear not sweet wench they shall not touch thee Kate : I'll buckler thee against a million <eos> BAPTISTA : Nay let them go a couple of quiet ones <eos> GREMIO : Went they not quickly I should die with laughing <eos> TRANIO : Of all mad matches never was the like <eos> LUCENTIO : Mistress what's your opinion of your sister <eos> BIANCA : That being mad herself she's madly mated <eos> GREMIO : I warrant him Petruchio is Kated <eos> BAPTISTA : Neighbours and friends though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table You know there wants no junkets at the feast <eos> Lucentio you shall supply the bridegroom's place : And let Bianca take her sister's room <eos> TRANIO : Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it <eos> BAPTISTA : She shall Lucentio <eos> Come gentlemen let's go <eos> GRUMIO : Fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and all foul ways <eos> Was ever man so beaten <eos> was ever man so rayed <eos> was ever man so weary <eos> I am sent before to make a fire and they are coming after to warm them <eos> Now were not I a little pot and soon hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my belly ere I should come by a fire to thaw me : but I with blowing the fire shall warm myself for considering the weather a taller man than I will take cold <eos> Holla ho <eos> Curtis <eos> CURTIS : Who is that calls so coldly <eos> GRUMIO : A piece of ice : if thou doubt it thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck <eos> A fire good Curtis <eos> CURTIS : Is my master and his wife coming Grumio <eos> GRUMIO : O ay Curtis ay : and therefore fire fire cast on no water <eos> CURTIS : Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported <eos> GRUMIO : She was good Curtis before this frost : but thou knowest winter tames man woman and beast for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself fellow Curtis <eos> CURTIS : Away you three-inch fool <eos> I am no beast <eos> GRUMIO : Am I but three inches <eos> why thy horn is a foot and so long am I at the least <eos> But wilt thou make a fire or shall I complain on thee to our mistress whose hand she being now at hand thou shalt soon feel to thy cold comfort for being slow in thy hot office <eos> CURTIS : I prithee good Grumio tell me how goes the world <eos> GRUMIO : A cold world Curtis in every office but thine and therefore fire : do thy duty and have thy duty for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death <eos> CURTIS : There's fire ready and therefore good Grumio the news <eos> GRUMIO : Why 'Jack boy <eos> ho <eos> boy <eos>' and as much news as will thaw <eos> CURTIS : Come you are so full of cony-catching <eos> GRUMIO : Why therefore fire for I have caught extreme cold <eos> Where's the cook <eos> is supper ready the house trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept the serving-men in their new fustian their white stockings and every officer his wedding-garment on <eos> Be the jacks fair within the jills fair without the carpets laid and every thing in order <eos> CURTIS : All ready and therefore I pray thee news <eos> GRUMIO : First know my horse is tired my master and mistress fallen out <eos> CURTIS : How <eos> GRUMIO : Out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a tale <eos> CURTIS : Let's ha't good Grumio <eos> GRUMIO : Lend thine ear <eos> CURTIS : Here <eos> GRUMIO : There <eos> CURTIS : This is to feel a tale not to hear a tale <eos> GRUMIO : And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale : and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening <eos> Now I begin : Imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress <eos> CURTIS : Both of one horse <eos> GRUMIO : What's that to thee <eos> CURTIS : Why a horse <eos> GRUMIO : Tell thou the tale : but hadst thou not crossed me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place how she was bemoiled how he left her with the horse upon her how he beat me because her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed that never prayed before how I cried how the horses ran away how her bridle was burst how I lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion and thou return unexperienced to thy grave <eos> CURTIS : By this reckoning he is more shrew than she <eos> GRUMIO : Ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home <eos> But what talk I of this <eos> Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip Walter Sugarsop and the rest : let their heads be sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their garters of an indifferent knit : let them curtsy with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their hands <eos> Are they all ready <eos> CURTIS : They are <eos> GRUMIO : Call them forth <eos> CURTIS : Do you hear ho <eos> you must meet my master to countenance my mistress <eos> GRUMIO : Why she hath a face of her own <eos> CURTIS : Who knows not that <eos> GRUMIO : Thou it seems that calls for company to countenance her <eos> CURTIS : I call them forth to credit her <eos> GRUMIO : Why she comes to borrow nothing of them <eos> NATHANIEL : Welcome home Grumio <eos> PHILIP : How now Grumio <eos> JOSEPH : What Grumio <eos> NICHOLAS : Fellow Grumio <eos> NATHANIEL : How now old lad <eos> GRUMIO : Welcome you <eos>how now you <eos> what you <eos>fellow you <eos>and thus much for greeting <eos> Now my spruce companions is all ready and all things neat <eos> NATHANIEL : All things is ready <eos> How near is our master <eos> GRUMIO : E'en at hand alighted by this and therefore be not <eos>Cock's passion silence <eos> I hear my master <eos> PETRUCHIO : Where be these knaves <eos> What no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse <eos> Where is Nathaniel Gregory Philip <eos> ALL SERVING-MEN : Here here sir here sir <eos> PETRUCHIO : Here sir <eos> here sir <eos> here sir <eos> here sir <eos> You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms <eos> What no attendance <eos> no regard <eos> no duty <eos> Where is the foolish knave I sent before <eos> GRUMIO : Here sir as foolish as I was before <eos> PETRUCHIO : You peasant swain <eos> you whoreson malt-horse drudge <eos> Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee <eos> GRUMIO : Nathaniel's coat sir was not fully made And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel There was no link to colour Peter's hat And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing : There were none fine but Adam Ralph and Gregory The rest were ragged old and beggarly Yet as they are here are they come to meet you <eos> PETRUCHIO : Go rascals go and fetch my supper in <eos> Where is the life that late I led <eos> Where are those <eos>Sit down Kate and welcome <eos> <eos> Sound sound sound sound <eos> Why when I say <eos> Nay good sweet Kate be merry <eos> Off with my boots you rogues <eos> you villains when <eos> It was the friar of orders grey As he forth walked on his way : <eos> Out you rogue <eos> you pluck my foot awry : Take that and mend the plucking off the other <eos> Be merry Kate <eos> Some water here what ho <eos> Where's my spaniel Troilus <eos> Sirrah get you hence And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither : One Kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with <eos> Where are my slippers <eos> Shall I have some water <eos> Come Kate and wash and welcome heartily <eos> You whoreson villain <eos> will you let it fall <eos> KATHARINA : Patience I pray you 'twas a fault unwilling <eos> PETRUCHIO : A whoreson beetle-headed flap-ear'd knave <eos> Come Kate sit down I know you have a stomach <eos> Will you give thanks sweet Kate or else shall I <eos> What's this <eos> mutton <eos> First Servant : Ay <eos> PETRUCHIO : Who brought it <eos> PETER : I <eos> PETRUCHIO : 'Tis burnt and so is all the meat <eos> What dogs are these <eos> Where is the rascal cook <eos> How durst you villains bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not <eos> Theretake it to you trenchers cups and all You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves <eos> What do you grumble <eos> I'll be with you straight <eos> KATHARINA : I pray you husband be not so disquiet : The meat was well if you were so contented <eos> PETRUCHIO : I tell thee Kate 'twas burnt and dried away And I expressly am forbid to touch it For it engenders choler planteth anger And better 'twere that both of us did fast Since of ourselves ourselves are choleric Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh <eos> Be patient to-morrow 't shall be mended And for this night we'll fast for company : Come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber <eos> NATHANIEL : Peter didst ever see the like <eos> PETER : He kills her in her own humour <eos> GRUMIO : Where is he <eos> CURTIS : In her chamber making a sermon of continency to her And rails and swears and rates that she poor soul Knows not which way to stand to look to speak And sits as one new-risen from a dream <eos> Away away <eos> for he is coming hither <eos> PETRUCHIO : Thus have I politicly begun my reign And 'tis my hope to end successfully <eos> My falcon now is sharp and passing empty And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged For then she never looks upon her lure <eos> Another way I have to man my haggard To make her come and know her keeper's call That is to watch her as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient <eos> She eat no meat to-day nor none shall eat Last night she slept not nor to-night she shall not As with the meat some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed And here I'll fling the pillow there the bolster This way the coverlet another way the sheets : Ay and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her And in conclusion she shall watch all night : And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl And with the clamour keep her still awake <eos> This is a way to kill a wife with kindness And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour <eos> He that knows better how to tame a shrew Now let him speak : 'tis charity to show <eos> TRANIO : Is't possible friend Licio that Mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio <eos> I tell you sir she bears me fair in hand <eos> HORTENSIO : Sir to satisfy you in what I have said Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching <eos> LUCENTIO : Now mistress profit you in what you read <eos> BIANCA : What master read you <eos> first resolve me that <eos> LUCENTIO : I read that I profess the Art to Love <eos> BIANCA : And may you prove sir master of your art <eos> LUCENTIO : While you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart <eos> HORTENSIO : Quick proceeders marry <eos> Now tell me I pray You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio <eos> TRANIO : O despiteful love <eos> unconstant womankind <eos> I tell thee Licio this is wonderful <eos> HORTENSIO : Mistake no more : I am not Licio Nor a musician as I seem to be But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentleman And makes a god of such a cullion : Know sir that I am call'd Hortensio <eos> TRANIO : Signior Hortensio I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness I will with you if you be so contented Forswear Bianca and her love for ever <eos> HORTENSIO : See how they kiss and court <eos> Signior Lucentio Here is my hand and here I firmly vow Never to woo her no more but do forswear her As one unworthy all the former favours That I have fondly flatter'd her withal <eos> TRANIO : And here I take the unfeigned oath Never to marry with her though she would entreat : Fie on her <eos> see how beastly she doth court him <eos> HORTENSIO : Would all the world but he had quite forsworn <eos> For me that I may surely keep mine oath I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard <eos> And so farewell Signior Lucentio <eos> Kindness in women not their beauteous looks Shall win my love : and so I take my leave In resolution as I swore before <eos> TRANIO : Mistress Bianca bless you with such grace As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case <eos> Nay I have ta'en you napping gentle love And have forsworn you with Hortensio <eos> BIANCA : Tranio you jest : but have you both forsworn me <eos> TRANIO : Mistress we have <eos> LUCENTIO : Then we are rid of Licio <eos> TRANIO : I' faith he'll have a lusty widow now That shall be wood and wedded in a day <eos> BIANCA : God give him joy <eos> TRANIO : Ay and he'll tame her <eos> BIANCA : He says so Tranio <eos> TRANIO : Faith he is gone unto the taming-school <eos> BIANCA : The taming-school <eos> what is there such a place <eos> TRANIO : Ay mistress and Petruchio is the master That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue <eos> BIONDELLO : O master master I have watch'd so long That I am dog-weary : but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn <eos> TRANIO : What is he Biondello <eos> BIONDELLO : Master a mercatante or a pedant I know not what but format in apparel In gait and countenance surely like a father <eos> LUCENTIO : And what of him Tranio <eos> TRANIO : If he be credulous and trust my tale I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio And give assurance to Baptista Minola As if he were the right Vincentio Take in your love and then let me alone <eos> Pedant : God save you sir <eos> TRANIO : And you sir <eos> you are welcome <eos> Travel you far on or are you at the farthest <eos> Pedant : Sir at the farthest for a week or two : But then up farther and as for as Rome And so to Tripoli if God lend me life <eos> TRANIO : What countryman I pray <eos> Pedant : Of Mantua <eos> TRANIO : Of Mantua sir <eos> marry God forbid <eos> And come to Padua careless of your life <eos> Pedant : My life sir <eos> how I pray <eos> for that goes hard <eos> TRANIO : 'Tis death for any one in Mantua To come to Padua <eos> Know you not the cause <eos> Your ships are stay'd at Venice and the duke For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly : 'Tis marvel but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaim'd about <eos> Pedant : Alas <eos> sir it is worse for me than so For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence and must here deliver them <eos> TRANIO : Well sir to do you courtesy This will I do and this I will advise you : First tell me have you ever been at Pisa <eos> Pedant : Ay sir in Pisa have I often been Pisa renowned for grave citizens <eos> TRANIO : Among them know you one Vincentio <eos> Pedant : I know him not but I have heard of him A merchant of incomparable wealth <eos> TRANIO : He is my father sir and sooth to say In countenance somewhat doth resemble you <eos> BIONDELLO : TRANIO : To save your life in this extremity This favour will I do you for his sake And think it not the worst of an your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio <eos> His name and credit shall you undertake And in my house you shall be friendly lodged : Look that you take upon you as you should You understand me sir : so shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city : If this be courtesy sir accept of it <eos> Pedant : O sir I do and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty <eos> TRANIO : Then go with me to make the matter good <eos> This by the way I let you understand my father is here look'd for every day To pass assurance of a dower in marriage 'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here : In all these circumstances I'll instruct you : Go with me to clothe you as becomes you <eos> GRUMIO : No no forsooth I dare not for my life <eos> KATHARINA : The more my wrong the more his spite appears : What did he marry me to famish me <eos> Beggars that come unto my father's door Upon entreaty have a present aims If not elsewhere they meet with charity : But I who never knew how to entreat Nor never needed that I should entreat Am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep With oath kept waking and with brawling fed : And that which spites me more than all these wants He does it under name of perfect love As who should say if I should sleep or eat 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death <eos> I prithee go and get me some repast I care not what so it be wholesome food <eos> GRUMIO : What say you to a neat's foot <eos> KATHARINA : 'Tis passing good : I prithee let me have it <eos> GRUMIO : I fear it is too choleric a meat <eos> How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd <eos> KATHARINA : I like it well : good Grumio fetch it me <eos> GRUMIO : I cannot tell I fear 'tis choleric <eos> What say you to a piece of beef and mustard <eos> KATHARINA : A dish that I do love to feed upon <eos> GRUMIO : Ay but the mustard is too hot a little <eos> KATHARINA : Why then the beef and let the mustard rest <eos> GRUMIO : Nay then I will not : you shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio <eos> KATHARINA : Then both or one or any thing thou wilt <eos> GRUMIO : Why then the mustard without the beef <eos> KATHARINA : Go get thee gone thou false deluding slave That feed'st me with the very name of meat : Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you That triumph thus upon my misery <eos> Go get thee gone I say <eos> PETRUCHIO : How fares my Kate <eos> What sweeting all amort <eos> HORTENSIO : Mistress what cheer <eos> KATHARINA : Faith as cold as can be <eos> PETRUCHIO : Pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me <eos> Here love thou see'st how diligent I am To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee : I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks <eos> What not a word <eos> Nay then thou lovest it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof <eos> Here take away this dish <eos> KATHARINA : I pray you let it stand <eos> PETRUCHIO : The poorest service is repaid with thanks And so shall mine before you touch the meat <eos> KATHARINA : I thank you sir <eos> HORTENSIO : Signior Petruchio fie <eos> you are to blame <eos> Come mistress Kate I'll bear you company <eos> PETRUCHIO : Haberdasher : Here is the cap your worship did bespeak <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why this was moulded on a porringer A velvet dish : fie fie <eos> 'tis lewd and filthy : Why 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell A knack a toy a trick a baby's cap : Away with it <eos> come let me have a bigger <eos> KATHARINA : I'll have no bigger : this doth fit the time And gentlewomen wear such caps as these PETRUCHIO : When you are gentle you shall have one too And not till then <eos> HORTENSIO : KATHARINA : Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak And speak I will I am no child no babe : Your betters have endured me say my mind And if you cannot best you stop your ears <eos> My tongue will tell the anger of my heart Or else my heart concealing it will break And rather than it shall I will be free Even to the uttermost as I please in words <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why thou say'st true it is a paltry cap A custard-coffin a bauble a silken pie : I love thee well in that thou likest it not <eos> KATHARINA : Love me or love me not I like the cap And it I will have or I will have none <eos> PETRUCHIO : Thy gown <eos> why ay : come tailor let us see't <eos> O mercy God <eos> what masquing stuff is here <eos> What's this <eos> a sleeve <eos> 'tis like a demi-cannon : What up and down carved like an apple-tart <eos> Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash Like to a censer in a barber's shop : Why what i' devil's name tailor call'st thou this <eos> HORTENSIO : Tailor : You bid me make it orderly and well According to the fashion and the time <eos> PETRUCHIO : Marry and did but if you be remember'd I did not bid you mar it to the time <eos> Go hop me over every kennel home For you shall hop without my custom sir : I'll none of it : hence <eos> make your best of it <eos> KATHARINA : I never saw a better-fashion'd gown More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable : Belike you mean to make a puppet of me <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why true he means to make a puppet of thee <eos> Tailor : She says your worship means to make a puppet of her <eos> PETRUCHIO : O monstrous arrogance <eos> Thou liest thou thread thou thimble Thou yard three-quarters half-yard quarter nail <eos> Thou flea thou nit thou winter-cricket thou <eos> Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread <eos> Away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest <eos> I tell thee I that thou hast marr'd her gown <eos> Tailor : Your worship is deceived the gown is made Just as my master had direction : Grumio gave order how it should be done <eos> GRUMIO : I gave him no order I gave him the stuff <eos> Tailor : But how did you desire it should be made <eos> GRUMIO : Marry sir with needle and thread <eos> Tailor : But did you not request to have it cut <eos> GRUMIO : Thou hast faced many things <eos> Tailor : I have <eos> GRUMIO : Face not me : thou hast braved many men brave not me I will neither be faced nor braved <eos> I say unto thee I bid thy master cut out the gown but I did not bid him cut it to pieces : ergo thou liest <eos> Tailor : Why here is the note of the fashion to testify PETRUCHIO : Read it <eos> GRUMIO : The note lies in's throat if he say I said so <eos> Tailor : GRUMIO : Master if ever I said loose-bodied gown sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread : I said a gown <eos> PETRUCHIO : Proceed <eos> Tailor : GRUMIO : I confess the cape <eos> Tailor : GRUMIO : I confess two sleeves <eos> Tailor : PETRUCHIO : Ay there's the villany <eos> GRUMIO : Error i' the bill sir error i' the bill <eos> I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again and that I'll prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble <eos> Tailor : This is true that I say : an I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it <eos> GRUMIO : I am for thee straight : take thou the bill give me thy mete-yard and spare not me <eos> HORTENSIO : God-a-mercy Grumio <eos> then he shall have no odds <eos> PETRUCHIO : Well sir in brief the gown is not for me <eos> GRUMIO : You are i' the right sir : 'tis for my mistress <eos> PETRUCHIO : Go take it up unto thy master's use <eos> GRUMIO : Villain not for thy life : take up my mistress' gown for thy master's use <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why sir what's your conceit in that <eos> GRUMIO : O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for : Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use <eos> O fie fie fie <eos> PETRUCHIO : HORTENSIO : Tailor I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow : Take no unkindness of his hasty words : Away <eos> I say commend me to thy master <eos> PETRUCHIO : Well come my Kate we will unto your father's Even in these honest mean habiliments : Our purses shall be proud our garments poor For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds So honour peereth in the meanest habit <eos> What is the jay more precious than the lark Because his fathers are more beautiful <eos> Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye <eos> O no good Kate neither art thou the worse For this poor furniture and mean array <eos> if thou account'st it shame <eos> lay it on me And therefore frolic : we will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father's house <eos> Go call my men and let us straight to him And bring our horses unto Long-lane end There will we mount and thither walk on foot Let's see I think 'tis now some seven o'clock And well we may come there by dinner-time <eos> KATHARINA : I dare assure you sir 'tis almost two And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there <eos> PETRUCHIO : It shall be seven ere I go to horse : Look what I speak or do or think to do You are still crossing it <eos> Sirs let't alone : I will not go to-day and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is <eos> HORTENSIO : TRANIO : Sir this is the house : please it you that I call <eos> Pedant : Ay what else <eos> and but I be deceived Signior Baptista may remember me Near twenty years ago in Genoa Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus <eos> TRANIO : 'Tis well and hold your own in any case With such austerity as 'longeth to a father <eos> Pedant : I warrant you <eos> But sir here comes your boy 'Twere good he were school'd <eos> TRANIO : Fear you not him <eos> Sirrah Biondello Now do your duty throughly I advise you : Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio <eos> BIONDELLO : Tut fear not me <eos> TRANIO : But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista <eos> BIONDELLO : I told him that your father was at Venice And that you look'd for him this day in Padua <eos> TRANIO : Thou'rt a tall fellow : hold thee that to drink <eos> Here comes Baptista : set your countenance sir <eos> Signior Baptista you are happily met <eos> Sir this is the gentleman I told you of : I pray you stand good father to me now Give me Bianca for my patrimony <eos> Pedant : Soft son <eos> Sir by your leave : having come to Padua To gather in some debts my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself : And for the good report I hear of you And for the love he beareth to your daughter And she to him to stay him not too long I am content in a good father's care To have him match'd and if you please to like No worse than I upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestow'd For curious I cannot be with you Signior Baptista of whom I hear so well <eos> BAPTISTA : Sir pardon me in what I have to say : Your plainness and your shortness please me well <eos> Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him Or both dissemble deeply their affections : And therefore if you say no more than this That like a father you will deal with him And pass my daughter a sufficient dower The match is made and all is done : Your son shall have my daughter with consent <eos> TRANIO : I thank you sir <eos> Where then do you know best We be affied and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part's agreement stand <eos> BAPTISTA : Not in my house Lucentio for you know Pitchers have ears and I have many servants : Besides old Gremio is hearkening still And happily we might be interrupted <eos> TRANIO : Then at my lodging an it like you : There doth my father lie and there this night We'll pass the business privately and well <eos> Send for your daughter by your servant here : My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently <eos> The worst is this that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance <eos> BAPTISTA : It likes me well <eos> Biondello hie you home And bid Bianca make her ready straight And if you will tell what hath happened Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife <eos> BIONDELLO : I pray the gods she may with all my heart <eos> TRANIO : Dally not with the gods but get thee gone <eos> Signior Baptista shall I lead the way <eos> Welcome <eos> one mess is like to be your cheer : Come sir we will better it in Pisa <eos> BAPTISTA : I follow you <eos> BIONDELLO : Cambio <eos> LUCENTIO : What sayest thou Biondello <eos> BIONDELLO : You saw my master wink and laugh upon you <eos> LUCENTIO : Biondello what of that <eos> BIONDELLO : Faith nothing but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens <eos> LUCENTIO : I pray thee moralize them <eos> BIONDELLO : Then thus <eos> Baptista is safe talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son <eos> LUCENTIO : And what of him <eos> BIONDELLO : His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper <eos> LUCENTIO : And then <eos> BIONDELLO : The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your command at all hours <eos> LUCENTIO : And what of all this <eos> BIONDELLO : I cannot tell expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance : take you assurance of her 'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum :' to the church take the priest clerk and some sufficient honest witnesses : If this be not that you look for I have no more to say But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day <eos> LUCENTIO : Hearest thou Biondello <eos> BIONDELLO : I cannot tarry : I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir : and so adieu sir <eos> My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix <eos> LUCENTIO : I may and will if she be so contented : She will be pleased then wherefore should I doubt <eos> Hap what hap may I'll roundly go about her : It shall go hard if Cambio go without her <eos> PETRUCHIO : Come on i' God's name once more toward our father's <eos> Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon <eos> KATHARINA : The moon <eos> the sun : it is not moonlight now <eos> PETRUCHIO : I say it is the moon that shines so bright <eos> KATHARINA : I know it is the sun that shines so bright <eos> PETRUCHIO : Now by my mother's son and that's myself It shall be moon or star or what I list Or ere I journey to your father's house <eos> Go on and fetch our horses back again <eos> Evermore cross'd and cross'd nothing but cross'd <eos> HORTENSIO : Say as he says or we shall never go <eos> KATHARINA : Forward I pray since we have come so far And be it moon or sun or what you please : An if you please to call it a rush-candle Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me <eos> PETRUCHIO : I say it is the moon <eos> KATHARINA : I know it is the moon <eos> PETRUCHIO : Nay then you lie : it is the blessed sun <eos> KATHARINA : Then God be bless'd it is the blessed sun : But sun it is not when you say it is not And the moon changes even as your mind <eos> What you will have it named even that it is And so it shall be so for Katharina <eos> HORTENSIO : Petruchio go thy ways the field is won <eos> PETRUCHIO : Well forward forward <eos> thus the bowl should run And not unluckily against the bias <eos> But soft <eos> company is coming here <eos> Good morrow gentle mistress : where away <eos> Tell me sweet Kate and tell me truly too Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman <eos> Such war of white and red within her cheeks <eos> What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty As those two eyes become that heavenly face <eos> Fair lovely maid once more good day to thee <eos> Sweet Kate embrace her for her beauty's sake <eos> HORTENSIO : A' will make the man mad to make a woman of him <eos> KATHARINA : Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet Whither away or where is thy abode <eos> Happy the parents of so fair a child Happier the man whom favourable stars Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why how now Kate <eos> I hope thou art not mad : This is a man old wrinkled faded wither'd And not a maiden as thou say'st he is <eos> KATHARINA : Pardon old father my mistaking eyes That have been so bedazzled with the sun That everything I look on seemeth green : Now I perceive thou art a reverend father Pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking <eos> PETRUCHIO : Do good old grandsire and withal make known Which way thou travellest : if along with us We shall be joyful of thy company <eos> VINCENTIO : Fair sir and you my merry mistress That with your strange encounter much amazed me My name is call'd Vincentio my dwelling Pisa And bound I am to Padua there to visit A son of mine which long I have not seen <eos> PETRUCHIO : What is his name <eos> VINCENTIO : Lucentio gentle sir <eos> PETRUCHIO : Happily we met the happier for thy son <eos> And now by law as well as reverend age I may entitle thee my loving father : The sister to my wife this gentlewoman Thy son by this hath married <eos> Wonder not Nor be grieved : she is of good esteem Her dowery wealthy and of worthy birth Beside so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman <eos> Let me embrace with old Vincentio And wander we to see thy honest son Who will of thy arrival be full joyous <eos> VINCENTIO : But is it true <eos> or else is it your pleasure Like pleasant travellers to break a jest Upon the company you overtake <eos> HORTENSIO : I do assure thee father so it is <eos> PETRUCHIO : Come go along and see the truth hereof For our first merriment hath made thee jealous <eos> HORTENSIO : Well Petruchio this has put me in heart <eos> Have to my widow <eos> and if she be froward Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward <eos> BIONDELLO : Softly and swiftly sir for the priest is ready <eos> LUCENTIO : I fly Biondello : but they may chance to need thee at home therefore leave us <eos> BIONDELLO : Nay faith I'll see the church o' your back and then come back to my master's as soon as I can <eos> GREMIO : I marvel Cambio comes not all this while <eos> PETRUCHIO : Sir here's the door this is Lucentio's house : My father's bears more toward the market-place Thither must I and here I leave you sir <eos> VINCENTIO : You shall not choose but drink before you go : I think I shall command your welcome here And by all likelihood some cheer is toward <eos> GREMIO : They're busy within you were best knock louder <eos> Pedant : What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate <eos> VINCENTIO : Is Signior Lucentio within sir <eos> Pedant : He's within sir but not to be spoken withal <eos> VINCENTIO : What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal <eos> Pedant : Keep your hundred pounds to yourself : he shall need none so long as I live <eos> PETRUCHIO : Nay I told you your son was well beloved in Padua <eos> Do you hear sir <eos> To leave frivolous circumstances I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him <eos> Pedant : Thou liest : his father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window <eos> VINCENTIO : Art thou his father <eos> Pedant : Ay sir so his mother says if I may believe her <eos> PETRUCHIO : Pedant : Lay hands on the villain : I believe a' means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance <eos> BIONDELLO : I have seen them in the church together : God send 'em good shipping <eos> But who is here <eos> mine old master Vincentio <eos> now we are undone and brought to nothing <eos> VINCENTIO : BIONDELLO : Hope I may choose sir <eos> VINCENTIO : Come hither you rogue <eos> What have you forgot me <eos> BIONDELLO : Forgot you <eos> no sir : I could not forget you for I never saw you before in all my life <eos> VINCENTIO : What you notorious villain didst thou never see thy master's father Vincentio <eos> BIONDELLO : What my old worshipful old master <eos> yes marry sir : see where he looks out of the window <eos> VINCENTIO : Is't so indeed <eos> BIONDELLO : Help help help <eos> here's a madman will murder me <eos> Pedant : Help son <eos> help Signior Baptista <eos> PETRUCHIO : Prithee Kate let's stand aside and see the end of this controversy <eos> TRANIO : Sir what are you that offer to beat my servant <eos> VINCENTIO : What am I sir <eos> nay what are you sir <eos> O immortal gods <eos> O fine villain <eos> A silken doublet <eos> a velvet hose <eos> a scarlet cloak <eos> and a copatain hat <eos> O I am undone <eos> I am undone <eos> while I play the good husband at home my son and my servant spend all at the university <eos> TRANIO : How now <eos> what's the matter <eos> BAPTISTA : What is the man lunatic <eos> TRANIO : Sir you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit but your words show you a madman <eos> Why sir what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold <eos> I thank my good father I am able to maintain it <eos> VINCENTIO : Thy father <eos> O villain <eos> he is a sailmaker in Bergamo <eos> BAPTISTA : You mistake sir you mistake sir <eos> Pray what do you think is his name <eos> VINCENTIO : His name <eos> as if I knew not his name : I have brought him up ever since he was three years old and his name is Tranio <eos> Pedant : Away away mad ass <eos> his name is Lucentio and he is mine only son and heir to the lands of me Signior Vincentio <eos> VINCENTIO : Lucentio <eos> O he hath murdered his master <eos> Lay hold on him I charge you in the duke's name <eos> O my son my son <eos> Tell me thou villain where is my son Lucentio <eos> TRANIO : Call forth an officer <eos> Carry this mad knave to the gaol <eos> Father Baptista I charge you see that he be forthcoming <eos> VINCENTIO : Carry me to the gaol <eos> GREMIO : Stay officer : he shall not go to prison <eos> BAPTISTA : Talk not Signior Gremio : I say he shall go to prison <eos> GREMIO : Take heed Signior Baptista lest you be cony-catched in this business : I dare swear this is the right Vincentio <eos> Pedant : Swear if thou darest <eos> GREMIO : Nay I dare not swear it <eos> TRANIO : Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio <eos> GREMIO : Yes I know thee to be Signior Lucentio <eos> BAPTISTA : Away with the dotard <eos> to the gaol with him <eos> VINCENTIO : Thus strangers may be hailed and abused : O monstrous villain <eos> BIONDELLO : O <eos> we are spoiled and <eos>yonder he is : deny him forswear him or else we are all undone <eos> LUCENTIO : VINCENTIO : Lives my sweet son <eos> BIANCA : Pardon dear father <eos> BAPTISTA : How hast thou offended <eos> Where is Lucentio <eos> LUCENTIO : Here's Lucentio Right son to the right Vincentio That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne <eos> GREMIO : Here's packing with a witness to deceive us all <eos> VINCENTIO : Where is that damned villain Tranio That faced and braved me in this matter so <eos> BAPTISTA : Why tell me is not this my Cambio <eos> BIANCA : Cambio is changed into Lucentio <eos> LUCENTIO : Love wrought these miracles <eos> Bianca's love Made me exchange my state with Tranio While he did bear my countenance in the town And happily I have arrived at the last Unto the wished haven of my bliss <eos> What Tranio did myself enforced him to Then pardon him sweet father for my sake <eos> VINCENTIO : I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the gaol <eos> BAPTISTA : But do you hear sir <eos> have you married my daughter without asking my good will <eos> VINCENTIO : Fear not Baptista we will content you go to : but I will in to be revenged for this villany <eos> BAPTISTA : And I to sound the depth of this knavery <eos> LUCENTIO : Look not pale Bianca thy father will not frown <eos> GREMIO : My cake is dough but I'll in among the rest Out of hope of all but my share of the feast <eos> KATHARINA : Husband let's follow to see the end of this ado <eos> PETRUCHIO : First kiss me Kate and we will <eos> KATHARINA : What in the midst of the street <eos> PETRUCHIO : What art thou ashamed of me <eos> KATHARINA : No sir God forbid but ashamed to kiss <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why then let's home again <eos> Come sirrah let's away <eos> KATHARINA : Nay I will give thee a kiss : now pray thee love stay <eos> PETRUCHIO : Is not this well <eos> Come my sweet Kate : Better once than never for never too late <eos> LUCENTIO : At last though long our jarring notes agree : And time it is when raging war is done To smile at scapes and perils overblown <eos> My fair Bianca bid my father welcome While I with self-same kindness welcome thine <eos> Brother Petruchio sister Katharina And thou Hortensio with thy loving widow Feast with the best and welcome to my house : My banquet is to close our stomachs up After our great good cheer <eos> Pray you sit down For now we sit to chat as well as eat <eos> PETRUCHIO : Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat <eos> BAPTISTA : Padua affords this kindness son Petruchio <eos> PETRUCHIO : Padua affords nothing but what is kind <eos> HORTENSIO : For both our sakes I would that word were true <eos> PETRUCHIO : Now for my life Hortensio fears his widow <eos> Widow : Then never trust me if I be afeard <eos> PETRUCHIO : You are very sensible and yet you miss my sense : I mean Hortensio is afeard of you <eos> Widow : He that is giddy thinks the world turns round <eos> PETRUCHIO : Roundly replied <eos> KATHARINA : Mistress how mean you that <eos> Widow : Thus I conceive by him <eos> PETRUCHIO : Conceives by me <eos> How likes Hortensio that <eos> HORTENSIO : My widow says thus she conceives her tale <eos> PETRUCHIO : Very well mended <eos> Kiss him for that good widow <eos> KATHARINA : 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round :' I pray you tell me what you meant by that <eos> Widow : Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe : And now you know my meaning KATHARINA : A very mean meaning <eos> Widow : Right I mean you <eos> KATHARINA : And I am mean indeed respecting you <eos> PETRUCHIO : To her Kate <eos> HORTENSIO : To her widow <eos> PETRUCHIO : A hundred marks my Kate does put her down <eos> HORTENSIO : That's my office <eos> PETRUCHIO : Spoke like an officer ha' to thee lad <eos> BAPTISTA : How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks <eos> GREMIO : Believe me sir they butt together well <eos> BIANCA : Head and butt <eos> an hasty-witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn <eos> VINCENTIO : Ay mistress bride hath that awaken'd you <eos> BIANCA : Ay but not frighted me therefore I'll sleep again <eos> PETRUCHIO : Nay that you shall not : since you have begun Have at you for a bitter jest or two <eos> BIANCA : Am I your bird <eos> I mean to shift my bush And then pursue me as you draw your bow <eos> You are welcome all <eos> PETRUCHIO : She hath prevented me <eos> Here Signior Tranio <eos> This bird you aim'd at though you hit her not Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd <eos> TRANIO : O sir Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound Which runs himself and catches for his master <eos> PETRUCHIO : A good swift simile but something currish <eos> TRANIO : 'Tis well sir that you hunted for yourself : 'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay <eos> BAPTISTA : O ho Petruchio <eos> Tranio hits you now <eos> LUCENTIO : I thank thee for that gird good Tranio <eos> HORTENSIO : Confess confess hath he not hit you here <eos> PETRUCHIO : A' has a little gall'd me I confess And as the jest did glance away from me 'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright <eos> BAPTISTA : Now in good sadness son Petruchio I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all <eos> PETRUCHIO : Well I say no : and therefore for assurance Let's each one send unto his wife And he whose wife is most obedient To come at first when he doth send for her Shall win the wager which we will propose <eos> HORTENSIO : Content <eos> What is the wager <eos> LUCENTIO : Twenty crowns <eos> PETRUCHIO : Twenty crowns <eos> I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound But twenty times so much upon my wife <eos> LUCENTIO : A hundred then <eos> HORTENSIO : Content <eos> PETRUCHIO : A match <eos> 'tis done <eos> HORTENSIO : Who shall begin <eos> LUCENTIO : That will I <eos> Go Biondello bid your mistress come to me <eos> BIONDELLO : I go <eos> BAPTISTA : Son I'll be your half Bianca comes <eos> LUCENTIO : I'll have no halves I'll bear it all myself <eos> How now <eos> what news <eos> BIONDELLO : Sir my mistress sends you word That she is busy and she cannot come <eos> PETRUCHIO : How <eos> she is busy and she cannot come <eos> Is that an answer <eos> GREMIO : Ay and a kind one too : Pray God sir your wife send you not a worse <eos> PETRUCHIO : I hope better <eos> HORTENSIO : Sirrah Biondello go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith <eos> PETRUCHIO : O ho <eos> entreat her <eos> Nay then she must needs come <eos> HORTENSIO : I am afraid sir Do what you can yours will not be entreated <eos> Now where's my wife <eos> BIONDELLO : She says you have some goodly jest in hand : She will not come : she bids you come to her <eos> PETRUCHIO : Worse and worse she will not come <eos> O vile Intolerable not to be endured <eos> Sirrah Grumio go to your mistress Say I command her to come to me <eos> HORTENSIO : I know her answer <eos> PETRUCHIO : What <eos> HORTENSIO : She will not <eos> PETRUCHIO : The fouler fortune mine and there an end <eos> BAPTISTA : Now by my holidame here comes Katharina <eos> KATHARINA : What is your will sir that you send for me <eos> PETRUCHIO : Where is your sister and Hortensio's wife <eos> KATHARINA : They sit conferring by the parlor fire <eos> PETRUCHIO : Go fetch them hither : if they deny to come <eos> Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands : Away I say and bring them hither straight <eos> LUCENTIO : Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder <eos> HORTENSIO : And so it is : I wonder what it bodes <eos> PETRUCHIO : Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life And awful rule and right supremacy And to be short what not that's sweet and happy <eos> BAPTISTA : Now fair befal thee good Petruchio <eos> The wager thou hast won and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns Another dowry to another daughter For she is changed as she had never been <eos> PETRUCHIO : Nay I will win my wager better yet And show more sign of her obedience Her new-built virtue and obedience <eos> See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion <eos> Katharina that cap of yours becomes you not : Off with that bauble throw it under-foot <eos> Widow : Lord let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass <eos> BIANCA : Fie <eos> what a foolish duty call you this <eos> LUCENTIO : I would your duty were as foolish too : The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time <eos> BIANCA : The more fool you for laying on my duty <eos> PETRUCHIO : Katharina I charge thee tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands <eos> Widow : Come come you're mocking : we will have no telling <eos> PETRUCHIO : Come on I say and first begin with her <eos> Widow : She shall not <eos> PETRUCHIO : I say she shall : and first begin with her <eos> KATHARINA : Fie fie <eos> unknit that threatening unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord thy king thy governor : It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds And in no sense is meet or amiable <eos> A woman moved is like a fountain troubled Muddy ill-seeming thick bereft of beauty And while it is so none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it <eos> Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land To watch the night in storms the day in cold Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love fair looks and true obedience Too little payment for so great a debt <eos> Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord <eos> I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey <eos> Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toil and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts <eos> Come come you froward and unable worms <eos> My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are <eos> Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot And place your hands below your husband's foot : In token of which duty if he please My hand is ready may it do him ease <eos> PETRUCHIO : Why there's a wench <eos> Come on and kiss me Kate <eos> LUCENTIO : Well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't <eos> VINCENTIO : 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward <eos> LUCENTIO : But a harsh hearing when women are froward <eos> PETRUCHIO : Come Kate we'll to bed <eos> We three are married but you two are sped <eos> 'Twas I won the wager though you hit the white And being a winner God give you good night <eos> HORTENSIO : Now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew <eos> LUCENTIO : 'Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so <eos> Master : Boatswain <eos> Boatswain : Here master : what cheer <eos> Master : Good speak to the mariners : fall to't yarely or we run ourselves aground : bestir bestir <eos> Boatswain : Heigh my hearts <eos> cheerly cheerly my hearts <eos> yare yare <eos> Take in the topsail <eos> Tend to the master's whistle <eos> Blow till thou burst thy wind if room enough <eos> ALONSO : Good boatswain have care <eos> Where's the master <eos> Play the men <eos> Boatswain : I pray now keep below <eos> ANTONIO : Where is the master boatswain <eos> Boatswain : Do you not hear him <eos> You mar our labour : keep your cabins : you do assist the storm <eos> GONZALO : Nay good be patient <eos> Boatswain : When the sea is <eos> Hence <eos> What cares these roarers for the name of king <eos> To cabin : silence <eos> trouble us not <eos> GONZALO : Good yet remember whom thou hast aboard <eos> Boatswain : None that I more love than myself <eos> You are a counsellor if you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present we will not hand a rope more use your authority : if you cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour if it so hap <eos> Cheerly good hearts <eos> Out of our way I say <eos> GONZALO : I have great comfort from this fellow : methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him his complexion is perfect gallows <eos> Stand fast good Fate to his hanging : make the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage <eos> If he be not born to be hanged our case is miserable <eos> Boatswain : Down with the topmast <eos> yare <eos> lower lower <eos> Bring her to try with main-course <eos> A plague upon this howling <eos> they are louder than the weather or our office <eos> Yet again <eos> what do you here <eos> Shall we give o'er and drown <eos> Have you a mind to sink <eos> SEBASTIAN : A pox o' your throat you bawling blasphemous incharitable dog <eos> Boatswain : Work you then <eos> ANTONIO : Hang cur <eos> hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker <eos> We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art <eos> GONZALO : I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench <eos> Boatswain : Lay her a-hold a-hold <eos> set her two courses off to sea again lay her off <eos> Mariners : All lost <eos> to prayers to prayers <eos> all lost <eos> Boatswain : What must our mouths be cold <eos> GONZALO : The king and prince at prayers <eos> let's assist them For our case is as theirs <eos> SEBASTIAN : I'm out of patience <eos> ANTONIO : We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards : This wide-chapp'd rascal <eos>would thou mightst lie drowning The washing of ten tides <eos> GONZALO : He'll be hang'd yet Though every drop of water swear against it And gape at widest to glut him <eos> ANTONIO : Let's all sink with the king <eos> SEBASTIAN : Let's take leave of him <eos> GONZALO : Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any thing <eos> The wills above be done <eos> but I would fain die a dry death <eos> MIRANDA : If by your art my dearest father you have Put the wild waters in this roar allay them <eos> The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch But that the sea mounting to the welkin's cheek Dashes the fire out <eos> O I have suffered With those that I saw suffer : a brave vessel Who had no doubt some noble creature in her Dash'd all to pieces <eos> O the cry did knock Against my very heart <eos> Poor souls they perish'd <eos> Had I been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallow'd and The fraughting souls within her <eos> PROSPERO : Be collected : No more amazement : tell your piteous heart There's no harm done <eos> MIRANDA : O woe the day <eos> PROSPERO : No harm <eos> I have done nothing but in care of thee Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who Art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing Of whence I am nor that I am more better Than Prospero master of a full poor cell And thy no greater father <eos> MIRANDA : More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts <eos> PROSPERO : 'Tis time I should inform thee farther <eos> Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me <eos> So : Lie there my art <eos> Wipe thou thine eyes have comfort <eos> The direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd The very virtue of compassion in thee I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul <eos> No not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink <eos> Sit down For thou must now know farther <eos> MIRANDA : You have often Begun to tell me what I am but stopp'd And left me to a bootless inquisition Concluding 'Stay : not yet <eos>' PROSPERO : The hour's now come The very minute bids thee ope thine ear Obey and be attentive <eos> Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell <eos> I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not Out three years old <eos> MIRANDA : Certainly sir I can <eos> PROSPERO : By what <eos> by any other house or person <eos> Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance <eos> MIRANDA : 'Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants <eos> Had I not Four or five women once that tended me <eos> PROSPERO : Thou hadst and more Miranda <eos> But how is it That this lives in thy mind <eos> What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time <eos> If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here How thou camest here thou mayst <eos> MIRANDA : But that I do not <eos> PROSPERO : Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power <eos> MIRANDA : Sir are not you my father <eos> PROSPERO : Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter and thy father Was Duke of Milan and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued <eos> MIRANDA : O the heavens <eos> What foul play had we that we came from thence <eos> Or blessed was't we did <eos> PROSPERO : Both both my girl : By foul play as thou say'st were we heaved thence But blessedly holp hither <eos> MIRANDA : O my heart bleeds To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to Which is from my remembrance <eos> Please you farther <eos> PROSPERO : My brother and thy uncle call'd Antonio <eos> I pray thee mark me <eos>that a brother should Be so perfidious <eos> <eos>he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed In dignity and for the liberal arts Without a parallel those being all my study The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger being transported And rapt in secret studies <eos> Thy false uncle <eos> Dost thou attend me <eos> MIRANDA : Sir most heedfully <eos> PROSPERO : Being once perfected how to grant suits How to deny them who to advance and who To trash for over-topping new created The creatures that were mine I say or changed 'em Or else new form'd 'em having both the key Of officer and office set all hearts i' the state To what tune pleased his ear that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk And suck'd my verdure out on't <eos> Thou attend'st not <eos> MIRANDA : O good sir I do <eos> PROSPERO : I pray thee mark me <eos> I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which but by being so retired O'er-prized all popular rate in my false brother Awaked an evil nature and my trust Like a good parent did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was which had indeed no limit A confidence sans bound <eos> He being thus lorded Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact like one Who having into truth by telling of it Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie he did believe He was indeed the duke out o' the substitution And executing the outward face of royalty With all prerogative : hence his ambition growing <eos> Dost thou hear <eos> MIRANDA : Your tale sir would cure deafness <eos> PROSPERO : To have no screen between this part he play'd And him he play'd it for he needs will be Absolute Milan <eos> Me poor man my library Was dukedom large enough : of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable confederates <eos> So dry he was for sway <eos>wi' the King of Naples To give him annual tribute do him homage Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbow'd <eos>alas poor Milan <eos> <eos> To most ignoble stooping <eos> MIRANDA : O the heavens <eos> PROSPERO : Mark his condition and the event then tell me If this might be a brother <eos> MIRANDA : I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother : Good wombs have borne bad sons <eos> PROSPERO : Now the condition <eos> The King of Naples being an enemy To me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit Which was that he in lieu o' the premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honours on my brother : whereon A treacherous army levied one midnight Fated to the purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan and i' the dead of darkness The ministers for the purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self <eos> MIRANDA : Alack for pity <eos> I not remembering how I cried out then Will cry it o'er again : it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to't <eos> PROSPERO : Hear a little further And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now's upon's without the which this story Were most impertinent <eos> MIRANDA : Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us <eos> PROSPERO : Well demanded wench : My tale provokes that question <eos> Dear they durst not So dear the love my people bore me nor set A mark so bloody on the business but With colours fairer painted their foul ends <eos> In few they hurried us aboard a bark Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared A rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd Nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats Instinctively had quit it : there they hoist us To cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh To the winds whose pity sighing back again Did us but loving wrong <eos> MIRANDA : Alack what trouble Was I then to you <eos> PROSPERO : O a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me <eos> Thou didst smile <eos> Infused with a fortitude from heaven When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt Under my burthen groan'd which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue <eos> MIRANDA : How came we ashore <eos> PROSPERO : By Providence divine <eos> Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo Out of his charity being then appointed Master of this design did give us with Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries Which since have steaded much so of his gentleness Knowing I loved my books he furnish'd me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom <eos> MIRANDA : Would I might But ever see that man <eos> PROSPERO : Now I arise : Sit still and hear the last of our sea-sorrow <eos> Here in this island we arrived and here Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit Than other princesses can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful <eos> MIRANDA : Heavens thank you for't <eos> And now I pray you sir For still 'tis beating in my mind your reason For raising this sea-storm <eos> PROSPERO : Know thus far forth <eos> By accident most strange bountiful Fortune Now my dear lady hath mine enemies Brought to this shore and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star whose influence If now I court not but omit my fortunes Will ever after droop <eos> Here cease more questions : Thou art inclined to sleep 'tis a good dulness And give it way : I know thou canst not choose <eos> Come away servant come <eos> I am ready now <eos> Approach my Ariel come <eos> ARIEL : All hail great master <eos> grave sir hail <eos> I come To answer thy best pleasure be't to fly To swim to dive into the fire to ride On the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality <eos> PROSPERO : Hast thou spirit Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee <eos> ARIEL : To every article <eos> I boarded the king's ship now on the beak Now in the waist the deck in every cabin I flamed amazement : sometime I'ld divide And burn in many places on the topmast The yards and bowsprit would I flame distinctly Then meet and join <eos> Jove's lightnings the precursors O' the dreadful thunder-claps more momentary And sight-outrunning were not the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble Yea his dread trident shake <eos> PROSPERO : My brave spirit <eos> Who was so firm so constant that this coil Would not infect his reason <eos> ARIEL : Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and play'd Some tricks of desperation <eos> All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel Then all afire with me : the king's son Ferdinand With hair up-staring <eos>then like reeds not hair <eos> Was the first man that leap'd cried 'Hell is empty And all the devils are here <eos>' PROSPERO : Why that's my spirit <eos> But was not this nigh shore <eos> ARIEL : Close by my master <eos> PROSPERO : But are they Ariel safe <eos> ARIEL : Not a hair perish'd On their sustaining garments not a blemish But fresher than before : and as thou badest me In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle <eos> The king's son have I landed by himself Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting His arms in this sad knot <eos> PROSPERO : Of the king's ship The mariners say how thou hast disposed And all the rest o' the fleet <eos> ARIEL : Safely in harbour Is the king's ship in the deep nook where once Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vex'd Bermoothes there she's hid : The mariners all under hatches stow'd Who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour I have left asleep and for the rest o' the fleet Which I dispersed they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean flote Bound sadly home for Naples Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd And his great person perish <eos> PROSPERO : Ariel thy charge Exactly is perform'd : but there's more work <eos> What is the time o' the day <eos> ARIEL : Past the mid season <eos> PROSPERO : At least two glasses <eos> The time 'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously <eos> ARIEL : Is there more toil <eos> Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promised Which is not yet perform'd me <eos> PROSPERO : How now <eos> moody <eos> What is't thou canst demand <eos> ARIEL : My liberty <eos> PROSPERO : Before the time be out <eos> no more <eos> ARIEL : I prithee Remember I have done thee worthy service Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served Without or grudge or grumblings : thou didst promise To bate me a full year <eos> PROSPERO : Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee <eos> ARIEL : No <eos> PROSPERO : Thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep To run upon the sharp wind of the north To do me business in the veins o' the earth When it is baked with frost <eos> ARIEL : I do not sir <eos> PROSPERO : Thou liest malignant thing <eos> Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop <eos> hast thou forgot her <eos> ARIEL : No sir <eos> PROSPERO : Thou hast <eos> Where was she born <eos> speak tell me <eos> ARIEL : Sir in Argier <eos> PROSPERO : O was she so <eos> I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been Which thou forget'st <eos> This damn'd witch Sycorax For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing from Argier Thou know'st was banish'd : for one thing she did They would not take her life <eos> Is not this true <eos> ARIEL : Ay sir <eos> PROSPERO : This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by the sailors <eos> Thou my slave As thou report'st thyself wast then her servant And for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage Into a cloven pine within which rift Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain A dozen years within which space she died And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill-wheels strike <eos> Then was this island <eos> Save for the son that she did litter here A freckled whelp hag-born <eos>not honour'd with A human shape <eos> ARIEL : Yes Caliban her son <eos> PROSPERO : Dull thing I say so he that Caliban Whom now I keep in service <eos> Thou best know'st What torment I did find thee in thy groans Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts Of ever angry bears : it was a torment To lay upon the damn'd which Sycorax Could not again undo : it was mine art When I arrived and heard thee that made gape The pine and let thee out <eos> ARIEL : I thank thee master <eos> PROSPERO : If thou more murmur'st I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters <eos> ARIEL : Pardon master I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently <eos> PROSPERO : Do so and after two days I will discharge thee <eos> ARIEL : That's my noble master <eos> What shall I do <eos> say what what shall I do <eos> PROSPERO : Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea : be subject To no sight but thine and mine invisible To every eyeball else <eos> Go take this shape And hither come in't : go hence with diligence <eos> Awake dear heart awake <eos> thou hast slept well Awake <eos> MIRANDA : The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me <eos> PROSPERO : Shake it off <eos> Come on We'll visit Caliban my slave who never Yields us kind answer <eos> MIRANDA : 'Tis a villain sir I do not love to look on <eos> PROSPERO : But as 'tis We cannot miss him : he does make our fire Fetch in our wood and serves in offices That profit us <eos> What ho <eos> slave <eos> Caliban <eos> Thou earth thou <eos> speak <eos> CALIBAN : PROSPERO : Come forth I say <eos> there's other business for thee : Come thou tortoise <eos> when <eos> Fine apparition <eos> My quaint Ariel Hark in thine ear <eos> ARIEL : My lord it shall be done <eos> PROSPERO : Thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam come forth <eos> CALIBAN : As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd With raven's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both <eos> a south-west blow on ye And blister you all o'er <eos> PROSPERO : For this be sure to-night thou shalt have cramps Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins Shall for that vast of night that they may work All exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd As thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em <eos> CALIBAN : I must eat my dinner <eos> This island's mine by Sycorax my mother Which thou takest from me <eos> When thou camest first Thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me Water with berries in't and teach me how To name the bigger light and how the less That burn by day and night : and then I loved thee And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle The fresh springs brine-pits barren place and fertile : Cursed be I that did so <eos> All the charms Of Sycorax toads beetles bats light on you <eos> For I am all the subjects that you have Which first was mine own king : and here you sty me In this hard rock whiles you do keep from me The rest o' the island <eos> PROSPERO : Thou most lying slave Whom stripes may move not kindness <eos> I have used thee Filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child <eos> CALIBAN : O ho O ho <eos> would't had been done <eos> Thou didst prevent me I had peopled else This isle with Calibans <eos> PROSPERO : Abhorred slave Which any print of goodness wilt not take Being capable of all ill <eos> I pitied thee Took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour One thing or other : when thou didst not savage Know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish I endow'd thy purposes With words that made them known <eos> But thy vile race Though thou didst learn had that in't which good natures Could not abide to be with therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock Who hadst deserved more than a prison <eos> CALIBAN : You taught me language and my profit on't Is I know how to curse <eos> The red plague rid you For learning me your language <eos> PROSPERO : Hag-seed hence <eos> Fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best To answer other business <eos> Shrug'st thou malice <eos> If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly What I command I'll rack thee with old cramps Fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar That beasts shall tremble at thy din <eos> CALIBAN : No pray thee <eos> I must obey : his art is of such power It would control my dam's god Setebos and make a vassal of him <eos> PROSPERO : So slave hence <eos> Come unto these yellow sands And then take hands : Courtsied when you have and kiss'd The wild waves whist Foot it featly here and there And sweet sprites the burthen bear <eos> Hark hark <eos> FERDINAND : Where should this music be <eos> i' the air or the earth <eos> It sounds no more : and sure it waits upon Some god o' the island <eos> Sitting on a bank Weeping again the king my father's wreck This music crept by me upon the waters Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air : thence I have follow'd it Or it hath drawn me rather <eos> But 'tis gone <eos> No it begins again <eos> Full fathom five thy father lies Of his bones are coral made Those are pearls that were his eyes : Nothing of him that doth fade But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange <eos> Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell Hark <eos> now I hear them <eos>Ding-dong bell <eos> FERDINAND : The ditty does remember my drown'd father <eos> This is no mortal business nor no sound That the earth owes <eos> I hear it now above me <eos> PROSPERO : The fringed curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond <eos> MIRANDA : What is't <eos> a spirit <eos> Lord how it looks about <eos> Believe me sir It carries a brave form <eos> But 'tis a spirit <eos> PROSPERO : No wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have such <eos> This gallant which thou seest Was in the wreck and but he's something stain'd With grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him A goodly person : he hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em <eos> MIRANDA : I might call him A thing divine for nothing natural I ever saw so noble <eos> PROSPERO : FERDINAND : Most sure the goddess On whom these airs attend <eos> Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here : my prime request Which I do last pronounce is O you wonder <eos> If you be maid or no <eos> MIRANDA : No wonder sir But certainly a maid <eos> FERDINAND : My language <eos> heavens <eos> I am the best of them that speak this speech Were I but where 'tis spoken <eos> PROSPERO : How <eos> the best <eos> What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee <eos> FERDINAND : A single thing as I am now that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples <eos> He does hear me And that he does I weep : myself am Naples Who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld The king my father wreck'd <eos> MIRANDA : Alack for mercy <eos> FERDINAND : Yes faith and all his lords the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain <eos> PROSPERO : MIRANDA : Why speaks my father so ungently <eos> This Is the third man that e'er I saw the first That e'er I sigh'd for : pity move my father To be inclined my way <eos> FERDINAND : O if a virgin And your affection not gone forth I'll make you The queen of Naples <eos> PROSPERO : Soft sir <eos> one word more <eos> They are both in either's powers but this swift business I must uneasy make lest too light winning Make the prize light <eos> One word more I charge thee That thou attend me : thou dost here usurp The name thou owest not and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy to win it From me the lord on't <eos> FERDINAND : No as I am a man <eos> MIRANDA : There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple : If the ill spirit have so fair a house Good things will strive to dwell with't <eos> PROSPERO : Follow me <eos> Speak not you for him he's a traitor <eos> Come I'll manacle thy neck and feet together : Sea-water shalt thou drink thy food shall be The fresh-brook muscles wither'd roots and husks Wherein the acorn cradled <eos> Follow <eos> FERDINAND : No I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power <eos> MIRANDA : O dear father Make not too rash a trial of him for He's gentle and not fearful <eos> PROSPERO : What <eos> I say My foot my tutor <eos> Put thy sword up traitor Who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience Is so possess'd with guilt : come from thy ward For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop <eos> MIRANDA : Beseech you father <eos> PROSPERO : Hence <eos> hang not on my garments <eos> MIRANDA : Sir have pity I'll be his surety <eos> PROSPERO : Silence <eos> one word more Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee <eos> What <eos> An advocate for an imposter <eos> hush <eos> Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he Having seen but him and Caliban : foolish wench <eos> To the most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels <eos> MIRANDA : My affections Are then most humble I have no ambition To see a goodlier man <eos> PROSPERO : Come on obey : Thy nerves are in their infancy again And have no vigour in them <eos> FERDINAND : So they are My spirits as in a dream are all bound up <eos> My father's loss the weakness which I feel The wreck of all my friends nor this man's threats To whom I am subdued are but light to me Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid : all corners else o' the earth Let liberty make use of space enough Have I in such a prison <eos> PROSPERO : MIRANDA : Be of comfort My father's of a better nature sir Than he appears by speech : this is unwonted Which now came from him <eos> PROSPERO : Thou shalt be free As mountain winds : but then exactly do All points of my command <eos> ARIEL : To the syllable <eos> PROSPERO : Come follow <eos> Speak not for him <eos> GONZALO : Beseech you sir be merry you have cause So have we all of joy for our escape Is much beyond our loss <eos> Our hint of woe Is common every day some sailor's wife The masters of some merchant and the merchant Have just our theme of woe but for the miracle I mean our preservation few in millions Can speak like us : then wisely good sir weigh Our sorrow with our comfort <eos> ALONSO : Prithee peace <eos> SEBASTIAN : He receives comfort like cold porridge <eos> ANTONIO : The visitor will not give him o'er so <eos> SEBASTIAN : Look he's winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike <eos> GONZALO : Sir <eos> SEBASTIAN : One : tell <eos> GONZALO : When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd Comes to the entertainer <eos> SEBASTIAN : A dollar <eos> GONZALO : Dolour comes to him indeed : you have spoken truer than you purposed <eos> SEBASTIAN : You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should <eos> GONZALO : Therefore my lord <eos> ANTONIO : Fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue <eos> ALONSO : I prithee spare <eos> GONZALO : Well I have done : but yet <eos> SEBASTIAN : He will be talking <eos> ANTONIO : Which of he or Adrian for a good wager first begins to crow <eos> SEBASTIAN : The old cock <eos> ANTONIO : The cockerel <eos> SEBASTIAN : Done <eos> The wager <eos> ANTONIO : A laughter <eos> SEBASTIAN : A match <eos> ADRIAN : Though this island seem to be desert <eos> SEBASTIAN : Ha ha ha <eos> So you're paid <eos> ADRIAN : Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible <eos> SEBASTIAN : Yet <eos> ADRIAN : Yet <eos> ANTONIO : He could not miss't <eos> ADRIAN : It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance <eos> ANTONIO : Temperance was a delicate wench <eos> SEBASTIAN : Ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered <eos> ADRIAN : The air breathes upon us here most sweetly <eos> SEBASTIAN : As if it had lungs and rotten ones <eos> ANTONIO : Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen <eos> GONZALO : Here is everything advantageous to life <eos> ANTONIO : True save means to live <eos> SEBASTIAN : Of that there's none or little <eos> GONZALO : How lush and lusty the grass looks <eos> how green <eos> ANTONIO : The ground indeed is tawny <eos> SEBASTIAN : With an eye of green in't <eos> ANTONIO : He misses not much <eos> SEBASTIAN : No he doth but mistake the truth totally <eos> GONZALO : But the rarity of it is <eos>which is indeed almost beyond credit <eos> SEBASTIAN : As many vouched rarities are <eos> GONZALO : That our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water <eos> ANTONIO : If but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies <eos> SEBASTIAN : Ay or very falsely pocket up his report GONZALO : Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis <eos> SEBASTIAN : 'Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return <eos> ADRIAN : Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen <eos> GONZALO : Not since widow Dido's time <eos> ANTONIO : Widow <eos> a pox o' that <eos> How came that widow in <eos> widow Dido <eos> SEBASTIAN : What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too <eos> Good Lord how you take it <eos> ADRIAN : 'Widow Dido' said you <eos> you make me study of that : she was of Carthage not of Tunis <eos> GONZALO : This Tunis sir was Carthage <eos> ADRIAN : Carthage <eos> GONZALO : I assure you Carthage <eos> SEBASTIAN : His word is more than the miraculous harp he hath raised the wall and houses too <eos> ANTONIO : What impossible matter will he make easy next <eos> SEBASTIAN : I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple <eos> ANTONIO : And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands <eos> GONZALO : Ay <eos> ANTONIO : Why in good time <eos> GONZALO : Sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queen <eos> ANTONIO : And the rarest that e'er came there <eos> SEBASTIAN : Bate I beseech you widow Dido <eos> ANTONIO : O widow Dido <eos> ay widow Dido <eos> GONZALO : Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it <eos> I mean in a sort <eos> ANTONIO : That sort was well fished for <eos> GONZALO : When I wore it at your daughter's marriage <eos> ALONSO : You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense <eos> Would I had never Married my daughter there <eos> for coming thence My son is lost and in my rate she too Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her <eos> O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee <eos> FRANCISCO : Sir he may live : I saw him beat the surges under him And ride upon their backs he trod the water Whose enmity he flung aside and breasted The surge most swoln that met him his bold head 'Bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To the shore that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd As stooping to relieve him : I not doubt He came alive to land <eos> ALONSO : No no he's gone <eos> SEBASTIAN : Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss That would not bless our Europe with your daughter But rather lose her to an African Where she at least is banish'd from your eye Who hath cause to wet the grief on't <eos> ALONSO : Prithee peace <eos> SEBASTIAN : You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise By all of us and the fair soul herself Weigh'd between loathness and obedience at Which end o' the beam should bow <eos> We have lost your son I fear for ever : Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making Than we bring men to comfort them : The fault's your own <eos> ALONSO : So is the dear'st o' the loss <eos> GONZALO : My lord Sebastian The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in : you rub the sore When you should bring the plaster <eos> SEBASTIAN : Very well <eos> ANTONIO : And most chirurgeonly <eos> GONZALO : It is foul weather in us all good sir When you are cloudy <eos> SEBASTIAN : Foul weather <eos> ANTONIO : Very foul <eos> GONZALO : Had I plantation of this isle my lord <eos> ANTONIO : He'ld sow't with nettle-seed <eos> SEBASTIAN : Or docks or mallows <eos> GONZALO : And were the king on't what would I do <eos> SEBASTIAN : 'Scape being drunk for want of wine <eos> GONZALO : I' the commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things for no kind of traffic Would I admit no name of magistrate Letters should not be known riches poverty And use of service none contract succession Bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none No use of metal corn or wine or oil No occupation all men idle all And women too but innocent and pure No sovereignty <eos> SEBASTIAN : Yet he would be king on't <eos> ANTONIO : The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning <eos> GONZALO : All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavour : treason felony Sword pike knife gun or need of any engine Would I not have but nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison all abundance To feed my innocent people <eos> SEBASTIAN : No marrying 'mong his subjects <eos> ANTONIO : None man all idle : whores and knaves <eos> GONZALO : I would with such perfection govern sir To excel the golden age <eos> SEBASTIAN : God save his majesty <eos> ANTONIO : Long live Gonzalo <eos> GONZALO : And <eos>do you mark me sir <eos> ALONSO : Prithee no more : thou dost talk nothing to me <eos> GONZALO : I do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing <eos> ANTONIO : 'Twas you we laughed at <eos> GONZALO : Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you : so you may continue and laugh at nothing still <eos> ANTONIO : What a blow was there given <eos> SEBASTIAN : An it had not fallen flat-long <eos> GONZALO : You are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing <eos> SEBASTIAN : We would so and then go a bat-fowling <eos> ANTONIO : Nay good my lord be not angry <eos> GONZALO : No I warrant you I will not adventure my discretion so weakly <eos> Will you laugh me asleep for I am very heavy <eos> ANTONIO : Go sleep and hear us <eos> ALONSO : What all so soon asleep <eos> I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts : I find They are inclined to do so <eos> SEBASTIAN : Please you sir Do not omit the heavy offer of it : It seldom visits sorrow when it doth It is a comforter <eos> ANTONIO : We two my lord Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety <eos> ALONSO : Thank you <eos> Wondrous heavy <eos> SEBASTIAN : What a strange drowsiness possesses them <eos> ANTONIO : It is the quality o' the climate <eos> SEBASTIAN : Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink <eos> I find not Myself disposed to sleep <eos> ANTONIO : Nor I my spirits are nimble <eos> They fell together all as by consent They dropp'd as by a thunder-stroke <eos> What might Worthy Sebastian <eos> O what might <eos> <eos>No more : <eos> And yet me thinks I see it in thy face What thou shouldst be : the occasion speaks thee and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head <eos> SEBASTIAN : What art thou waking <eos> ANTONIO : Do you not hear me speak <eos> SEBASTIAN : I do and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep <eos> What is it thou didst say <eos> This is a strange repose to be asleep With eyes wide open standing speaking moving And yet so fast asleep <eos> ANTONIO : Noble Sebastian Thou let'st thy fortune sleep <eos>die rather wink'st Whiles thou art waking <eos>\""

              "\"first citizen : before we proceed any further hear me speak <eos> all : speak speak <eos> first citizen : you are all resolved rather to die than to famish <eos> all : resolved <eos> resolved <eos> first citizen : first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people <eos> all : we know't we know't <eos> first citizen : let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price <eos> is't a verdict <eos> all : no more talking on't let it be done : away away <eos> second citizen : one word good citizens <eos> first citizen : we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good <eos> what authority surfeits on would relieve us : if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear : the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes : for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge <eos> second citizen : would you proceed especially against caius marcius <eos> all : against him first : he's a very dog to the commonalty <eos> second citizen : consider you what services he has done for his country <eos> first citizen : very well and could be content to give him good report fort but that he pays himself with being proud <eos> second citizen : nay but speak not maliciously <eos> first citizen : i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end : though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even till the altitude of his virtue <eos> second citizen : what he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him <eos> you must in no way say he is covetous <eos> first citizen : if i must not i need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition <eos> what shouts are these <eos> the other side o' the city is risen : why stay we prating here <eos> to the capitol <eos> all : come come <eos> first citizen : soft <eos> who comes here <eos> second citizen : worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved the people <eos> first citizen : he's one honest enough : would all the rest were so <eos> menenius : what work's my countrymen in hand <eos> where go you with bats and clubs <eos> the matter <eos> speak i pray you <eos> first citizen : our business is not unknown to the senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we'll show 'em in deeds <eos> they say poor suitors have strong breaths : they shall know we have strong arms too <eos> menenius : why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours will you undo yourselves <eos> first citizen : we cannot sir we are undone already <eos> menenius : i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you <eos> for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment <eos> for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help <eos> alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o' the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies <eos> first citizen : care for us <eos> true indeed <eos> they ne'er cared for us yet : suffer us to famish and their store-houses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor <eos> if the wars eat us not up they will and there's all the love they bear us <eos> menenius : either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly <eos> i shall tell you a pretty tale : it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale 't a little more <eos> first citizen : well i'll hear it sir : yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale : but an 't please you deliver <eos> menenius : there was a time when all the body's members rebell'd against the belly thus accused it : that only like a gulf it did remain i' the midst o' the body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where the other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body <eos> the belly answer'd <eos> first citizen : well sir what answer made the belly <eos> menenius : sir i shall tell you <eos> with a kind of smile which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus <eos> for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speak <eos>it tauntingly replied to the discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you <eos> first citizen : your belly's answer <eos> what <eos> the kingly-crowned head the vigilant eye the counsellor heart the arm our soldier our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter <eos> with other muniments and petty helps in this our fabric if that they <eos> menenius : what then <eos> 'fore me this fellow speaks <eos> what then <eos> what then <eos> first citizen : should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd who is the sink o' the body <eos> menenius : well what then <eos> first citizen : the former agents if they did complain what could the belly answer <eos> menenius : i will tell you if you'll bestow a small <eos>of what you have little <eos> patience awhile you'll hear the belly's answer <eos> first citizen : ye're long about it <eos> menenius : note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answer'd : 'true is it my incorporate friends' quoth he 'that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the store-house and the shop of the whole body : but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to the seat o' the brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live : and though that all at once you my good friends' <eos>this says the belly mark me <eos> first citizen : ay sir well well <eos> menenius : 'though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran <eos>' what say you to't <eos> first citizen : it was an answer : how apply you this <eos> menenius : the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o' the common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves <eos> what do you think you the great toe of this assembly <eos> first citizen : i the great toe <eos> why the great toe <eos> menenius : for that being one o' the lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou go'st foremost : thou rascal that art worst in blood to run lead'st first to win some vantage <eos> but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs : rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale <eos> hail noble marcius <eos> marcius : thanks <eos> what's the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs <eos> first citizen : we have ever your good word <eos> marcius : he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring <eos> what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war <eos> the one affrights you the other makes you proud <eos> he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese : you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun <eos> your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it <eos> who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick man's appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil <eos> he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes <eos> hang ye <eos> trust ye <eos> with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland <eos> what's the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another <eos> what's their seeking <eos> menenius : for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored <eos> marcius : hang 'em <eos> they say <eos> they'll sit by the fire and presume to know what's done i' the capitol who's like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes <eos> they say there's grain enough <eos> would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword i'll make a quarry with thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high as i could pick my lance <eos> menenius : nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly <eos> but i beseech you what says the other troop <eos> marcius : they are dissolved : hang 'em <eos> they said they were an-hungry sigh'd forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only : with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answer'd and a petition granted them a strange one <eos> to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale <eos>they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o' the moon shouting their emulation <eos> menenius : what is granted them <eos> marcius : five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice : one's junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know not <eos>'sdeath <eos> the rabble should have first unroof'd the city ere so prevail'd with me : it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection's arguing <eos> menenius : this is strange <eos> marcius : go get you home you fragments <eos> messenger : where's caius marcius <eos> marcius : here : what's the matter <eos> messenger : the news is sir the volsces are in arms <eos> marcius : i am glad on 't : then we shall ha' means to vent our musty superfluity <eos> see our best elders <eos> first senator : marcius 'tis true that you have lately told us the volsces are in arms <eos> marcius : they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to 't <eos> i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he <eos> cominius : you have fought together <eos> marcius : were half to half the world by the ears and he <eos> upon my party i'ld revolt to make only my wars with him : he is a lion that i am proud to hunt <eos> first senator : then worthy marcius attend upon cominius to these wars <eos> cominius : it is your former promise <eos> marcius : sir it is and i am constant <eos> titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus' face <eos> what art thou stiff <eos> stand'st out <eos> titus : no caius marcius i'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other ere stay behind this business <eos> menenius : o true-bred <eos> first senator : your company to the capitol where i know our greatest friends attend us <eos> titus : cominius : noble marcius <eos> first senator : marcius : nay let them follow : the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners <eos> worshipful mutiners your valour puts well forth : pray follow <eos> sicinius : was ever man so proud as is this marcius <eos> brutus : he has no equal <eos> sicinius : when we were chosen tribunes for the people <eos> brutus : mark'd you his lip and eyes <eos> sicinius : nay <eos> but his taunts <eos> brutus : being moved he will not spare to gird the gods <eos> sicinius : be-mock the modest moon <eos> brutus : the present wars devour him : he is grown too proud to be so valiant <eos> sicinius : such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon : but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius <eos> brutus : fame at the which he aims in whom already he's well graced can not better be held nor more attain'd than by a place below the first : for what miscarries shall be the general's fault though he perform to the utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius 'o if he had borne the business <eos>' sicinius : besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius <eos> brutus : come : half all cominius' honours are to marcius <eos> though marcius earned them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not <eos> sicinius : let's hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action <eos> brutus : lets along <eos> first senator : so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed <eos> aufidius : is it not yours <eos> what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention <eos> 'tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words : i think i have the letter here yes here it is <eos> 'they have press'd a power but it is not known whether for east or west : the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumour'd cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither 'tis bent : most likely 'tis for you : consider of it <eos>' first senator : our army's in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us <eos> aufidius : nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil'd till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seem'd appear'd to rome <eos> by the discovery <eos> we shall be shorten'd in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot <eos> second senator : noble aufidius take your commission hie you to your bands : let us alone to guard corioli : if they set down before 's for the remove bring your army but i think you'll find they've not prepared for us <eos> aufidius : o doubt not that i speak from certainties <eos> nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward <eos> i leave your honours <eos> if we and caius marcius chance to meet 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more <eos> all : the gods assist you <eos> aufidius : and keep your honours safe <eos> first senator : farewell <eos> second senator : farewell <eos> all : farewell <eos> volumnia : i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort : if my son were my husband i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love <eos> when yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honour would become such a person <eos> that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame <eos> to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak <eos> i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man <eos> virgilia : but had he died in the business madam how then <eos> volumnia : then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue <eos> hear me profess sincerely : had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action <eos> gentlewoman : madam the lady valeria is come to visit you <eos> virgilia : beseech you give me leave to retire myself <eos> volumnia : indeed you shall not <eos> methinks i hear hither your husband's drum see him pluck aufidius down by the hair as children from a bear the volsces shunning him : methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus : 'come on you cowards <eos> you were got in fear though you were born in rome :' his bloody brow with his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow or all or lose his hire <eos> virgilia : his bloody brow <eos> o jupiter no blood <eos> volumnia : away you fool <eos> it more becomes a man than gilt his trophy : the breasts of hecuba when she did suckle hector look'd not lovelier than hector's forehead when it spit forth blood at grecian sword contemning <eos> tell valeria we are fit to bid her welcome <eos> virgilia : heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius <eos> volumnia : he'll beat aufidius 'head below his knee and tread upon his neck <eos> valeria : my ladies both good day to you <eos> volumnia : sweet madam <eos> virgilia : i am glad to see your ladyship <eos> valeria : how do you both <eos> you are manifest house-keepers <eos> what are you sewing here <eos> a fine spot in good faith <eos> how does your little son <eos> virgilia : i thank your ladyship well good madam <eos> volumnia : he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his school-master <eos> valeria : o' my word the father's son : i'll swear'tis a very pretty boy <eos> o' my troth i looked upon him o' wednesday half an hour together : has such a confirmed countenance <eos> i saw him run after a gilded butterfly : and when he caught it he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes and again catched it again or whether his fall enraged him or how 'twas he did so set his teeth and tear it o i warrant it how he mammocked it <eos> volumnia : one on 's father's moods <eos> valeria : indeed la 'tis a noble child <eos> virgilia : a crack madam <eos> valeria : come lay aside your stitchery i must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon <eos> virgilia : no good madam i will not out of doors <eos> valeria : not out of doors <eos> volumnia : she shall she shall <eos> virgilia : indeed no by your patience i'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars <eos> valeria : fie you confine yourself most unreasonably : come you must go visit the good lady that lies in <eos> virgilia : i will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers but i cannot go thither <eos> volumnia : why i pray you <eos> virgilia : 'tis not to save labour nor that i want love <eos> valeria : you would be another penelope : yet they say all the yarn she spun in ulysses' absence did but fill ithaca full of moths <eos> come i would your cambric were sensible as your finger that you might leave pricking it for pity <eos> come you shall go with us <eos> virgilia : no good madam pardon me indeed i will not forth <eos> valeria : in truth la go with me and i'll tell you excellent news of your husband <eos> virgilia : o good madam there can be none yet <eos> valeria : verily i do not jest with you there came news from him last night <eos> virgilia : indeed madam <eos> valeria : in earnest it's true i heard a senator speak it <eos> thus it is : the volsces have an army forth against whom cominius the general is gone with one part of our roman power : your lord and titus lartius are set down before their city corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars <eos> this is true on mine honour and so i pray go with us <eos> virgilia : give me excuse good madam i will obey you in every thing hereafter <eos> volumnia : let her alone lady : as she is now she will but disease our better mirth <eos> valeria : in troth i think she would <eos> fare you well then <eos> come good sweet lady <eos> prithee virgilia turn thy solemness out o' door <eos> and go along with us <eos> virgilia : no at a word madam indeed i must not <eos> i wish you much mirth <eos> valeria : well then farewell <eos> marcius : yonder comes news <eos> a wager they have met <eos> lartius : my horse to yours no <eos> marcius : 'tis done <eos> lartius : agreed <eos> marcius : say has our general met the enemy <eos> messenger : they lie in view but have not spoke as yet <eos> lartius : so the good horse is mine <eos> marcius : i'll buy him of you <eos> lartius : no i'll nor sell nor give him : lend you him i will for half a hundred years <eos> summon the town <eos> marcius : how far off lie these armies <eos> messenger : within this mile and half <eos> marcius : then shall we hear their 'larum and they ours <eos> now mars i prithee make us quick in work that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends <eos> come blow thy blast <eos> tutus aufidius is he within your walls <eos> first senator : no nor a man that fears you less than he that's lesser than a little <eos> hark <eos> our drums are bringing forth our youth <eos> we'll break our walls rather than they shall pound us up : our gates which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes they'll open of themselves <eos> hark you <eos> far off <eos> there is aufidius list what work he makes amongst your cloven army <eos> marcius : o they are at it <eos> lartius : their noise be our instruction <eos> ladders ho <eos> marcius : they fear us not but issue forth their city <eos> now put your shields before your hearts and fight with hearts more proof than shields <eos> advance brave titus : they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath <eos> come on my fellows : he that retires i'll take him for a volsce and he shall feel mine edge <eos> marcius : all the contagion of the south light on you you shames of rome <eos> you herd of <eos>boils and plagues plaster you o'er that you may be abhorr'd further than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile <eos> you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men how have you run from slaves that apes would beat <eos> pluto and hell <eos> all hurt behind backs red and faces pale with flight and agued fear <eos> mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven i'll leave the foe and make my wars on you : look to't : come on if you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches followed <eos> so now the gates are ope : now prove good seconds : 'tis for the followers fortune widens them not for the fliers : mark me and do the like <eos> first soldier : fool-hardiness not i <eos> second soldier : nor i <eos> first soldier : see they have shut him in <eos> all : to the pot i warrant him <eos> lartius : what is become of marcius <eos> all : slain sir doubtless <eos> first soldier : following the fliers at the very heels with them he enters who upon the sudden clapp'd to their gates : he is himself alone to answer all the city <eos> lartius : o noble fellow <eos> who sensibly outdares his senseless sword and when it bows stands up <eos> thou art left marcius : a carbuncle entire as big as thou art were not so rich a jewel <eos> thou wast a soldier even to cato's wish not fierce and terrible only in strokes but with thy grim looks and the thunder-like percussion of thy sounds thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world were feverous and did tremble <eos> first soldier : look sir <eos> lartius : o'tis marcius <eos> let's fetch him off or make remain alike <eos> first roman : this will i carry to rome <eos> second roman : and i this <eos> third roman : a murrain on't <eos> i took this for silver <eos> marcius : see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crack'd drachm <eos> cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up : down with them <eos> and hark what noise the general makes <eos> to him <eos> there is the man of my soul's hate aufidius piercing our romans : then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius <eos> lartius : worthy sir thou bleed'st thy exercise hath been too violent for a second course of fight <eos> marcius : sir praise me not my work hath yet not warm'd me : fare you well : the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me : to aufidius thus i will appear and fight <eos> lartius : now the fair goddess fortune fall deep in love with thee and her great charms misguide thy opposers' swords <eos> bold gentleman prosperity be thy page <eos> marcius : thy friend no less than those she placeth highest <eos> so farewell <eos> lartius : thou worthiest marcius <eos> go sound thy trumpet in the market-place call thither all the officers o' the town where they shall know our mind : away <eos> cominius : breathe you my friends : well fought we are come off like romans neither foolish in our stands nor cowardly in retire : believe me sirs we shall be charged again <eos> whiles we have struck by interims and conveying gusts we have heard the charges of our friends <eos> ye roman gods <eos> lead their successes as we wish our own that both our powers with smiling fronts encountering may give you thankful sacrifice <eos> thy news <eos> messenger : the citizens of corioli have issued and given to lartius and to marcius battle : i saw our party to their trenches driven and then i came away <eos> cominius : though thou speak'st truth methinks thou speak'st not well <eos> how long is't since <eos> messenger : above an hour my lord <eos> cominius : 'tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums : how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour and bring thy news so late <eos> messenger : spies of the volsces held me in chase that i was forced to wheel three or four miles about else had i sir half an hour since brought my report <eos> cominius : who's yonder that does appear as he were flay'd <eos> o gods he has the stamp of marcius and i have before-time seen him thus <eos> marcius : cominius : the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour more than i know the sound of marcius' tongue from every meaner man <eos> marcius : come i too late <eos> cominius : ay if you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own <eos> marcius : o let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i woo'd in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burn'd to bedward <eos> cominius : flower of warriors how is it with titus lartius <eos> marcius : as with a man busied about decrees : condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threatening the other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will <eos> cominius : where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches <eos> where is he <eos> call him hither <eos> marcius : let him alone he did inform the truth : but for our gentlemen the common file <eos>a plague <eos> tribunes for them <eos> <eos> the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they <eos> cominius : but how prevail'd you <eos> marcius : will the time serve to tell <eos> i do not think <eos> where is the enemy <eos> are you lords o' the field <eos> if not why cease you till you are so <eos> cominius : marcius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose <eos> marcius : how lies their battle <eos> know you on which side they have placed their men of trust <eos> cominius : as i guess marcius their bands i' the vaward are the antiates of their best trust o'er them aufidius their very heart of hope <eos> marcius : i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by the blood we have shed together by the vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour <eos> cominius : though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you yet dare i never deny your asking : take your choice of those that best can aid your action <eos> marcius : those are they that most are willing <eos> if any such be here <eos> as it were sin to doubt <eos>that love this painting wherein you see me smear'd if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country's dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow marcius <eos> o me alone <eos> make you a sword of me <eos> if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces <eos> none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his <eos> a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all : the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obey'd <eos> please you to march and four shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclined <eos> cominius : march on my fellows : make good this ostentation and you shall divide in all with us <eos> lartius : so let the ports be guarded : keep your duties as i have set them down <eos> if i do send dispatch those centuries to our aid : the rest will serve for a short holding : if we lose the field we cannot keep the town <eos> lieutenant : fear not our care sir <eos> lartius : hence and shut your gates upon's <eos> our guider come to the roman camp conduct us <eos> marcius : i'll fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promise-breaker <eos> aufidius : we hate alike : not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy <eos> fix thy foot <eos> marcius : let the first budger die the other's slave and the gods doom him after <eos> aufidius : if i fly marcius holloa me like a hare <eos> marcius : within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioli walls and made what work i pleased : 'tis not my blood wherein thou seest me mask'd for thy revenge wrench up thy power to the highest <eos> aufidius : wert thou the hector that was the whip of your bragg'd progeny thou shouldst not scape me here <eos> officious and not valiant you have shamed me in your condemned seconds <eos> cominius : if i should tell thee o'er this thy day's work thou'ldst not believe thy deeds : but i'll report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles where great patricians shall attend and shrug i' the end admire where ladies shall be frighted and gladly quaked hear more where the dull tribunes that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours shall say against their hearts 'we thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier <eos>' yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast having fully dined before <eos> lartius : o general here is the steed we the caparison : hadst thou beheld <eos> marcius : pray now no more : my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me <eos> i have done as you have done that's what i can induced as you have been that's for my country : he that has but effected his good will hath overta'en mine act <eos> cominius : you shall not be the grave of your deserving rome must know the value of her own : 'twere a concealment worse than a theft no less than a traducement to hide your doings and to silence that which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd would seem but modest : therefore i beseech you in sign of what you are not to reward what you have done <eos>before our army hear me <eos> marcius : i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves remember'd <eos> cominius : should they not well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude and tent themselves with death <eos> of all the horses whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all the treasure in this field achieved and city we render you the tenth to be ta'en forth before the common distribution at your only choice <eos> marcius : i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword : i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing <eos> marcius : may these same instruments which you profane never sound more <eos> when drums and trumpets shall i' the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of false-faced soothing <eos> when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk let him be made a coverture for the wars <eos> no more i say <eos> for that i have not wash'd my nose that bled or foil'd some debile wretch <eos> <eos> which without note here's many else have done <eos> you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies <eos> cominius : too modest are you more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly : by your patience if 'gainst yourself you be incensed we'll put you like one that means his proper harm in manacles then reason safely with you <eos> therefore be it known as to us to all the world that caius marcius wears this war's garland : in token of the which my noble steed known to the camp i give him with all his trim belonging and from this time for what he did before corioli call him with all the applause and clamour of the host caius marcius coriolanus <eos> bear the addition nobly ever <eos> all : caius marcius coriolanus <eos> coriolanus : i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no : howbeit i thank you <eos> i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to the fairness of my power <eos> cominius : so to our tent where ere we do repose us we will write to rome of our success <eos> you titus lartius must to corioli back : send us to rome the best with whom we may articulate for their own good and ours <eos> lartius : i shall my lord <eos> coriolanus : the gods begin to mock me <eos> i that now refused most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general <eos> cominius : take't 'tis yours <eos> what is't <eos> coriolanus : i sometime lay here in corioli at a poor man's house he used me kindly : he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity : i request you to give my poor host freedom <eos> cominius : o well begg'd <eos> were he the butcher of my son he should be free as is the wind <eos> deliver him titus <eos> lartius : marcius his name <eos> coriolanus : by jupiter <eos> forgot <eos> i am weary yea my memory is tired <eos> have we no wine here <eos> cominius : go we to our tent : the blood upon your visage dries 'tis time it should be look'd to : come <eos> aufidius : the town is ta'en <eos> first soldier : 'twill be deliver'd back on good condition <eos> aufidius : condition <eos> i would i were a roman for i cannot being a volsce be that i am <eos> condition <eos> what good condition can a treaty find i' the part that is at mercy <eos> five times marcius i have fought with thee : so often hast thou beat me and wouldst do so i think should we encounter as often as we eat <eos> by the elements if e'er again i meet him beard to beard he's mine or i am his : mine emulation hath not that honour in't it had for where i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword i'll potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him <eos> first soldier : he's the devil <eos> aufidius : bolder though not so subtle <eos> my valour's poison'd with only suffering stain by him for him shall fly out of itself : nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick nor fane nor capitol the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice embarquements all of fury shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst my hate to marcius : where i find him were it at home upon my brother's guard even there against the hospitable canon would i wash my fierce hand in's heart <eos> go you to the city learn how 'tis held and what they are that must be hostages for rome <eos> first soldier : will not you go <eos> aufidius : i am attended at the cypress grove : i pray you <eos> 'tis south the city mills <eos>bring me word thither how the world goes that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey <eos> first soldier : i shall sir <eos> menenius : the augurer tells me we shall have news to-night <eos> brutus : good or bad <eos> menenius : not according to the prayer of the people for they love not marcius <eos> sicinius : nature teaches beasts to know their friends <eos> menenius : pray you who does the wolf love <eos> sicinius : the lamb <eos> menenius : ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius <eos> brutus : he's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear <eos> menenius : he's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb <eos> you two are old men : tell me one thing that i shall ask you <eos> both : well sir <eos> menenius : in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance <eos> brutus : he's poor in no one fault but stored with all <eos> sicinius : especially in pride <eos> brutus : and topping all others in boasting <eos> menenius : this is strange now : do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o' the right-hand file <eos> do you <eos> both : why how are we censured <eos> menenius : because you talk of pride now <eos>will you not be angry <eos> both : well well sir well <eos> menenius : why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience : give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so <eos> you blame marcius for being proud <eos> brutus : we do it not alone sir <eos> menenius : i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single : your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone <eos> you talk of pride : o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves <eos> o that you could <eos> brutus : what then sir <eos> menenius : why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome <eos> sicinius : menenius you are known well enough too <eos> menenius : i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in't said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning : what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath <eos> meeting two such wealsmen as you are <eos>i cannot call you lycurguses <eos>if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it <eos> i can't say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables : and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces <eos> if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too <eos> what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too <eos> brutus : come sir come we know you well enough <eos> menenius : you know neither me yourselves nor any thing <eos> you are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs : you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience <eos> when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber-pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing : all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves <eos> you are a pair of strange ones <eos> brutus : come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol <eos> menenius : our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are <eos> when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an ass's pack- saddle <eos> yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen <eos> god-den to your worships : more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians : i will be bold to take my leave of you <eos> how now my as fair as noble ladies <eos>and the moon were she earthly no nobler <eos>whither do you follow your eyes so fast <eos> volumnia : honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for the love of juno let's go <eos> menenius : ha <eos> marcius coming home <eos> volumnia : ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous approbation <eos> menenius : take my cap jupiter and i thank thee <eos> hoo <eos> marcius coming home <eos> volumnia : nay'tis true <eos> volumnia : look here's a letter from him : the state hath another his wife another and i think there's one at home for you <eos> menenius : i will make my very house reel tonight : a letter for me <eos> virgilia : yes certain there's a letter for you i saw't <eos> menenius : a letter for me <eos> it gives me an estate of seven years' health in which time i will make a lip at the physician : the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse-drench <eos> is he not wounded <eos> he was wont to come home wounded <eos> virgilia : o no no no <eos> volumnia : o he is wounded i thank the gods for't <eos> menenius : so do i too if it be not too much : brings a' victory in his pocket <eos> the wounds become him <eos> volumnia : on's brows : menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland <eos> menenius : has he disciplined aufidius soundly <eos> volumnia : titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off <eos> menenius : and 'twas time for him too i'll warrant him that : an he had stayed by him i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold that's in them <eos> is the senate possessed of this <eos> volumnia : good ladies let's go <eos> yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war : he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly valeria : in troth there's wondrous things spoke of him <eos> menenius : wondrous <eos> ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing <eos> virgilia : the gods grant them true <eos> volumnia : true <eos> pow wow <eos> menenius : true <eos> i'll be sworn they are true <eos> where is he wounded <eos> god save your good worships <eos> marcius is coming home : he has more cause to be proud <eos> where is he wounded <eos> volumnia : i' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place <eos> he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i' the body <eos> menenius : one i' the neck and two i' the thigh <eos>there's nine that i know <eos> volumnia : he had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds upon him <eos> menenius : now it's twenty-seven : every gash was an enemy's grave <eos> hark <eos> the trumpets <eos> volumnia : these are the ushers of marcius : before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears : death that dark spirit in 's nervy arm doth lie which being advanced declines and then men die <eos> herald : know rome that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates : where he hath won with fame a name to caius marcius these in honour follows coriolanus <eos> welcome to rome renowned coriolanus <eos> all : welcome to rome renowned coriolanus <eos> coriolanus : no more of this it does offend my heart : pray now no more <eos> cominius : look sir your mother <eos> coriolanus : o you have i know petition'd all the gods for my prosperity <eos> volumnia : nay my good soldier up my gentle marcius worthy caius and by deed-achieving honour newly named <eos> what is it <eos> <eos>coriolanus must i call thee <eos> <eos> but o thy wife <eos> coriolanus : my gracious silence hail <eos> wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin'd home that weep'st to see me triumph <eos> ay my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons <eos> menenius : now the gods crown thee <eos> coriolanus : and live you yet <eos> o my sweet lady pardon <eos> volumnia : i know not where to turn : o welcome home : and welcome general : and ye're welcome all <eos> menenius : a hundred thousand welcomes <eos> i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy <eos> welcome <eos> a curse begin at very root on's heart that is not glad to see thee <eos> you are three that rome should dote on : yet by the faith of men we have some old crab-trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish <eos> yet welcome warriors : we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly <eos> cominius : ever right <eos> coriolanus : menenius ever ever <eos> herald : give way there and go on <eos> coriolanus : volumnia : i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy : only there's one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee <eos> coriolanus : know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs <eos> cominius : on to the capitol <eos> brutus : all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him : your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him : the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck clambering the walls to eye him : stalls bulks windows are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges horsed with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him : seld-shown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station : or veil'd dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus' burning kisses : such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture <eos> sicinius : on the sudden i warrant him consul <eos> brutus : then our office may during his power go sleep <eos> sicinius : he cannot temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won <eos> brutus : in that there's comfort <eos> sicinius : doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to do't <eos> brutus : i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i' the market-place nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths <eos> sicinius : 'tis right <eos> brutus : it was his word : o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles <eos> sicinius : i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution <eos> brutus : 'tis most like he will <eos> sicinius : it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction <eos> brutus : so it must fall out to him or our authorities <eos> for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that to's power he would have made them mules silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them <eos> sicinius : this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people <eos>which time shall not want if he be put upon 't and that's as easy as to set dogs on sheep <eos>will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever <eos> brutus : what's the matter <eos> messenger : you are sent for to the capitol <eos> 'tis thought that marcius shall be consul : i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak : matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he pass'd : the nobles bended as to jove's statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts : i never saw the like <eos> brutus : let's to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for the time but hearts for the event <eos> sicinius : have with you <eos> first officer : come come they are almost here <eos> how many stand for consulships <eos> second officer : three they say : but 'tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it <eos> first officer : that's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common people <eos> second officer : faith there had been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore : so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground : therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't <eos> first officer : if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm : but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite <eos> now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love <eos> second officer : he hath deserved worthily of his country : and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report : but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it <eos> first officer : no more of him he is a worthy man : make way they are coming <eos> menenius : having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after-meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country : therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well-found successes to report a little of that worthy work perform'd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself <eos> first senator : speak good cominius : leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our state's defective for requital than we to stretch it out <eos> masters o' the people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here <eos> sicinius : we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly <eos> brutus : which the rather we shall be blest to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at <eos> menenius : that's off that's off i would you rather had been silent <eos> please you to hear cominius speak <eos> brutus : most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it <eos> menenius : he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow <eos> worthy cominius speak <eos> nay keep your place <eos> first senator : sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done <eos> coriolanus : your horror's pardon : i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them <eos> brutus : sir i hope my words disbench'd you not <eos> coriolanus : no sir : yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words <eos> you soothed not therefore hurt not : but your people i love them as they weigh <eos> menenius : pray now sit down <eos> coriolanus : i had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monster'd <eos> menenius : masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter <eos> that's thousand to one good one <eos>when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one on's ears to hear it <eos> proceed cominius <eos> cominius : i shall lack voice : the deeds of coriolanus should not be utter'd feebly <eos> it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver : if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised <eos> at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others : our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him : be bestrid an o'er-press'd roman and i' the consul's view slew three opposers : tarquin's self he met and struck him on his knee : in that day's feats when he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man i' the field and for his meed was brow-bound with the oak <eos> his pupil age man-enter'd thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurch'd all swords of the garland <eos> for this last before and in corioli let me say i cannot speak him home : he stopp'd the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport : as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obey'd and fell below his stem : his sword death's stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries : alone he enter'd the mortal gate of the city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet : now all's his : when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking o'er the lives of men as if 'twere a perpetual spoil : and till we call'd both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting <eos> menenius : worthy man <eos> first senator : he cannot but with measure fit the honours which we devise him <eos> cominius : our spoils he kick'd at and look'd upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world : he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it <eos> menenius : he's right noble : let him be call'd for <eos> first senator : call coriolanus <eos> officer : he doth appear <eos> menenius : the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul <eos> coriolanus : i do owe them still my life and services <eos> menenius : it then remains that you do speak to the people <eos> coriolanus : i do beseech you let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage : please you that i may pass this doing <eos> sicinius : sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony <eos> menenius : put them not to't : pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form <eos> coriolanus : it is apart that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people <eos> brutus : mark you that <eos> coriolanus : to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only <eos> menenius : do not stand upon't <eos> we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them : and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour <eos> senators : to coriolanus come all joy and honour <eos> brutus : you see how he intends to use the people <eos> sicinius : may they perceive's intent <eos> he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give <eos> brutus : come we'll inform them of our proceedings here : on the marketplace i know they do attend us <eos> first citizen : once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him <eos> second citizen : we may sir if we will <eos> third citizen : we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them <eos> ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude : of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members <eos> first citizen : and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude <eos> third citizen : we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured : and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' the compass <eos> second citizen : think you so <eos> which way do you judge my wit would fly <eos> third citizen : nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's will'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head but if it were at liberty 'twould sure southward <eos> second citizen : why that way <eos> third citizen : to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife <eos> second citizen : you are never without your tricks : you may you may <eos> third citizen : are you all resolved to give your voices <eos> but that's no matter the greater part carries it <eos> i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man <eos> here he comes and in the gown of humility : mark his behavior <eos> we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes <eos> he's to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues : therefore follow me and i direct you how you shall go by him <eos> all : content content <eos> menenius : o sir you are not right : have you not known the worthiest men have done't <eos> coriolanus : what must i say <eos> 'i pray sir' <eos>plague upon't <eos> i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace : <eos>'look sir my wounds <eos> i got them in my country's service when some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran from the noise of our own drums <eos>' menenius : o me the gods <eos> you must not speak of that : you must desire them to think upon you <eos> coriolanus : think upon me <eos> hang 'em <eos> i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by 'em <eos> menenius : you'll mar all : i'll leave you : pray you speak to 'em i pray you in wholesome manner <eos> coriolanus : bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean <eos> so here comes a brace <eos> you know the cause air of my standing here <eos> third citizen : we do sir tell us what hath brought you to't <eos> coriolanus : mine own desert <eos> second citizen : your own desert <eos> coriolanus : ay but not mine own desire <eos> third citizen : how not your own desire <eos> coriolanus : no sir'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging <eos> third citizen : you must think if we give you any thing we hope to gain by you <eos> coriolanus : well then i pray your price o' the consulship <eos> first citizen : the price is to ask it kindly <eos> coriolanus : kindly <eos> sir i pray let me ha't : i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private <eos> your good voice sir what say you <eos> second citizen : you shall ha' it worthy sir <eos> coriolanus : a match sir <eos> there's in all two worthy voices begged <eos> i have your alms : adieu <eos> third citizen : but this is something odd <eos> second citizen : an 'twere to give again <eos>but 'tis no matter <eos> coriolanus : pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown <eos> fourth citizen : you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly <eos> coriolanus : your enigma <eos> fourth citizen : you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people <eos> coriolanus : you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love <eos> i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle : and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers <eos> therefore beseech you i may be consul <eos> fifth citizen : we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily <eos> fourth citizen : you have received many wounds for your country <eos> coriolanus : i will not seal your knowledge with showing them <eos> i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further <eos> both citizens : the gods give you joy sir heartily <eos> coriolanus : most sweet voices <eos> better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve <eos> why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches <eos> custom calls me to't : what custom wills in all things should we do't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to o'er-peer <eos> rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus <eos> i am half through the one part suffer'd the other will i do <eos> here come more voices <eos> your voices : for your voices i have fought watch'd for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices : indeed i would be consul <eos> sixth citizen : he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest man's voice <eos> seventh citizen : therefore let him be consul : the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people <eos> all citizens : amen amen <eos> god save thee noble consul <eos> coriolanus : worthy voices <eos> menenius : you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice : remains that in the official marks invested you anon do meet the senate <eos> coriolanus : is this done <eos> sicinius : the custom of request you have discharged : the people do admit you and are summon'd to meet anon upon your approbation <eos> coriolanus : where <eos> at the senate-house <eos> sicinius : there coriolanus <eos> coriolanus : may i change these garments <eos> sicinius : you may sir <eos> coriolanus : that i'll straight do and knowing myself again repair to the senate-house <eos> menenius : i'll keep you company <eos> will you along <eos> brutus : we stay here for the people <eos> sicinius : fare you well <eos> he has it now and by his looks methink 'tis warm at 's heart <eos> brutus : with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds <eos> will you dismiss the people <eos> sicinius : how now my masters <eos> have you chose this man <eos> first citizen : he has our voices sir <eos> brutus : we pray the gods he may deserve your loves <eos> second citizen : amen sir : to my poor unworthy notice he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices <eos> third citizen : certainly he flouted us downright <eos> first citizen : no'tis his kind of speech : he did not mock us <eos> second citizen : not one amongst us save yourself but says he used us scornfully : he should have show'd us his marks of merit wounds received for's country <eos> sicinius : why so he did i am sure <eos> citizens : no no no man saw 'em <eos> third citizen : he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn 'i would be consul' says he : 'aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore <eos>' when we granted that here was 'i thank you for your voices : thank you : your most sweet voices : now you have left your voices i have no further with you <eos>' was not this mockery <eos> sicinius : why either were you ignorant to see't or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices <eos> brutus : could you not have told him as you were lesson'd when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i' the body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o' the state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves <eos> you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord <eos> sicinius : thus to have said as you were fore-advised had touch'd his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluck'd either his gracious promise which you might as cause had call'd you up have held him to or else it would have gall'd his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have ta'en the advantage of his choler and pass'd him unelected <eos> brutus : did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush <eos> why had your bodies no heart among you <eos> or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment <eos> sicinius : have you ere now denied the asker <eos> and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your sued-for tongues <eos> third citizen : he's not confirm'd we may deny him yet <eos> second citizen : and will deny him : i'll have five hundred voices of that sound <eos> first citizen : i twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em <eos> brutus : get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so <eos> sicinius : let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you the apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you <eos> brutus : lay a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him <eos> sicinius : say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul : lay the fault on us <eos> brutus : ay spare us not <eos> say we read lectures to you <eos> how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o' the marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numa's daughter's son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our beat water brought by conduits hither and twice being was his great ancestor <eos> sicinius : one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances : but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that he's your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation <eos> brutus : say you ne'er had done't <eos> harp on that still <eos>but by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to the capitol <eos> all : we will so : almost all repent in their election <eos> brutus : let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater : if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger <eos> sicinius : to the capitol come : we will be there before the stream o' the people and this shall seem as partly 'tis their own which we have goaded onward <eos> coriolanus : tullus aufidius then had made new head <eos> lartius : he had my lord and that it was which caused our swifter composition <eos> coriolanus : so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road <eos> upon's again <eos> cominius : they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again <eos> coriolanus : saw you aufidius <eos> lartius : on safe-guard he came to me and did curse against the volsces for they had so vilely yielded the town : he is retired to antium <eos> coriolanus : spoke he of me <eos> lartius : he did my lord <eos> coriolanus : how <eos> what <eos> lartius : how often he had met you sword to sword that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution so he might be call'd your vanquisher <eos> coriolanus : at antium lives he <eos> lartius : at antium <eos> coriolanus : i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully <eos> welcome home <eos> behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o' the common mouth : i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance <eos> sicinius : pass no further <eos> coriolanus : ha <eos> what is that <eos> brutus : it will be dangerous to go on : no further <eos> coriolanus : what makes this change <eos> menenius : the matter <eos> cominius : hath he not pass'd the noble and the common <eos> brutus : cominius no <eos> coriolanus : have i had children's voices <eos> first senator : tribunes give way he shall to the market-place <eos> brutus : the people are incensed against him <eos> sicinius : stop or all will fall in broil <eos> coriolanus : are these your herd <eos> must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues <eos> what are your offices <eos> you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth <eos> have you not set them on <eos> menenius : be calm be calm <eos> coriolanus : it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility : suffer't and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled <eos> brutus : call't not a plot : the people cry you mock'd them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repined scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them time-pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness <eos> coriolanus : why this was known before <eos> brutus : not to them all <eos> coriolanus : have you inform'd them sithence <eos> brutus : how <eos> i inform them <eos> coriolanus : you are like to do such business <eos> brutus : not unlike each way to better yours <eos> coriolanus : why then should i be consul <eos> by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune <eos> sicinius : you show too much of that for which the people stir : if you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune <eos> menenius : let's be calm <eos> cominius : the people are abused set on <eos> this paltering becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely i' the plain way of his merit <eos> coriolanus : tell me of corn <eos> this was my speech and i will speak't again <eos> menenius : not now not now <eos> first senator : not in this heat sir now <eos> coriolanus : now as i live i will <eos> my nobler friends i crave their pardons : for the mutable rank-scented many let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves : i say again in soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd by mingling them with us the honour'd number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars <eos> menenius : well no more <eos> first senator : no more words we beseech you <eos> coriolanus : how <eos> no more <eos> as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tatter us yet sought the very way to catch them <eos> brutus : you speak o' the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity <eos> sicinius : 'twere well we let the people know't <eos> menenius : what what <eos> his choler <eos> coriolanus : choler <eos> were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove 'twould be my mind <eos> sicinius : it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further <eos> coriolanus : shall remain <eos> hear you this triton of the minnows <eos> mark you his absolute 'shall' <eos> cominius : 'twas from the canon <eos> coriolanus : 'shall' <eos> o good but most unwise patricians <eos> why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory 'shall' being but the horn and noise o' the monster's wants not spirit to say he'll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his <eos> if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity <eos> if you are learn'd be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you <eos> you are plebeians if they be senators : and they are no less when both your voices blended the great'st taste most palates theirs <eos> they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his 'shall' his popular 'shall' against a graver bench than ever frown in greece <eos> by jove himself <eos> it makes the consuls base : and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other <eos> cominius : well on to the market-place <eos> coriolanus : whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o' the storehouse gratis as 'twas used sometime in greece <eos> menenius : well well no more of that <eos> coriolanus : though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourish'd disobedience fed the ruin of the state <eos> brutus : why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice <eos> coriolanus : i'll give my reasons more worthier than their voices <eos> they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured that ne'er did service for't : being press'd to the war even when the navel of the state was touch'd they would not thread the gates <eos> this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis <eos> being i' the war their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd most valour spoke not for them : the accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the motive of our so frank donation <eos> well what then <eos> how shall this bisson multitude digest the senate's courtesy <eos> let deeds express what's like to be their words : 'we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands <eos>' thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles <eos> menenius : come enough <eos> brutus : enough with over-measure <eos> coriolanus : no take more : what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal <eos> this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance <eos>it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness : purpose so barr'd it follows nothing is done to purpose <eos> therefore beseech you <eos> you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change on't that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that's sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison : your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become't not having the power to do the good it would for the in which doth control't <eos> brutus : has said enough <eos> sicinius : has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do <eos> coriolanus : thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee <eos> what should the people do with these bald tribunes <eos> on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench : in a rebellion when what's not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen : in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i' the dust <eos> brutus : manifest treason <eos> sicinius : this a consul <eos> no <eos> brutus : the aediles ho <eos> let him be apprehended <eos> sicinius : go call the people : in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator a foe to the public weal : obey i charge thee and follow to thine answer <eos> coriolanus : hence old goat <eos> senators &c : we'll surety him <eos> cominius : aged sir hands off <eos> coriolanus : hence rotten thing <eos> or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments <eos> sicinius : help ye citizens <eos> menenius : on both sides more respect <eos> sicinius : here's he that would take from you all your power <eos> brutus : seize him aediles <eos> citizens : down with him <eos> down with him <eos> senators &c : weapons weapons weapons <eos> 'tribunes <eos>' 'patricians <eos>' 'citizens <eos>' 'what ho <eos>' 'sicinius <eos>' 'brutus <eos>' 'coriolanus <eos>' 'citizens <eos>' 'peace peace peace <eos>' 'stay hold peace <eos>' menenius : what is about to be <eos> i am out of breath confusion's near i cannot speak <eos> you tribunes to the people <eos> coriolanus patience <eos> speak good sicinius <eos> sicinius : hear me people peace <eos> citizens : let's hear our tribune : peace speak speak speak <eos> sicinius : you are at point to lose your liberties : marcius would have all from you marcius whom late you have named for consul <eos> menenius : fie fie fie <eos> this is the way to kindle not to quench <eos> first senator : to unbuild the city and to lay all flat <eos> sicinius : what is the city but the people <eos> citizens : true the people are the city <eos> brutus : by the consent of all we were establish'd the people's magistrates <eos> citizens : you so remain <eos> menenius : and so are like to do <eos> cominius : that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin <eos> sicinius : this deserves death <eos> brutus : or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it <eos> we do here pronounce upon the part o' the people in whose power we were elected theirs marcius is worthy of present death <eos> sicinius : therefore lay hold of him bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him <eos> brutus : aediles seize him <eos> citizens : yield marcius yield <eos> menenius : hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word <eos> aedile : peace peace <eos> menenius : brutus : sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous where the disease is violent <eos> lay hands upon him and bear him to the rock <eos> coriolanus : no i'll die here <eos> there's some among you have beheld me fighting : come try upon yourselves what you have seen me <eos> menenius : down with that sword <eos> tribunes withdraw awhile <eos> brutus : lay hands upon him <eos> cominius : help marcius help you that be noble help him young and old <eos> citizens : down with him down with him <eos> menenius : go get you to your house be gone away <eos> all will be naught else <eos> second senator : get you gone <eos> cominius : stand fast we have as many friends as enemies <eos> menenius : sham it be put to that <eos> first senator : the gods forbid <eos> i prithee noble friend home to thy house leave us to cure this cause <eos> menenius : for 'tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself : be gone beseech you <eos> cominius : come sir along with us <eos> coriolanus : i would they were barbarians <eos>as they are though in rome litter'd <eos>not romans <eos>as they are not though calved i' the porch o' the capitol <eos> menenius : be gone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another <eos> coriolanus : on fair ground i could beat forty of them <eos> cominius : i could myself take up a brace o' the best of them yea the two tribunes : but now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic and manhood is call'd foolery when it stands against a falling fabric <eos> will you hence before the tag return <eos> whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and o'erbear what they are used to bear <eos> menenius : pray you be gone : i'll try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little : this must be patch'd with cloth of any colour <eos> cominius : nay come away <eos> a patrician : this man has marr'd his fortune <eos> menenius : his nature is too noble for the world : he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for's power to thunder <eos> his heart's his mouth : what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death <eos> here's goodly work <eos> second patrician : i would they were abed <eos> menenius : i would they were in tiber <eos> what the vengeance <eos> could he not speak 'em fair <eos> sicinius : where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself <eos> menenius : you worthy tribunes <eos> sicinius : he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands : he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought <eos> first citizen : he shall well know the noble tribunes are the people's mouths and we their hands <eos> citizens : he shall sure on't <eos> menenius : sir sir <eos> sicinius : peace <eos> menenius : do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant <eos> sicinius : sir how comes't that you have holp to make this rescue <eos> menenius : hear me speak : as i do know the consul's worthiness so can i name his faults <eos> sicinius : consul <eos> what consul <eos> menenius : the consul coriolanus <eos> brutus : he consul <eos> citizens : no no no no no <eos> menenius : if by the tribunes' leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time <eos> sicinius : speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor : to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death : therefore it is decreed he dies to-night <eos> menenius : now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enroll'd in jove's own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own <eos> sicinius : he's a disease that must be cut away <eos> menenius : o he's a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy <eos> what has he done to rome that's worthy death <eos> killing our enemies the blood he hath lost <eos> which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce <eos>he dropp'd it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that do't and suffer it a brand to the end o' the world <eos> sicinius : this is clean kam <eos> brutus : merely awry : when he did love his country it honour'd him <eos> menenius : the service of the foot being once gangrened is not then respected for what before it was <eos> brutus : we'll hear no more <eos> pursue him to his house and pluck him thence : lest his infection being of catching nature spread further <eos> menenius : one word more one word <eos> this tiger-footed rage when it shall find the harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds to's heels <eos> proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans <eos> brutus : if it were so <eos> sicinius : what do ye talk <eos> have we not had a taste of his obedience <eos> our aediles smote <eos> ourselves resisted <eos> come <eos> menenius : consider this : he has been bred i' the wars since he could draw a sword and is ill school'd in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction <eos> give me leave i'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril <eos> first senator : noble tribunes it is the humane way : the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning <eos> sicinius : noble menenius be you then as the people's officer <eos> masters lay down your weapons <eos> brutus : go not home <eos> sicinius : meet on the market-place <eos> we'll attend you there : where if you bring not marcius we'll proceed in our first way <eos> menenius : i'll bring him to you <eos> let me desire your company : he must come or what is worst will follow <eos> first senator : pray you let's to him <eos> coriolanus : let them puff all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them <eos> a patrician : you do the nobler <eos> coriolanus : i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war <eos> i talk of you : why did you wish me milder <eos> would you have me false to my nature <eos> rather say i play the man i am <eos> volumnia : o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out <eos> coriolanus : let go <eos> volumnia : you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not show'd them how ye were disposed ere they lack'd power to cross you <eos> coriolanus : let them hang <eos> a patrician : ay and burn too <eos> menenius : come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it <eos> first senator : there's no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish <eos> volumnia : pray be counsell'd : i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage <eos> menenius : well said noble woman <eos> before he should thus stoop to the herd but that the violent fit o' the time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear <eos> coriolanus : what must i do <eos> menenius : return to the tribunes <eos> coriolanus : well what then <eos> what then <eos> menenius : repent what you have spoke <eos> coriolanus : for them <eos> i cannot do it to the gods must i then do't to them <eos> volumnia : you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak <eos> i have heard you say honour and policy like unsever'd friends i' the war do grow together : grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by the other lose that they combine not there <eos> coriolanus : tush tush <eos> menenius : a good demand <eos> volumnia : if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request <eos> coriolanus : why force you this <eos> volumnia : because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth <eos> now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood <eos> i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour : i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin <eos> menenius : noble lady <eos> come go with us speak fair : you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past <eos> volumnia : i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretch'd it <eos>here be with them <eos> thy knee bussing the stones <eos>for in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the ears <eos>waving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling : or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person <eos> menenius : this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being ask'd as free as words to little purpose <eos> volumnia : prithee now go and be ruled : although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower <eos> here is cominius <eos> cominius : i have been i' the market-place and sir'tis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence : all's in anger <eos> menenius : only fair speech <eos> cominius : i think 'twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit <eos> volumnia : he must and will prithee now say you will and go about it <eos> coriolanus : must i go show them my unbarbed sconce <eos> must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear <eos> well i will do't : yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throw't against the wind <eos> to the market-place <eos> you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life <eos> cominius : come come we'll prompt you <eos> volumnia : i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before <eos> coriolanus : well i must do't : away my disposition and possess me some harlot's spirit <eos> my throat of war be turn'd which quired with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep <eos> the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up the glasses of my sight <eos> a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms <eos> i will not do't lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness <eos> volumnia : at thy choice then : to beg of thee it is my more dishonour than thou of them <eos> come all to ruin let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou <eos> do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me but owe thy pride thyself <eos> coriolanus : pray be content : mother i am going to the market-place chide me no more <eos> i'll mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome <eos> look i am going : commend me to my wife <eos> i'll return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i' the way of flattery further <eos> volumnia : do your will <eos> cominius : away <eos> the tribunes do attend you : arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepared with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet <eos> coriolanus : the word is 'mildly <eos>' pray you let us go : let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour <eos> menenius : ay but mildly <eos> coriolanus : well mildly be it then <eos> mildly <eos> brutus : in this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power : if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people and that the spoil got on the antiates was ne'er distributed <eos> what will he come <eos> aedile : he's coming <eos> brutus : how accompanied <eos> aedile : with old menenius and those senators that always favour'd him <eos> sicinius : have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll <eos> aedile : i have 'tis ready <eos> sicinius : have you collected them by tribes <eos> aedile : i have <eos> sicinius : assemble presently the people hither and when they bear me say 'it shall be so i' the right and strength o' the commons' be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry 'fine' if death cry 'death <eos>' insisting on the old prerogative and power i' the truth o' the cause <eos> aedile : i shall inform them <eos> brutus : and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence <eos> aedile : very well <eos> sicinius : make them be strong and ready for this hint when we shall hap to give 't them <eos> brutus : go about it <eos> put him to choler straight : he hath been used ever to conquer and to have his worth of contradiction : being once chafed he cannot be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks what's in his heart and that is there which looks with us to break his neck <eos> sicinius : well here he comes <eos> menenius : calmly i do beseech you <eos> coriolanus : ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece will bear the knave by the volume <eos> the honour'd gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men <eos> plant love among 's <eos> throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war <eos> first senator : amen amen <eos> menenius : a noble wish <eos> sicinius : draw near ye people <eos> aedile : list to your tribunes <eos> audience : peace i say <eos> coriolanus : first hear me speak <eos> both tribunes : well say <eos> peace ho <eos> coriolanus : shall i be charged no further than this present <eos> must all determine here <eos> sicinius : i do demand if you submit you to the people's voices allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you <eos> coriolanus : i am content <eos> menenius : lo citizens he says he is content : the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i' the holy churchyard <eos> coriolanus : scratches with briers scars to move laughter only <eos> menenius : consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier : do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you <eos> cominius : well well no more <eos> coriolanus : what is the matter that being pass'd for consul with full voice i am so dishonour'd that the very hour you take it off again <eos> sicinius : answer to us <eos> coriolanus : say then : 'tis true i ought so <eos> sicinius : we charge you that you have contrived to take from rome all season'd office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people <eos> coriolanus : how <eos> traitor <eos> menenius : nay temperately your promise <eos> coriolanus : the fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people <eos> call me their traitor <eos> thou injurious tribune <eos> within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hand clutch'd as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say 'thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods <eos> sicinius : mark you this people <eos> citizens : to the rock to the rock with him <eos> sicinius : peace <eos> we need not put new matter to his charge : what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves the extremest death <eos> brutus : but since he hath served well for rome <eos> coriolanus : what do you prate of service <eos> brutus : i talk of that that know it <eos> coriolanus : you <eos> menenius : is this the promise that you made your mother <eos> cominius : know i pray you <eos> coriolanus : i know no further : let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile raying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor cheque my courage for what they can give to have't with saying 'good morrow <eos>' sicinius : for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it in the name o' the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates : i' the people's name i say it shall be so <eos> citizens : it shall be so it shall be so let him away : he's banish'd and it shall be so <eos> cominius : hear me my masters and my common friends <eos> sicinius : he's sentenced no more hearing <eos> cominius : let me speak : i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies' marks upon me <eos> i do love my country's good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wife's estimate her womb's increase and treasure of my loins then if i would speak that <eos> sicinius : we know your drift : speak what <eos> brutus : there's no more to be said but he is banish'd as enemy to the people and his country : it shall be so <eos> citizens : it shall be so it shall be so <eos> coriolanus : you common cry of curs <eos> whose breath i hate as reek o' the rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty <eos> let every feeble rumour shake your hearts <eos> your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair <eos> have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making not reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows <eos> despising for you the city thus i turn my back : there is a world elsewhere <eos> aedile : the people's enemy is gone is gone <eos> citizens : our enemy is banish'd <eos> he is gone <eos> hoo <eos> hoo <eos> sicinius : go see him out at gates and follow him as he hath followed you with all despite give him deserved vexation <eos> let a guard attend us through the city <eos> citizens : come come let's see him out at gates come <eos> the gods preserve our noble tribunes <eos> come <eos> coriolanus : come leave your tears : a brief farewell : the beast with many heads butts me away <eos> nay mother where is your ancient courage <eos> you were used to say extremity was the trier of spirits that common chances common men could bear that when the sea was calm all boats alike show'd mastership in floating fortune's blows when most struck home being gentle wounded craves a noble cunning : you were used to load me with precepts that would make invincible the heart that conn'd them <eos> virgilia : o heavens <eos> o heavens <eos> coriolanus : nay <eos> prithee woman <eos> volumnia : now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome and occupations perish <eos> coriolanus : what what what <eos> i shall be loved when i am lack'd <eos> nay mother <eos> resume that spirit when you were wont to say if you had been the wife of hercules six of his labours you'ld have done and saved your husband so much sweat <eos> cominius droop not adieu <eos> farewell my wife my mother : i'll do well yet <eos> thou old and true menenius thy tears are salter than a younger man's and venomous to thine eyes <eos> my sometime general i have seen thee stem and thou hast oft beheld heart-hardening spectacles tell these sad women 'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes as 'tis to laugh at 'em <eos> my mother you wot well my hazards still have been your solace : and believe't not lightly <eos>though i go alone like to a lonely dragon that his fen makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen <eos>your son will or exceed the common or be caught with cautelous baits and practise <eos> volumnia : my first son <eos> whither wilt thou go <eos> take good cominius with thee awhile : determine on some course more than a wild exposture to each chance that starts i' the way before thee <eos> coriolanus : o the gods <eos> cominius : i'll follow thee a month devise with thee where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us and we of thee : so if the time thrust forth a cause for thy repeal we shall not send o'er the vast world to seek a single man and lose advantage which doth ever cool i' the absence of the needer <eos> coriolanus : fare ye well : thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one that's yet unbruised : bring me but out at gate <eos> come my sweet wife my dearest mother and my friends of noble touch when i am forth bid me farewell and smile <eos> i pray you come <eos> while i remain above the ground you shall hear from me still and never of me aught but what is like me formerly <eos> menenius : that's worthily as any ear can hear <eos> come let's not weep <eos> if i could shake off but one seven years from these old arms and legs by the good gods i'ld with thee every foot <eos> coriolanus : give me thy hand : come <eos> sicinius : bid them all home he's gone and we'll no further <eos> the nobility are vex'd whom we see have sided in his behalf <eos> brutus : now we have shown our power let us seem humbler after it is done than when it was a-doing <eos> sicinius : bid them home : say their great enemy is gone and they stand in their ancient strength <eos> brutus : dismiss them home <eos> here comes his mother <eos> sicinius : let's not meet her <eos> brutus : why <eos> sicinius : they say she's mad <eos> brutus : they have ta'en note of us : keep on your way <eos> volumnia : o ye're well met : the hoarded plague o' the gods requite your love <eos> menenius : peace peace be not so loud <eos> volumnia : if that i could for weeping you should hear <eos> nay and you shall hear some <eos> will you be gone <eos> virgilia : sicinius : are you mankind <eos> volumnia : ay fool is that a shame <eos> note but this fool <eos> was not a man my father <eos> hadst thou foxship to banish him that struck more blows for rome than thou hast spoken words <eos> sicinius : o blessed heavens <eos> volumnia : more noble blows than ever thou wise words and for rome's good <eos> i'll tell thee what yet go : nay but thou shalt stay too : i would my son were in arabia and thy tribe before him his good sword in his hand <eos> sicinius : what then <eos> virgilia : what then <eos> he'ld make an end of thy posterity <eos> volumnia : bastards and all <eos> good man the wounds that he does bear for rome <eos> menenius : come come peace <eos> sicinius : i would he had continued to his country as he began and not unknit himself the noble knot he made <eos> brutus : i would he had <eos> volumnia : 'i would he had' <eos> 'twas you incensed the rabble : cats that can judge as fitly of his worth as i can of those mysteries which heaven will not have earth to know <eos> brutus : pray let us go <eos> volumnia : now pray sir get you gone : you have done a brave deed <eos> ere you go hear this : <eos> as far as doth the capitol exceed the meanest house in rome so far my son <eos> this lady's husband here this do you see <eos> whom you have banish'd does exceed you all <eos> brutus : well well we'll leave you <eos> sicinius : why stay we to be baited with one that wants her wits <eos> volumnia : take my prayers with you <eos> i would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses <eos> could i meet 'em but once a-day it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to't <eos> menenius : you have told them home and by my troth you have cause <eos> you'll sup with me <eos> volumnia : anger's my meat i sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding <eos> come let's go : leave this faint puling and lament as i do in anger juno-like <eos> come come come <eos> menenius : fie fie fie <eos> roman : i know you well sir and you know me : your name i think is adrian <eos> volsce : it is so sir : truly i have forgot you <eos> roman : i am a roman and my services are as you are against 'em : know you me yet <eos> volsce : nicanor <eos> no <eos> roman : the same sir <eos> volsce : you had more beard when i last saw you but your favour is well approved by your tongue <eos> what's the news in rome <eos> i have a note from the volscian state to find you out there : you have well saved me a day's journey <eos> roman : there hath been in rome strange insurrections the people against the senators patricians and nobles <eos> volsce : hath been <eos> is it ended then <eos> our state thinks not so : they are in a most warlike preparation and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division <eos> roman : the main blaze of it is past but a small thing would make it flame again : for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever <eos> this lies glowing i can tell you and is almost mature for the violent breaking out <eos> volsce : coriolanus banished <eos> roman : banished sir <eos> volsce : you will be welcome with this intelligence nicanor <eos> roman : the day serves well for them now <eos> i have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fallen out with her husband <eos> your noble tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars his great opposer coriolanus being now in no request of his country <eos> volsce : he cannot choose <eos> i am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you : you have ended my business and i will merrily accompany you home <eos> roman : i shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from rome all tending to the good of their adversaries <eos> have you an army ready say you <eos> volsce : a most royal one the centurions and their charges distinctly billeted already in the entertainment and to be on foot at an hour's warning <eos> roman : i am joyful to hear of their readiness and am the man i think that shall set them in present action <eos> so sir heartily well met and most glad of your company <eos> volsce : you take my part from me sir i have the most cause to be glad of yours <eos> roman : well let us go together <eos> coriolanus : a goodly city is this antium <eos> city 'tis i that made thy widows : many an heir of these fair edifices 'fore my wars have i heard groan and drop : then know me not lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones in puny battle slay me <eos> save you sir <eos> citizen : and you <eos> coriolanus : direct me if it be your will where great aufidius lies : is he in antium <eos> citizen : he is and feasts the nobles of the state at his house this night <eos> coriolanus : which is his house beseech you <eos> citizen : this here before you <eos> coriolanus : thank you sir : farewell <eos> o world thy slippery turns <eos> friends now fast sworn whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart whose house whose bed whose meal and exercise are still together who twin as 'twere in love unseparable shall within this hour on a dissension of a doit break out to bitterest enmity : so fellest foes whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep to take the one the other by some chance some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues <eos> so with me : my birth-place hate i and my love's upon this enemy town <eos> i'll enter : if he slay me he does fair justice if he give me way i'll do his country service <eos> first servingman : wine wine wine <eos> what service is here <eos> i think our fellows are asleep <eos> second servingman : where's cotus <eos> my master calls for him <eos> cotus <eos> coriolanus : a goodly house : the feast smells well but i appear not like a guest <eos> first servingman : what would you have friend <eos> whence are you <eos> here's no place for you : pray go to the door <eos> coriolanus : i have deserved no better entertainment in being coriolanus <eos> second servingman : whence are you sir <eos> has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions <eos> pray get you out <eos> coriolanus : away <eos> second servingman : away <eos> get you away <eos> coriolanus : now thou'rt troublesome <eos> second servingman : are you so brave <eos> i'll have you talked with anon <eos> third servingman : what fellow's this <eos> first servingman : a strange one as ever i looked on : i cannot get him out of the house : prithee call my master to him <eos> third servingman : what have you to do here fellow <eos> pray you avoid the house <eos> coriolanus : let me but stand i will not hurt your hearth <eos> third servingman : what are you <eos> coriolanus : a gentleman <eos> third servingman : a marvellous poor one <eos> coriolanus : true so i am <eos> third servingman : pray you poor gentleman take up some other station here's no place for you pray you avoid : come <eos> coriolanus : follow your function go and batten on cold bits <eos> third servingman : what you will not <eos> prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here <eos> second servingman : and i shall <eos> third servingman : where dwellest thou <eos> coriolanus : under the canopy <eos> third servingman : under the canopy <eos> coriolanus : ay <eos> third servingman : where's that <eos> coriolanus : i' the city of kites and crows <eos> third servingman : i' the city of kites and crows <eos> what an ass it is <eos> then thou dwellest with daws too <eos> coriolanus : no i serve not thy master <eos> third servingman : how sir <eos> do you meddle with my master <eos> coriolanus : ay 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress <eos> thou pratest and pratest serve with thy trencher hence <eos> aufidius : where is this fellow <eos> second servingman : here sir : i'ld have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords within <eos> aufidius : whence comest thou <eos> what wouldst thou <eos> thy name <eos> why speak'st not <eos> speak man : what's thy name <eos> coriolanus : if tullus not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself <eos> aufidius : what is thy name <eos> coriolanus : a name unmusical to the volscians' ears and harsh in sound to thine <eos> aufidius : say what's thy name <eos> thou hast a grim appearance and thy face bears a command in't though thy tackle's torn <eos> thou show'st a noble vessel : what's thy name <eos> coriolanus : prepare thy brow to frown : know'st thou me yet <eos> aufidius : i know thee not : thy name <eos> coriolanus : my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus : the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me : only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest and suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be whoop'd out of rome <eos> now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope <eos> mistake me not <eos>to save my life for if i had fear'd death of all the men i' the world i would have 'voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here <eos> then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn : so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my canker'd country with the spleen of all the under fiends <eos> but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes thou'rt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever follow'd thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service <eos> aufidius : o marcius marcius <eos> each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy <eos> if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say 'tis true' i'ld not believe them more than thee all noble marcius <eos> let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr'd the moon with splinters : here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour <eos> know thou first i loved the maid i married never man sigh'd truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing <eos> more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold <eos> why thou mars <eos> i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm fort : thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat and waked half dead with nothing <eos> worthy marcius had we no quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banish'd we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood o'er-bear <eos> o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself <eos> coriolanus : you bless me gods <eos> aufidius : therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take the one half of my commission and set down <eos> as best thou art experienced since thou know'st thy country's strength and weakness <eos>thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy <eos> but come in : let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires <eos> a thousand welcomes <eos> and more a friend than e'er an enemy yet marcius that was much <eos> your hand : most welcome <eos> first servingman : here's a strange alteration <eos> second servingman : by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him <eos> first servingman : what an arm he has <eos> he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top <eos> second servingman : nay i knew by his face that there was something in him : he had sir a kind of face methought <eos>i cannot tell how to term it <eos> first servingman : he had so looking as it were <eos>would i were hanged but i thought there was more in him than i could think <eos> second servingman : so did i i'll be sworn : he is simply the rarest man i' the world <eos> first servingman : i think he is : but a greater soldier than he you wot on <eos> second servingman : who my master <eos> first servingman : nay it's no matter for that <eos> second servingman : worth six on him <eos> first servingman : nay not so neither : but i take him to be the greater soldier <eos> second servingman : faith look you one cannot tell how to say that : for the defence of a town our general is excellent <eos> first servingman : ay and for an assault too <eos> third servingman : o slaves i can tell you news <eos> news you rascals <eos> first servingman : what what what <eos> let's partake <eos> third servingman : i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lieve be a condemned man <eos> first servingman : wherefore <eos> wherefore <eos> third servingman : why here's he that was wont to thwack our general caius marcius <eos> first servingman : why do you say 'thwack our general ' <eos> third servingman : i do not say 'thwack our general' but he was always good enough for him <eos> second servingman : come we are fellows and friends : he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself <eos> first servingman : he was too hard for him directly to say the troth on't : before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado <eos> second servingman : an he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too <eos> first servingman : but more of thy news <eos> third servingman : why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o' the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him : our general himself makes a mistress of him : sanctifies himself with's hand and turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse <eos> but the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i' the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table <eos> he'll go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears : he will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled <eos> second servingman : and he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine <eos> third servingman : do't <eos> he will do't for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he's in directitude <eos> first servingman : directitude <eos> what's that <eos> third servingman : but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel all with him <eos> first servingman : but when goes this forward <eos> third servingman : to-morrow to-day presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon : 'tis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips <eos> second servingman : why then we shall have a stirring world again <eos> this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad-makers <eos> first servingman : let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night it's spritely waking audible and full of vent <eos> peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men <eos> second servingman : 'tis so : and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds <eos> first servingman : ay and it makes men hate one another <eos> third servingman : reason because they then less need one another <eos> the wars for my money <eos> i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians <eos> they are rising they are rising <eos> all : in in in in <eos> sicinius : we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i' the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry <eos> here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer by't behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly <eos> brutus : we stood to't in good time <eos> is this menenius <eos> sicinius : 'tis he'tis he : o he is grown most kind of late <eos> both tribunes : hail sir <eos> menenius : hail to you both <eos> sicinius : your coriolanus is not much miss'd but with his friends : the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it <eos> menenius : all's well and might have been much better if he could have temporized <eos> sicinius : where is he hear you <eos> menenius : nay i hear nothing : his mother and his wife hear nothing from him <eos> citizens : the gods preserve you both <eos> sicinius : god-den our neighbours <eos> brutus : god-den to you all god-den to you all <eos> first citizen : ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both <eos> sicinius : live and thrive <eos> brutus : farewell kind neighbours : we wish'd coriolanus had loved you as we did <eos> citizens : now the gods keep you <eos> both tribunes : farewell farewell <eos> sicinius : this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion <eos> brutus : caius marcius was a worthy officer i' the war but insolent o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking self-loving <eos> sicinius : and affecting one sole throne without assistance <eos> menenius : i think not so <eos> sicinius : we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so <eos> brutus : the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him <eos> aedile : worthy tribunes there is a slave whom we have put in prison reports the volsces with two several powers are enter'd in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before 'em <eos> menenius : 'tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius' banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out <eos> sicinius : come what talk you of marcius <eos> brutus : go see this rumourer whipp'd <eos> it cannot be the volsces dare break with us <eos> menenius : cannot be <eos> we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like have been within my age <eos> but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded <eos> sicinius : tell not me : i know this cannot be <eos> brutus : not possible <eos> messenger : the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senate-house : some news is come that turns their countenances <eos> sicinius : 'tis this slave <eos> go whip him 'fore the people's eyes : <eos>his raising nothing but his report <eos> messenger : yes worthy sir the slave's report is seconded and more more fearful is deliver'd <eos> sicinius : what more fearful <eos> messenger : it is spoke freely out of many mouths <eos> how probable i do not know <eos>that marcius join'd with aufidius leads a power 'gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the young'st and oldest thing <eos> sicinius : this is most likely <eos> brutus : raised only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again <eos> sicinius : the very trick on't <eos> menenius : this is unlikely : he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety <eos> second messenger : you are sent for to the senate : a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already o'erborne their way consumed with fire and took what lay before them <eos> cominius : o you have made good work <eos> menenius : what news <eos> what news <eos> cominius : you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses <eos> menenius : what's the news <eos> what's the news <eos> cominius : your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confined into an auger's bore <eos> menenius : pray now your news <eos> you have made fair work i fear me <eos> <eos>pray your news <eos> <eos> if marcius should be join'd with volscians <eos> cominius : if <eos> he is their god : he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies <eos> menenius : you have made good work you and your apron-men you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic-eaters <eos> cominius : he will shake your rome about your ears <eos> menenius : as hercules did shake down mellow fruit <eos> you have made fair work <eos> brutus : but is this true sir <eos> cominius : ay and you'll look pale before you find it other <eos> all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resist are mock'd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools <eos> who is't can blame him <eos> your enemies and his find something in him <eos> menenius : we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy <eos> cominius : who shall ask it <eos> the tribunes cannot do't for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds : for his best friends if they should say 'be good to rome' they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate and therein show'd like enemies <eos> menenius : 'tis true : if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say 'beseech you cease <eos>' you have made fair hands you and your crafts <eos> you have crafted fair <eos> cominius : you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never so incapable of help <eos> both tribunes : say not we brought it <eos> menenius : how <eos> was it we <eos> we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o' the city <eos> cominius : but i fear they'll roar him in again <eos> tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer : desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them <eos> menenius : here come the clusters <eos> and is aufidius with him <eos> you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus' exile <eos> now he's coming and not a hair upon a soldier's head which will not prove a whip : as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices <eos> 'tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it <eos> citizens : faith we hear fearful news <eos> first citizen : for mine own part when i said banish him i said 'twas pity <eos> second citizen : and so did i <eos> third citizen : and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us : that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will <eos> cominius : ye re goodly things you voices <eos> menenius : you have made good work you and your cry <eos> shall's to the capitol <eos> cominius : o ay what else <eos> sicinius : go masters get you home be not dismay'd : these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear <eos> go home and show no sign of fear <eos> first citizen : the gods be good to us <eos> come masters let's home <eos> i ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished him <eos> second citizen : so did we all <eos> but come let's home <eos> brutus : i do not like this news <eos> sicinius : nor i <eos> brutus : let's to the capitol <eos> would half my wealth would buy this for a lie <eos> sicinius : pray let us go <eos> aufidius : do they still fly to the roman <eos> lieutenant : i do not know what witchcraft's in him but your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat their talk at table and their thanks at end and you are darken'd in this action sir even by your own <eos> aufidius : i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design <eos> he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him : yet his nature in that's no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended <eos> lieutenant : yet i wish sir <eos> i mean for your particular <eos>you had not join'd in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself or else to him had left it solely <eos> aufidius : i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him <eos> although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly <eos> and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragon-like and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine whene'er we come to our account <eos> lieutenant : sir i beseech you think you he'll carry rome <eos> aufidius : all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his : the senators and patricians love him too : the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence <eos> i think he'll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature <eos> first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even : whether 'twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll'd the war but one of these <eos> as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free him <eos>made him fear'd so hated and so banish'd : but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance <eos> so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time : and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done <eos> one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail <eos> come let's away <eos> when caius rome is thine thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine <eos> menenius : no i'll not go : you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular <eos> he call'd me father : but what o' that <eos> go you that banish'd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy : nay if he coy'd to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home <eos> cominius : he would not seem to know me <eos> menenius : do you hear <eos> cominius : yet one time he did call me by my name : i urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together <eos> coriolanus he would not answer to : forbad all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forged himself a name o' the fire of burning rome <eos> menenius : why so : you have made good work <eos> a pair of tribunes that have rack'd for rome to make coals cheap <eos>a noble memory <eos> cominius : i minded him how royal 'twas to pardon when it was less expected : he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punish'd <eos> menenius : very well : could he say less <eos> cominius : i offer'd to awaken his regard for's private friends : his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff : he said 'twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose the offence <eos> menenius : for one poor grain or two <eos> i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains : you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon : we must be burnt for you <eos> sicinius : nay pray be patient : if you refuse your aid in this so never-needed help yet do not upbraid's with our distress <eos> but sure if you would be your country's pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman <eos> menenius : no i'll not meddle <eos> sicinius : pray you go to him <eos> menenius : what should i do <eos> brutus : only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius <eos> menenius : well and say that marcius return me as cominius is return'd unheard what then <eos> but as a discontented friend grief-shot with his unkindness <eos> say't be so <eos> sicinius : yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well <eos> menenius : i'll undertake 't : i think he'll hear me <eos> yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me <eos> he was not taken well he had not dined : the veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priest-like fasts : therefore i'll watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i'll set upon him <eos> brutus : you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way <eos> menenius : good faith i'll prove him speed how it will <eos> i shall ere long have knowledge of my success <eos> cominius : he'll never hear him <eos> sicinius : not <eos> cominius : i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as 'twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity <eos> i kneel'd before him 'twas very faintly he said 'rise' dismiss'd me thus with his speechless hand : what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions : so that all hope is vain <eos> unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country <eos> therefore let's hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on <eos> first senator : stay : whence are you <eos> second senator : stand and go back <eos> menenius : you guard like men 'tis well : but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus <eos> first senator : from whence <eos> menenius : from rome <eos> first senator : you may not pass you must return : our general will no more hear from thence <eos> second senator : you'll see your rome embraced with fire before you'll speak with coriolanus <eos> menenius : good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius <eos> first senator : be it so go back : the virtue of your name is not here passable <eos> menenius : i tell thee fellow the general is my lover : i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his name unparallel'd haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom he's chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer : nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stamp'd the leasing : therefore fellow i must have leave to pass <eos> first senator : faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely <eos> therefore go back <eos> menenius : prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general <eos> second senator : howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have i am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass <eos> therefore go back <eos> menenius : has he dined canst thou tell <eos> for i would not speak with him till after dinner <eos> first senator : you are a roman are you <eos> menenius : i am as thy general is <eos> first senator : then you should hate rome as he does <eos> can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be <eos> can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this <eos> no you are deceived therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution : you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon <eos> menenius : sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation <eos> second senator : come my captain knows you not <eos> menenius : i mean thy general <eos> first senator : my general cares not for you <eos> back i say go lest i let forth your half-pint of blood back <eos>that's the utmost of your having : back <eos> menenius : nay but fellow fellow <eos> coriolanus : what's the matter <eos> menenius : now you companion i'll say an errand for you : you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus : guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i' the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee <eos> the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does <eos> o my son my son <eos> thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it <eos> i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen <eos> the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here <eos>this who like a block hath denied my access to thee <eos> coriolanus : away <eos> menenius : how <eos> away <eos> coriolanus : wife mother child i know not <eos> my affairs are servanted to others : though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts <eos> that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much <eos> therefore be gone <eos> mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force <eos> yet for i loved thee take this along i writ it for thy sake and would have rent it <eos> another word menenius i will not hear thee speak <eos> this man aufidius was my beloved in rome : yet thou behold'st <eos> aufidius : you keep a constant temper <eos> first senator : now sir is your name menenius <eos> second senator : 'tis a spell you see of much power : you know the way home again <eos> first senator : do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back <eos> second senator : what cause do you think i have to swoon <eos> menenius : i neither care for the world nor your general : for such things as you i can scarce think there's any ye're so slight <eos> he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another : let your general do his worst <eos> for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age <eos> i say to you as i was said to away <eos> first senator : a noble fellow i warrant him <eos> second senator : the worthy fellow is our general : he's the rock the oak not to be wind-shaken <eos> coriolanus : we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host <eos> my partner in this action you must report to the volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business <eos> aufidius : only their ends you have respected stopp'd your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper no not with such friends that thought them sure of you <eos> coriolanus : this last old man whom with a crack'd heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed <eos> their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have though i show'd sourly to him once more offer'd the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to : fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to <eos> ha <eos> what shout is this <eos> shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time 'tis made <eos> i will not <eos> my wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood <eos> but out affection <eos> all bond and privilege of nature break <eos> let it be virtuous to be obstinate <eos> what is that curt'sy worth <eos> or those doves' eyes which can make gods forsworn <eos> i melt and am not of stronger earth than others <eos> my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod : and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries 'deny not <eos>' let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy : i'll never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin <eos> virgilia : my lord and husband <eos> coriolanus : these eyes are not the same i wore in rome <eos> virgilia : the sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so <eos> coriolanus : like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace <eos> best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that 'forgive our romans <eos>' o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge <eos> now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgin'd it e'er since <eos> you gods <eos> i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted : sink my knee i' the earth of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons <eos> volumnia : o stand up blest <eos> whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent <eos> coriolanus : what is this <eos> your knees to me <eos> to your corrected son <eos> then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun murdering impossibility to make what cannot be slight work <eos> volumnia : thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee <eos> do you know this lady <eos> coriolanus : the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle that's curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian's temple : dear valeria <eos> volumnia : this is a poor epitome of yours which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself <eos> coriolanus : the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i' the wars like a great sea-mark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee <eos> volumnia : your knee sirrah <eos> coriolanus : that's my brave boy <eos> volumnia : even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you <eos> coriolanus : i beseech you peace : or if you'ld ask remember this before : the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials <eos> do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with rome's mechanics : tell me not wherein i seem unnatural : desire not to ally my rages and revenges with your colder reasons <eos> volumnia : o no more no more <eos> you have said you will not grant us any thing for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already : yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness : therefore hear us <eos> coriolanus : aufidius and you volsces mark for we'll hear nought from rome in private <eos> your request <eos> volumnia : should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile <eos> think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither : since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out <eos> and to poor we thine enmity's most capital : thou barr'st us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we alas how can we for our country pray <eos> whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound <eos> alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country <eos> we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win : for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles thorough our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood <eos> for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine : if i cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread <eos> trust to't thou shalt not <eos>on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world <eos> virgilia : ay and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time <eos> young marcius : a' shall not tread on me i'll run away till i am bigger but then i'll fight <eos> coriolanus : not of a woman's tenderness to be requires nor child nor woman's face to see <eos> i have sat too long <eos> volumnia : nay go not from us thus <eos> if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honour : no our suit is that you reconcile them : while the volsces may say 'this mercy we have show'd' the romans 'this we received' and each in either side give the all-hail to thee and cry 'be blest for making up this peace <eos>' thou know'st great son the end of war's uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses whose chronicle thus writ : 'the man was noble but with his last attempt he wiped it out destroy'd his country and his name remains to the ensuing age abhorr'd <eos>' speak to me son : thou hast affected the fine strains of honour to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak <eos> why dost not speak <eos> think'st thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs <eos> daughter speak you : he cares not for your weeping <eos> speak thou boy : perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons <eos> there's no man in the world more bound to 's mother yet here he lets me prate like one i' the stocks <eos> thou hast never in thy life show'd thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen fond of no second brood has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home loaden with honour <eos> say my request's unjust and spurn me back : but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrain'st from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs <eos> he turns away : down ladies let us shame him with our knees <eos> to his surname coriolanus 'longs more pride than pity to our prayers <eos> down : an end this is the last : so we will home to rome and die among our neighbours <eos> nay behold 's : this boy that cannot tell what he would have but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny 't <eos> come let us go : this fellow had a volscian to his mother his wife is in corioli and his child like him by chance <eos> yet give us our dispatch : i am hush'd until our city be a-fire and then i'll speak a little <eos> coriolanus : o mother mother <eos> what have you done <eos> behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at <eos> o my mother mother <eos> o <eos> you have won a happy victory to rome but for your son <eos>believe it o believe it most dangerously you have with him prevail'd if not most mortal to him <eos> but let it come <eos> aufidius though i cannot make true wars i'll frame convenient peace <eos> now good aufidius were you in my stead would you have heard a mother less <eos> or granted less aufidius <eos> aufidius : i was moved withal <eos> coriolanus : i dare be sworn you were : and sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion <eos> but good sir what peace you'll make advise me : for my part i'll not to rome i'll back with you and pray you stand to me in this cause <eos> o mother <eos> wife <eos> aufidius : coriolanus : ay by and by but we will drink together and you shall bear a better witness back than words which we on like conditions will have counter-seal'd <eos> come enter with us <eos> ladies you deserve to have a temple built you : all the swords in italy and her confederate arms could not have made this peace <eos> menenius : see you yond coign o' the capitol yond corner-stone <eos> sicinius : why what of that <eos> menenius : if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him <eos> but i say there is no hope in't : our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution <eos> sicinius : is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man <eos> menenius : there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub <eos> this marcius is grown from man to dragon : he has wings he's more than a creeping thing <eos> sicinius : he loved his mother dearly <eos> menenius : so did he me : and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse <eos> the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes : when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading : he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery <eos> he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander <eos> what he bids be done is finished with his bidding <eos> he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in <eos> sicinius : yes mercy if you report him truly <eos> menenius : i paint him in the character <eos> mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him : there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find : and all this is long of you <eos> sicinius : the gods be good unto us <eos> menenius : no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us <eos> when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us <eos> messenger : sir if you'ld save your life fly to your house : the plebeians have got your fellow-tribune and hale him up and down all swearing if the roman ladies bring not comfort home they'll give him death by inches <eos> sicinius : what's the news <eos> second messenger : good news good news the ladies have prevail'd the volscians are dislodged and marcius gone : a merrier day did never yet greet rome no not the expulsion of the tarquins <eos> sicinius : friend art thou certain this is true <eos> is it most certain <eos> second messenger : as certain as i know the sun is fire : where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it <eos> ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide as the recomforted through the gates <eos> why hark you <eos> the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans make the sun dance <eos> hark you <eos> menenius : this is good news : i will go meet the ladies <eos> this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full <eos> you have pray'd well to-day : this morning for ten thousand of your throats i'd not have given a doit <eos> hark how they joy <eos> sicinius : first the gods bless you for your tidings next accept my thankfulness <eos> second messenger : sir we have all great cause to give great thanks <eos> sicinius : they are near the city <eos> second messenger : almost at point to enter <eos> sicinius : we will meet them and help the joy <eos> first senator : behold our patroness the life of rome <eos> call all your tribes together praise the gods and make triumphant fires strew flowers before them : unshout the noise that banish'd marcius repeal him with the welcome of his mother cry 'welcome ladies welcome <eos>' all : welcome ladies welcome <eos> aufidius : go tell the lords o' the city i am here : deliver them this paper : having read it bid them repair to the market place where i even in theirs and in the commons' ears will vouch the truth of it <eos> him i accuse the city ports by this hath enter'd and intends to appear before the people hoping to purge herself with words : dispatch <eos> most welcome <eos> first conspirator : how is it with our general <eos> aufidius : even so as with a man by his own alms empoison'd and with his charity slain <eos> second conspirator : most noble sir if you do hold the same intent wherein you wish'd us parties we'll deliver you of your great danger <eos> aufidius : sir i cannot tell : we must proceed as we do find the people <eos> third conspirator : the people will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all <eos> aufidius : i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction <eos> i raised him and i pawn'd mine honour for his truth : who being so heighten'd he water'd his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bow'd his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free <eos> third conspirator : sir his stoutness when he did stand for consul which he lost by lack of stooping <eos> aufidius : that i would have spoke of : being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat : i took him made him joint-servant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong : till at the last i seem'd his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary <eos> first conspirator : so he did my lord : the army marvell'd at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we look'd for no less spoil than glory <eos> aufidius : there was it : for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him <eos> at a few drops of women's rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action : therefore shall he die and i'll renew me in his fall <eos> but hark <eos> first conspirator : your native town you enter'd like a post and had no welcomes home : but he returns splitting the air with noise <eos> second conspirator : and patient fools whose children he hath slain their base throats tear with giving him glory <eos> third conspirator : therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let him feel your sword which we will second <eos> when he lies along after your way his tale pronounced shall bury his reasons with his body <eos> aufidius : say no more : here come the lords <eos> all the lords : you are most welcome home <eos> aufidius : i have not deserved it <eos> but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you <eos> lords : we have <eos> first lord : and grieve to hear't <eos> what faults he made before the last i think might have found easy fines : but there to end where he was to begin and give away the benefit of our levies answering us with our own charge making a treaty where there was a yielding <eos>this admits no excuse <eos> aufidius : he approaches : you shall hear him <eos> coriolanus : hail lords <eos> i am return'd your soldier no more infected with my country's love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command <eos> you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome <eos> our spoils we have brought home do more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action <eos> we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to the romans : and we here deliver subscribed by the consuls and patricians together with the seal o' the senate what we have compounded on <eos> aufidius : read it not noble lords but tell the traitor in the high'st degree he hath abused your powers <eos> coriolanus : traitor <eos> how now <eos> aufidius : ay traitor marcius <eos> coriolanus : marcius <eos> aufidius : ay marcius caius marcius : dost thou think i'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name coriolanus in corioli <eos> you lords and heads o' the state perfidiously he has betray'd your business and given up for certain drops of salt your city rome i say 'your city' to his wife and mother breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk never admitting counsel o' the war but at his nurse's tears he whined and roar'd away your victory that pages blush'd at him and men of heart look'd wondering each at other <eos> coriolanus : hear'st thou mars <eos> aufidius : name not the god thou boy of tears <eos> coriolanus : ha <eos> aufidius : no more <eos> coriolanus : measureless liar thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it <eos> boy <eos> o slave <eos> pardon me lords 'tis the first time that ever i was forced to scold <eos> your judgments my grave lords must give this cur the lie : and his own notion <eos> who wears my stripes impress'd upon him that must bear my beating to his grave <eos>shall join to thrust the lie unto him <eos> first lord : peace both and hear me speak <eos> coriolanus : cut me to pieces volsces men and lads stain all your edges on me <eos> boy <eos> false hound <eos> if you have writ your annals true 'tis there that like an eagle in a dove-cote i flutter'd your volscians in corioli : alone i did it <eos> boy <eos> aufidius : why noble lords will you be put in mind of his blind fortune which was your shame by this unholy braggart 'fore your own eyes and ears <eos> all conspirators : let him die for't <eos> all the people : 'tear him to pieces <eos>' 'do it presently <eos>' 'he kill'd my son <eos>' 'my daughter <eos>' 'he killed my cousin marcus <eos>' 'he killed my father <eos>' second lord : peace ho <eos> no outrage : peace <eos> the man is noble and his fame folds-in this orb o' the earth <eos> his last offences to us shall have judicious hearing <eos> stand aufidius and trouble not the peace <eos> coriolanus : o that i had him with six aufidiuses or more his tribe to use my lawful sword <eos> aufidius : insolent villain <eos> all conspirators : kill kill kill kill kill him <eos> lords : hold hold hold hold <eos> aufidius : my noble masters hear me speak <eos> first lord : o tullus <eos> second lord : thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep <eos> third lord : tread not upon him <eos> masters all be quiet put up your swords <eos> aufidius : my lords when you shall know <eos>as in this rage provoked by him you cannot <eos>the great danger which this man's life did owe you you'll rejoice that he is thus cut off <eos> please it your honours to call me to your senate i'll deliver myself your loyal servant or endure your heaviest censure <eos> first lord : bear from hence his body and mourn you for him : let him be regarded as the most noble corse that ever herald did follow to his urn <eos> second lord : his own impatience takes from aufidius a great part of blame <eos> let's make the best of it <eos> aufidius : my rage is gone and i am struck with sorrow <eos> take him up <eos> help three o' the chiefest soldiers i'll be one <eos> beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully : trail your steel pikes <eos> though in this city he hath widow'd and unchilded many a one which to this hour bewail the injury yet he shall have a noble memory <eos> assist <eos> gloucester : now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried <eos> now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures <eos> grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute <eos> but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking-glass i that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtail'd of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinish'd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity : and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well-spoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days <eos> plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other : and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mew'd up about a prophecy which says that 'g' of edward's heirs the murderer shall be <eos> dive thoughts down to my soul : here clarence comes <eos> brother good day what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace <eos> clarence : his majesty tendering my person's safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower <eos> gloucester : upon what cause <eos> clarence : because my name is george <eos> gloucester : alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers : o belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be new-christen'd in the tower <eos> but what's the matter clarence <eos> may i know <eos> clarence : yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not : but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the cross-row plucks the letter g <eos> and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he <eos> these as i learn and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now <eos> gloucester : why this it is when men are ruled by women : 'tis not the king that sends you to the tower : my lady grey his wife clarence 'tis she that tempers him to this extremity <eos> was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliver'd <eos> we are not safe clarence we are not safe <eos> clarence : by heaven i think there's no man is secure but the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore <eos> heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery <eos> gloucester : humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty <eos> i'll tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery : the jealous o'erworn widow and herself since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen <eos> are mighty gossips in this monarchy <eos> brakenbury : i beseech your graces both to pardon me his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference of what degree soever with his brother <eos> gloucester : even so an't please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say : we speak no treason man : we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks : how say you sir <eos> can you deny all this <eos> brakenbury : with this my lord myself have nought to do <eos> gloucester : naught to do with mistress shore <eos> i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best he do it secretly alone <eos> brakenbury : what one my lord <eos> gloucester : her husband knave : wouldst thou betray me <eos> brakenbury : i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke <eos> clarence : we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey <eos> gloucester : we are the queen's abjects and must obey <eos> brother farewell : i will unto the king and whatsoever you will employ me in were it to call king edward's widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you <eos> meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine <eos> clarence : i know it pleaseth neither of us well <eos> gloucester : well your imprisonment shall not be long meantime have patience <eos> clarence : i must perforce <eos> farewell <eos> gloucester : go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return <eos> simple plain clarence <eos> i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands <eos> but who comes here <eos> the new-deliver'd hastings <eos> hastings : good time of day unto my gracious lord <eos> gloucester : as much unto my good lord chamberlain <eos> well are you welcome to the open air <eos> how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment <eos> hastings : with patience noble lord as prisoners must : but i shall live my lord to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment <eos> gloucester : no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevail'd as much on him as you <eos> hastings : more pity that the eagle should be mew'd while kites and buzzards prey at liberty <eos> gloucester : what news abroad <eos> hastings : no news so bad abroad as this at home the king is sickly weak and melancholy and his physicians fear him mightily <eos> gloucester : now by saint paul this news is bad indeed <eos> o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person : 'tis very grievous to be thought upon <eos> what is he in his bed <eos> hastings : he is <eos> gloucester : go you before and i will follow you <eos> he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven <eos> i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments and if i fall not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live : which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in <eos> for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter <eos> what though i kill'd her husband and her father <eos> the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father : the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto <eos> but yet i run before my horse to market : clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns : when they are gone then must i count my gains <eos> lady anne : set down set down your honourable load if honour may be shrouded in a hearse whilst i awhile obsequiously lament the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster <eos> poor key-cold figure of a holy king <eos> pale ashes of the house of lancaster <eos> thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood <eos> be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost to hear the lamentations of poor anne wife to thy edward to thy slaughter'd son stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds <eos> lo in these windows that let forth thy life i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes <eos> cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes <eos> cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it <eos> cursed the blood that let this blood from hence <eos> more direful hap betide that hated wretch that makes us wretched by the death of thee than i can wish to adders spiders toads or any creeping venom'd thing that lives <eos> if ever he have child abortive be it prodigious and untimely brought to light whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view and that be heir to his unhappiness <eos> if ever he have wife let her he made a miserable by the death of him as i am made by my poor lord and thee <eos> come now towards chertsey with your holy load taken from paul's to be interred there and still as you are weary of the weight rest you whiles i lament king henry's corse <eos> gloucester : stay you that bear the corse and set it down <eos> lady anne : what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds <eos> gloucester : villains set down the corse or by saint paul i'll make a corse of him that disobeys <eos> gentleman : my lord stand back and let the coffin pass <eos> gloucester : unmanner'd dog <eos> stand thou when i command : advance thy halbert higher than my breast or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness <eos> lady anne : what do you tremble <eos> are you all afraid <eos> alas i blame you not for you are mortal and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil <eos> avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell <eos> thou hadst but power over his mortal body his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone <eos> gloucester : sweet saint for charity be not so curst <eos> lady anne : foul devil for god's sake hence and trouble us not for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims <eos> if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds behold this pattern of thy butcheries <eos> o gentlemen see see <eos> dead henry's wounds open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh <eos> blush blush thou lump of foul deformity for 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells thy deed inhuman and unnatural provokes this deluge most unnatural <eos> o god which this blood madest revenge his death <eos> o earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death <eos> either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead or earth gape open wide and eat him quick as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered <eos> gloucester : lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses <eos> lady anne : villain thou know'st no law of god nor man : no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity <eos> gloucester : but i know none and therefore am no beast <eos> lady anne : o wonderful when devils tell the truth <eos> gloucester : more wonderful when angels are so angry <eos> vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposed-evils to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself <eos> lady anne : vouchsafe defused infection of a man for these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursed self <eos> gloucester : fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself <eos> lady anne : fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself <eos> gloucester : by such despair i should accuse myself <eos> lady anne : and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself which didst unworthy slaughter upon others <eos> gloucester : say that i slew them not <eos> lady anne : why then they are not dead : but dead they are and devilish slave by thee <eos> gloucester : i did not kill your husband <eos> lady anne : why then he is alive <eos> gloucester : nay he is dead and slain by edward's hand <eos> lady anne : in thy foul throat thou liest : queen margaret saw thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood the which thou once didst bend against her breast but that thy brothers beat aside the point <eos> gloucester : i was provoked by her slanderous tongue which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders <eos> lady anne : thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind <eos> which never dreamt on aught but butcheries : didst thou not kill this king <eos> gloucester : i grant ye <eos> lady anne : dost grant me hedgehog <eos> then god grant me too thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed <eos> o he was gentle mild and virtuous <eos> gloucester : the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him <eos> lady anne : he is in heaven where thou shalt never come <eos> gloucester : let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth <eos> lady anne : and thou unfit for any place but hell <eos> gloucester : yes one place else if you will hear me name it <eos> lady anne : some dungeon <eos> gloucester : your bed-chamber <eos> lady anne : i'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest <eos> gloucester : so will it madam till i lie with you <eos> lady anne : i hope so <eos> gloucester : i know so <eos> but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner <eos> lady anne : thou art the cause and most accursed effect <eos> gloucester : your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty : which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom <eos> lady anne : if i thought that i tell thee homicide these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks <eos> gloucester : these eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by : as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life <eos> lady anne : black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life <eos> gloucester : curse not thyself fair creature thou art both <eos> lady anne : i would i were to be revenged on thee <eos> gloucester : it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth you <eos> lady anne : it is a quarrel just and reasonable to be revenged on him that slew my husband <eos> gloucester : he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband <eos> lady anne : his better doth not breathe upon the earth <eos> gloucester : he lives that loves thee better than he could <eos> lady anne : name him <eos> gloucester : plantagenet <eos> lady anne : why that was he <eos> gloucester : the selfsame name but one of better nature <eos> lady anne : where is he <eos> gloucester : here <eos> why dost thou spit at me <eos> lady anne : would it were mortal poison for thy sake <eos> gloucester : never came poison from so sweet a place <eos> lady anne : never hung poison on a fouler toad <eos> out of my sight <eos> thou dost infect my eyes <eos> gloucester : thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine <eos> lady anne : would they were basilisks to strike thee dead <eos> gloucester : i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death <eos> those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspect with store of childish drops : these eyes that never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when black-faced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my father's death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standers-by had wet their cheeks like trees bedash'd with rain : in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping <eos> i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak <eos> teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt <eos> if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharp-pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom <eos> and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee <eos> nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but 'twas thy beauty that provoked me <eos> nay now dispatch 'twas i that stabb'd young edward but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on <eos> take up the sword again or take up me <eos> lady anne : arise dissembler : though i wish thy death i will not be the executioner <eos> gloucester : then bid me kill myself and i will do it <eos> lady anne : i have already <eos> gloucester : tush that was in thy rage : speak it again and even with the word that hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary <eos> lady anne : i would i knew thy heart <eos> gloucester : 'tis figured in my tongue <eos> lady anne : i fear me both are false <eos> gloucester : then never man was true <eos> lady anne : well well put up your sword <eos> gloucester : say then my peace is made <eos> lady anne : that shall you know hereafter <eos> gloucester : but shall i live in hope <eos> lady anne : all men i hope live so <eos> gloucester : vouchsafe to wear this ring <eos> lady anne : to take is not to give <eos> gloucester : look how this ring encompasseth finger <eos> even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine <eos> and if thy poor devoted suppliant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever <eos> lady anne : what is it <eos> gloucester : that it would please thee leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby place where after i have solemnly interr'd at chertsey monastery this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you : for divers unknown reasons <eos> i beseech you grant me this boon <eos> lady anne : with all my heart and much it joys me too to see you are become so penitent <eos> tressel and berkeley go along with me <eos> gloucester : bid me farewell <eos> lady anne : 'tis more than you deserve but since you teach me how to flatter you imagine i have said farewell already <eos> gloucester : sirs take up the corse <eos> gentlemen : towards chertsey noble lord <eos> gloucester : no to white-friars there attend my coining <eos> was ever woman in this humour woo'd <eos> was ever woman in this humour won <eos> i'll have her but i will not keep her long <eos> what <eos> i that kill'd her husband and his father to take her in her heart's extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of her hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i nothing to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing <eos> ha <eos> hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury <eos> a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet debase her eyes on me that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woful bed <eos> on me whose all not equals edward's moiety <eos> on me that halt and am unshapen thus <eos> my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while : upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marvellous proper man <eos> i'll be at charges for a looking-glass and entertain some score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body : since i am crept in favour with myself will maintain it with some little cost <eos> but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love <eos> shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass <eos> rivers : have patience madam : there's no doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustom'd health <eos> grey : in that you brook it in it makes him worse : therefore for god's sake entertain good comfort and cheer his grace with quick and merry words <eos> queen elizabeth : if he were dead what would betide of me <eos> rivers : no other harm but loss of such a lord <eos> queen elizabeth : the loss of such a lord includes all harm <eos> grey : the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son to be your comforter when he is gone <eos> queen elizabeth : oh he is young and his minority is put unto the trust of richard gloucester a man that loves not me nor none of you <eos> rivers : is it concluded that he shall be protector <eos> queen elizabeth : it is determined not concluded yet : but so it must be if the king miscarry <eos> grey : here come the lords of buckingham and derby <eos> buckingham : good time of day unto your royal grace <eos> derby : god make your majesty joyful as you have been <eos> queen elizabeth : the countess richmond good my lord of derby <eos> to your good prayers will scarcely say amen <eos> yet derby notwithstanding she's your wife and loves not me be you good lord assured i hate not you for her proud arrogance <eos> derby : i do beseech you either not believe the envious slanders of her false accusers or if she be accused in true report bear with her weakness which i think proceeds from wayward sickness and no grounded malice <eos> rivers : saw you the king to-day my lord of derby <eos> derby : but now the duke of buckingham and i are come from visiting his majesty <eos> queen elizabeth : what likelihood of his amendment lords <eos> buckingham : madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully <eos> queen elizabeth : god grant him health <eos> did you confer with him <eos> buckingham : madam we did : he desires to make atonement betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain and sent to warn them to his royal presence <eos> queen elizabeth : would all were well <eos> but that will never be i fear our happiness is at the highest <eos> gloucester : they do me wrong and i will not endure it : who are they that complain unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not <eos> by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours <eos> because i cannot flatter and speak fair smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy <eos> cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused by silken sly insinuating jacks <eos> rivers : to whom in all this presence speaks your grace <eos> gloucester : to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace <eos> when have i injured thee <eos> when done thee wrong <eos> or thee <eos> or thee <eos> or any of your faction <eos> a plague upon you all <eos> his royal person <eos> whom god preserve better than you would wish <eos> <eos> cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints <eos> queen elizabeth : brother of gloucester you mistake the matter <eos> the king of his own royal disposition and not provoked by any suitor else aiming belike at your interior hatred which in your outward actions shows itself against my kindred brothers and myself makes him to send that thereby he may gather the ground of your ill-will and so remove it <eos> gloucester : i cannot tell : the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch : since every jack became a gentleman there's many a gentle person made a jack <eos> queen elizabeth : come come we know your meaning brother gloucester you envy my advancement and my friends' : god grant we never may have need of you <eos> gloucester : meantime god grants that we have need of you : your brother is imprison'd by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt whilst many fair promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble <eos> queen elizabeth : by him that raised me to this careful height from that contented hap which i enjoy'd i never did incense his majesty against the duke of clarence but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him <eos> my lord you do me shameful injury falsely to draw me in these vile suspects <eos> gloucester : you may deny that you were not the cause of my lord hastings' late imprisonment <eos> rivers : she may my lord for <eos> gloucester : she may lord rivers <eos> why who knows not so <eos> she may do more sir than denying that : she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honours on your high deserts <eos> what may she not <eos> she may yea marry may she <eos> rivers : what marry may she <eos> gloucester : what marry may she <eos> marry with a king a bachelor a handsome stripling too : i wis your grandam had a worser match <eos> queen elizabeth : my lord of gloucester i have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs : by heaven i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts i often have endured <eos> i had rather be a country servant-maid than a great queen with this condition to be thus taunted scorn'd and baited at : small joy have i in being england's queen <eos> queen margaret : and lessen'd be that small god i beseech thee <eos> thy honour state and seat is due to me <eos> gloucester : what <eos> threat you me with telling of the king <eos> tell him and spare not : look what i have said i will avouch in presence of the king : i dare adventure to be sent to the tower <eos> 'tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot <eos> queen margaret : out devil <eos> i remember them too well : thou slewest my husband henry in the tower and edward my poor son at tewksbury <eos> gloucester : ere you were queen yea or your husband king i was a pack-horse in his great affairs a weeder-out of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends : to royalize his blood i spilt mine own <eos> queen margaret : yea and much better blood than his or thine <eos> gloucester : in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster and rivers so were you <eos> was not your husband in margaret's battle at saint alban's slain <eos> let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere now and what you are withal what i have been and what i am <eos> queen margaret : a murderous villain and so still thou art <eos> gloucester : poor clarence did forsake his father warwick yea and forswore himself <eos>which jesu pardon <eos> <eos> queen margaret : which god revenge <eos> gloucester : to fight on edward's party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mew'd up <eos> i would to god my heart were flint like edward's or edward's soft and pitiful like mine i am too childish-foolish for this world <eos> queen margaret : hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world thou cacodemon <eos> there thy kingdom is <eos> rivers : my lord of gloucester in those busy days which here you urge to prove us enemies we follow'd then our lord our lawful king : so should we you if you should be our king <eos> gloucester : if i should be <eos> i had rather be a pedlar : far be it from my heart the thought of it <eos> queen elizabeth : as little joy my lord as you suppose you should enjoy were you this country's king as little joy may you suppose in me <eos> that i enjoy being the queen thereof <eos> queen margaret : a little joy enjoys the queen thereof for i am she and altogether joyless <eos> i can no longer hold me patient <eos> hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out in sharing that which you have pill'd from me <eos> which of you trembles not that looks on me <eos> if not that i being queen you bow like subjects yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels <eos> o gentle villain do not turn away <eos> gloucester : foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight <eos> queen margaret : but repetition of what thou hast marr'd that will i make before i let thee go <eos> gloucester : wert thou not banished on pain of death <eos> queen margaret : i was but i do find more pain in banishment than death can yield me here by my abode <eos> a husband and a son thou owest to me and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance : the sorrow that i have by right is yours and all the pleasures you usurp are mine <eos> gloucester : the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland <eos> his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed <eos> queen elizabeth : so just is god to right the innocent <eos> hastings : o 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe and the most merciless that e'er was heard of <eos> rivers : tyrants themselves wept when it was reported <eos> dorset : no man but prophesied revenge for it <eos> buckingham : northumberland then present wept to see it <eos> queen margaret : what were you snarling all before i came ready to catch each other by the throat and turn you all your hatred now on me <eos> did york's dread curse prevail so much with heaven <eos> that henry's death my lovely edward's death their kingdom's loss my woful banishment could all but answer for that peevish brat <eos> can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven <eos> why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses <eos> if not by war by surfeit die your king as ours by murder to make him a king <eos> edward thy son which now is prince of wales for edward my son which was prince of wales die in his youth by like untimely violence <eos> thyself a queen for me that was a queen outlive thy glory like my wretched self <eos> long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss and see another as i see thee now deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine <eos> long die thy happy days before thy death and after many lengthen'd hours of grief die neither mother wife nor england's queen <eos> rivers and dorset you were standers by and so wast thou lord hastings when my son was stabb'd with bloody daggers : god i pray him that none of you may live your natural age but by some unlook'd accident cut off <eos> gloucester : have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag <eos> queen margaret : and leave out thee <eos> stay dog for thou shalt hear me <eos> if heaven have any grievous plague in store exceeding those that i can wish upon thee o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe and then hurl down their indignation on thee the troubler of the poor world's peace <eos> the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul <eos> thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends <eos> no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine unless it be whilst some tormenting dream affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils <eos> thou elvish-mark'd abortive rooting hog <eos> thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity the slave of nature and the son of hell <eos> thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb <eos> thou loathed issue of thy father's loins <eos> thou rag of honour <eos> thou detested <eos> gloucester : margaret <eos> queen margaret : richard <eos> gloucester : ha <eos> queen margaret : i call thee not <eos> gloucester : i cry thee mercy then for i had thought that thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names <eos> queen margaret : why so i did but look'd for no reply <eos> o let me make the period to my curse <eos> gloucester : 'tis done by me and ends in 'margaret <eos>' queen elizabeth : thus have you breathed your curse against yourself <eos> queen margaret : poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune <eos> why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider whose deadly web ensnareth thee about <eos> fool fool <eos> thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself <eos> the time will come when thou shalt wish for me to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad <eos> hastings : false-boding woman end thy frantic curse lest to thy harm thou move our patience <eos> queen margaret : foul shame upon you <eos> you have all moved mine <eos> rivers : were you well served you would be taught your duty <eos> queen margaret : to serve me well you all should do me duty teach me to be your queen and you my subjects : o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty <eos> dorset : dispute not with her she is lunatic <eos> queen margaret : peace master marquess you are malapert : your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current <eos> o that your young nobility could judge what 'twere to lose it and be miserable <eos> they that stand high have many blasts to shake them and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces <eos> gloucester : good counsel marry : learn it learn it marquess <eos> dorset : it toucheth you my lord as much as me <eos> gloucester : yea and much more : but i was born so high our aery buildeth in the cedar's top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun <eos> queen margaret : and turns the sun to shade alas <eos> alas <eos> witness my son now in the shade of death whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath hath in eternal darkness folded up <eos> your aery buildeth in our aery's nest <eos> o god that seest it do not suffer it <eos> as it was won with blood lost be it so <eos> buckingham : have done <eos> for shame if not for charity <eos> queen margaret : urge neither charity nor shame to me : uncharitably with me have you dealt and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd <eos> my charity is outrage life my shame and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage <eos> buckingham : have done have done <eos> queen margaret : o princely buckingham i'll kiss thy hand in sign of league and amity with thee : now fair befal thee and thy noble house <eos> thy garments are not spotted with our blood nor thou within the compass of my curse <eos> buckingham : nor no one here for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air <eos> queen margaret : i'll not believe but they ascend the sky and there awake god's gentle-sleeping peace <eos> o buckingham take heed of yonder dog <eos> look when he fawns he bites and when he bites his venom tooth will rankle to the death : have not to do with him beware of him sin death and hell have set their marks on him and all their ministers attend on him <eos> gloucester : what doth she say my lord of buckingham <eos> buckingham : nothing that i respect my gracious lord <eos> queen margaret : what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel <eos> and soothe the devil that i warn thee from <eos> o but remember this another day when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow and say poor margaret was a prophetess <eos> live each of you the subjects to his hate and he to yours and all of you to god's <eos> hastings : my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses <eos> rivers : and so doth mine : i muse why she's at liberty <eos> gloucester : i cannot blame her : by god's holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her <eos> queen elizabeth : i never did her any to my knowledge <eos> gloucester : but you have all the vantage of her wrong <eos> i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now <eos> marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause of it <eos> rivers : a virtuous and a christian-like conclusion to pray for them that have done scathe to us <eos> gloucester : so do i ever : being well-advised <eos> for had i cursed now i had cursed myself <eos> catesby : madam his majesty doth call for you and for your grace and you my noble lords <eos> queen elizabeth : catesby we come <eos> lords will you go with us <eos> rivers : madam we will attend your grace <eos> gloucester : i do the wrong and first begin to brawl <eos> the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others <eos> clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to hastings derby buckingham and say it is the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother <eos> now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey : but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil : and thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil <eos> but soft <eos> here come my executioners <eos> how now my hardy stout resolved mates <eos> are you now going to dispatch this deed <eos> first murderer : we are my lord and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is <eos> gloucester : well thought upon i have it here about me <eos> when you have done repair to crosby place <eos> but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is well-spoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him <eos> first murderer : tush <eos> fear not my lord we will not stand to prate talkers are no good doers : be assured we come to use our hands and not our tongues <eos> gloucester : your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes drop tears : i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch <eos> first murderer : we will my noble lord <eos> brakenbury : why looks your grace so heavily today <eos> clarence : o i have pass'd a miserable night so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though 'twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time <eos> brakenbury : what was your dream <eos> i long to hear you tell it <eos> clarence : methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embark'd to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches : thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall'n us <eos> as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main <eos> lord lord <eos> methought what pain it was to drown <eos> what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears <eos> what ugly sights of death within mine eyes <eos> methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea : some lay in dead men's skulls and in those holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by <eos> brakenbury : had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep <eos> clarence : methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost : but still the envious flood kept in my soul and would not let it forth to seek the empty vast and wandering air but smother'd it within my panting bulk which almost burst to belch it in the sea <eos> brakenbury : awaked you not with this sore agony <eos> clarence : o no my dream was lengthen'd after life o then began the tempest to my soul who pass'd methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night <eos> the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great father-in-law renowned warwick who cried aloud 'what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence <eos>' and so he vanish'd : then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he squeak'd out aloud 'clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments <eos>' with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environ'd me about and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling waked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made the dream <eos> brakenbury : no marvel my lord though it affrighted you i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it <eos> clarence : o brakenbury i have done those things which now bear evidence against my soul for edward's sake and see how he requites me <eos> o god <eos> if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children <eos> i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep <eos> brakenbury : i will my lord : god give your grace good rest <eos> sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noon-tide night <eos> princes have but their tides for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imagination they often feel a world of restless cares : so that betwixt their tides and low names there's nothing differs but the outward fame <eos> first murderer : ho <eos> who's here <eos> brakenbury : in god's name what are you and how came you hither <eos> first murderer : i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs <eos> brakenbury : yea are you so brief <eos> second murderer : o sir it is better to be brief than tedious <eos> show him our commission talk no more <eos> brakenbury : i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands : i will not reason what is meant hereby because i will be guiltless of the meaning <eos> here are the keys there sits the duke asleep : i'll to the king and signify to him that thus i have resign'd my charge to you <eos> first murderer : do so it is a point of wisdom : fare you well <eos> second murderer : what shall we stab him as he sleeps <eos> first murderer : no then he will say 'twas done cowardly when he wakes <eos> second murderer : when he wakes <eos> why fool he shall never wake till the judgment-day <eos> first murderer : why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping <eos> second murderer : the urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind of remorse in me <eos> first murderer : what art thou afraid <eos> second murderer : not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us <eos> first murderer : i thought thou hadst been resolute <eos> second murderer : so i am to let him live <eos> first murderer : back to the duke of gloucester tell him so <eos> second murderer : i pray thee stay a while : i hope my holy humour will change 'twas wont to hold me but while one would tell twenty <eos> first murderer : how dost thou feel thyself now <eos> second murderer : 'faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me <eos> first murderer : remember our reward when the deed is done <eos> second murderer : 'zounds he dies : i had forgot the reward <eos> first murderer : where is thy conscience now <eos> second murderer : in the duke of gloucester's purse <eos> first murderer : so when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out <eos> second murderer : let it go there's few or none will entertain it <eos> first murderer : how if it come to thee again <eos> second murderer : i'll not meddle with it : it is a dangerous thing : it makes a man a coward : a man cannot steal but it accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it detects him : 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom it fills one full of obstacles : it made me once restore a purse of gold that i found it beggars any man that keeps it : it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it <eos> first murderer : 'zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke <eos> second murderer : take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not : he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh <eos> first murderer : tut i am strong-framed he cannot prevail with me i warrant thee <eos> second murderer : spoke like a tail fellow that respects his reputation <eos> come shall we to this gear <eos> first murderer : take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt in the next room <eos> second murderer : o excellent devise <eos> make a sop of him <eos> first murderer : hark <eos> he stirs : shall i strike <eos> second murderer : no first let's reason with him <eos> clarence : where art thou keeper <eos> give me a cup of wine <eos> second murderer : you shall have wine enough my lord anon <eos> clarence : in god's name what art thou <eos> second murderer : a man as you are <eos> clarence : but not as i am royal <eos> second murderer : nor you as we are loyal <eos> clarence : thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble <eos> second murderer : my voice is now the king's my looks mine own <eos> clarence : how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak <eos> your eyes do menace me : why look you pale <eos> who sent you hither <eos> wherefore do you come <eos> both : to to to <eos> clarence : to murder me <eos> both : ay ay <eos> clarence : you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it <eos> wherein my friends have i offended you <eos> first murderer : offended us you have not but the king <eos> clarence : i shall be reconciled to him again <eos> second murderer : never my lord therefore prepare to die <eos> clarence : are you call'd forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent <eos> what is my offence <eos> where are the evidence that do accuse me <eos> what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge <eos> or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence' death <eos> before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful <eos> i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable <eos> first murderer : what we will do we do upon command <eos> second murderer : and he that hath commanded is the king <eos> clarence : erroneous vassal <eos> the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder : and wilt thou then spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's <eos> take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands to hurl upon their heads that break his law <eos> second murderer : and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too : thou didst receive the holy sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster <eos> first murderer : and like a traitor to the name of god didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son <eos> second murderer : whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend <eos> first murderer : how canst thou urge god's dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in so dear degree <eos> clarence : alas <eos> for whose sake did i that ill deed <eos> for edward for my brother for his sake : why sirs he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i <eos> if god will be revenged for this deed <eos> o know you yet he doth it publicly take not the quarrel from his powerful arm he needs no indirect nor lawless course to cut off those that have offended him <eos> first murderer : who made thee then a bloody minister when gallant-springing brave plantagenet that princely novice was struck dead by thee <eos> clarence : my brother's love the devil and my rage <eos> first murderer : thy brother's love our duty and thy fault provoke us hither now to slaughter thee <eos> clarence : oh if you love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well <eos> if you be hired for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death <eos> second murderer : you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you <eos> clarence : o no he loves me and he holds me dear : go you to him from me <eos> both : ay so we will <eos> clarence : tell him when that our princely father york bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm and charged us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship : bid gloucester think of this and he will weep <eos> first murderer : ay millstones as be lesson'd us to weep <eos> clarence : o do not slander him for he is kind <eos> first murderer : right as snow in harvest <eos> thou deceivest thyself : 'tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee <eos> clarence : it cannot be for when i parted with him he hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labour my delivery <eos> second murderer : why so he doth now he delivers thee from this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven <eos> first murderer : make peace with god for you must die my lord <eos> clarence : hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul to counsel me to make my peace with god and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind that thou wilt war with god by murdering me <eos> ah sirs consider he that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed <eos> second murderer : what shall we do <eos> clarence : relent and save your souls <eos> first murderer : relent <eos> 'tis cowardly and womanish <eos> clarence : not to relent is beastly savage devilish <eos> which of you if you were a prince's son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life <eos> my friend i spy some pity in thy looks : o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities not <eos> second murderer : look behind you my lord <eos> first murderer : take that and that : if all this will not do i'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within <eos> second murderer : a bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd <eos> how fain like pilate would i wash my hands of this most grievous guilty murder done <eos> first murderer : how now <eos> what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not <eos> by heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art <eos> second murderer : i would he knew that i had saved his brother <eos> take thou the fee and tell him what i say for i repent me that the duke is slain <eos> first murderer : so do not i : go coward as thou art <eos> now must i hide his body in some hole until the duke take order for his burial : and when i have my meed i must away for this will out and here i must not stay <eos> king edward iv : why so : now have i done a good day's work : you peers continue this united league : i every day expect an embassage from my redeemer to redeem me hence and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven since i have set my friends at peace on earth <eos> rivers and hastings take each other's hand dissemble not your hatred swear your love <eos> rivers : by heaven my heart is purged from grudging hate : and with my hand i seal my true heart's love <eos> hastings : so thrive i as i truly swear the like <eos> king edward iv : take heed you dally not before your king lest he that is the supreme king of kings confound your hidden falsehood and award either of you to be the other's end <eos> hastings : so prosper i as i swear perfect love <eos> rivers : and i as i love hastings with my heart <eos> king edward iv : madam yourself are not exempt in this nor your son dorset buckingham nor you you have been factious one against the other wife love lord hastings let him kiss your hand and what you do do it unfeignedly <eos> queen elizabeth : here hastings i will never more remember our former hatred so thrive i and mine <eos> king edward iv : dorset embrace him hastings love lord marquess <eos> dorset : this interchange of love i here protest upon my part shall be unviolable <eos> hastings : and so swear i my lord king edward iv : now princely buckingham seal thou this league with thy embracements to my wife's allies and make me happy in your unity <eos> buckingham : whenever buckingham doth turn his hate on you or yours but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours god punish me with hate in those where i expect most love <eos> when i have most need to employ a friend and most assured that he is a friend deep hollow treacherous and full of guile be he unto me <eos> this do i beg of god when i am cold in zeal to yours <eos> king edward iv : a pleasing cordial princely buckingham is this thy vow unto my sickly heart <eos> there wanteth now our brother gloucester here to make the perfect period of this peace <eos> buckingham : and in good time here comes the noble duke <eos> gloucester : good morrow to my sovereign king and queen : and princely peers a happy time of day <eos> king edward iv : happy indeed as we have spent the day <eos> brother we done deeds of charity made peace enmity fair love of hate between these swelling wrong-incensed peers <eos> gloucester : a blessed labour my most sovereign liege : amongst this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace : 'tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good men's love <eos> first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodged between us of you lord rivers and lord grey of you that without desert have frown'd on me dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all <eos> i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born to-night i thank my god for my humility <eos> queen elizabeth : a holy day shall this be kept hereafter : i would to god all strifes were well compounded <eos> my sovereign liege i do beseech your majesty to take our brother clarence to your grace <eos> gloucester : why madam have i offer'd love for this to be so bouted in this royal presence <eos> who knows not that the noble duke is dead <eos> you do him injury to scorn his corse <eos> rivers : who knows not he is dead <eos> who knows he is <eos> queen elizabeth : all seeing heaven what a world is this <eos> buckingham : look i so pale lord dorset as the rest <eos> dorset : ay my good lord and no one in this presence but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks <eos> king edward iv : is clarence dead <eos> the order was reversed <eos> gloucester : but he poor soul by your first order died and that a winged mercury did bear : some tardy cripple bore the countermand that came too lag to see him buried <eos> god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion <eos> dorset : a boon my sovereign for my service done <eos> king edward iv : i pray thee peace : my soul is full of sorrow <eos> dorset : i will not rise unless your highness grant <eos> king edward iv : then speak at once what is it thou demand'st <eos> dorset : the forfeit sovereign of my servant's life who slew to-day a righteous gentleman lately attendant on the duke of norfolk <eos> king edward iv : have a tongue to doom my brother's death and shall the same give pardon to a slave <eos> my brother slew no man his fault was thought and yet his punishment was cruel death <eos> who sued to me for him <eos> who in my rage kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advised who spake of brotherhood <eos> who spake of love <eos> who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty warwick and did fight for me <eos> who told me in the field by tewksbury when oxford had me down he rescued me and said 'dear brother live and be a king' <eos> who told me when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death how he did lap me even in his own garments and gave himself all thin and naked to the numb cold night <eos> all this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you had so much grace to put it in my mind <eos> but when your carters or your waiting-vassals have done a drunken slaughter and defaced the precious image of our dear redeemer you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon and i unjustly too must grant it you but for my brother not a man would speak nor i ungracious speak unto myself for him poor soul <eos> the proudest of you all have been beholding to him in his life yet none of you would once plead for his life <eos> o god i fear thy justice will take hold on me and you and mine and yours for this <eos> come hastings help me to my closet <eos> oh poor clarence <eos> gloucester : this is the fruit of rashness <eos> mark'd you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen look'd pale when they did hear of clarence' death <eos> o they did urge it still unto the king <eos> god will revenge it <eos> but come let us in to comfort edward with our company <eos> buckingham : we wait upon your grace <eos> boy : tell me good grandam is our father dead <eos> duchess of york : no boy <eos> boy : why do you wring your hands and beat your breast and cry 'o clarence my unhappy son <eos>' girl : why do you look on us and shake your head and call us wretches orphans castaways if that our noble father be alive <eos> duchess of york : my pretty cousins you mistake me much i do lament the sickness of the king <eos> as loath to lose him not your father's death it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost <eos> boy : then grandam you conclude that he is dead <eos> the king my uncle is to blame for this : god will revenge it whom i will importune with daily prayers all to that effect <eos> girl : and so will i <eos> duchess of york : peace children peace <eos> the king doth love you well : incapable and shallow innocents you cannot guess who caused your father's death <eos> boy : grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester told me the king provoked by the queen devised impeachments to imprison him : and when my uncle told me so he wept and hugg'd me in his arm and kindly kiss'd my cheek bade me rely on him as on my father and he would love me dearly as his child <eos> duchess of york : oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile <eos> he is my son yea and therein my shame yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit <eos> boy : think you my uncle did dissemble grandam <eos> duchess of york : ay boy <eos> boy : i cannot think it <eos> hark <eos> what noise is this <eos> queen elizabeth : oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep to chide my fortune and torment myself <eos> i'll join with black despair against my soul and to myself become an enemy <eos> duchess of york : what means this scene of rude impatience <eos> queen elizabeth : to make an act of tragic violence : edward my lord your son our king is dead <eos> why grow the branches now the root is wither'd <eos> why wither not the leaves the sap being gone <eos> if you will live lament if die be brief that our swift-winged souls may catch the king's or like obedient subjects follow him to his new kingdom of perpetual rest <eos> duchess of york : ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow as i had title in thy noble husband <eos> i have bewept a worthy husband's death and lived by looking on his images : but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are crack'd in pieces by malignant death and i for comfort have but one false glass which grieves me when i see my shame in him <eos> thou art a widow yet thou art a mother and hast the comfort of thy children left thee : but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs edward and clarence <eos> o what cause have i thine being but a moiety of my grief to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries <eos> boy : good aunt you wept not for our father's death how can we aid you with our kindred tears <eos> girl : our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd your widow-dolour likewise be unwept <eos> queen elizabeth : give me no help in lamentation i am not barren to bring forth complaints all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes that i being govern'd by the watery moon may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world <eos> oh for my husband for my dear lord edward <eos> children : oh for our father for our dear lord clarence <eos> duchess of york : alas for both both mine edward and clarence <eos> queen elizabeth : what stay had i but edward <eos> and he's gone <eos> children : what stay had we but clarence <eos> and he's gone <eos> duchess of york : what stays had i but they <eos> and they are gone <eos> queen elizabeth : was never widow had so dear a loss <eos> children : were never orphans had so dear a loss <eos> duchess of york : was never mother had so dear a loss <eos> alas i am the mother of these moans <eos> their woes are parcell'd mine are general <eos> she for an edward weeps and so do i i for a clarence weep so doth not she : these babes for clarence weep and so do i i for an edward weep so do not they : alas you three on me threefold distress'd pour all your tears <eos> i am your sorrow's nurse and i will pamper it with lamentations <eos> dorset : comfort dear mother : god is much displeased that you take with unthankfulness his doing : in common worldly things 'tis call'd ungrateful with dull unwilligness to repay a debt which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent much more to be thus opposite with heaven for it requires the royal debt it lent you <eos> rivers : madam bethink you like a careful mother of the young prince your son : send straight for him let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives : drown desperate sorrow in dead edward's grave and plant your joys in living edward's throne <eos> gloucester : madam have comfort : all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can cure their harms by wailing them <eos> madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace : humbly on my knee i crave your blessing <eos> duchess of york : god bless thee and put meekness in thy mind love charity obedience and true duty <eos> gloucester : buckingham : you cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers that bear this mutual heavy load of moan now cheer each other in each other's love though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son <eos> the broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts but lately splinter'd knit and join'd together must gently be preserved cherish'd and kept : me seemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch'd hither to london to be crown'd our king <eos> rivers : why with some little train my lord of buckingham <eos> buckingham : marry my lord lest by a multitude the new-heal'd wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd : where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented <eos> gloucester : i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me <eos> rivers : and so in me and so i think in all : yet since it is but green it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach which haply by much company might be urged : therefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince <eos> hastings : and so say i <eos> gloucester : then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow <eos> madam and you my mother will you go to give your censures in this weighty business <eos> queen elizabeth : with all our harts <eos> buckingham : my lord whoever journeys to the prince for god's sake let not us two be behind for by the way i'll sort occasion as index to the story we late talk'd of to part the queen's proud kindred from the king <eos> gloucester : my other self my counsel's consistory my oracle my prophet <eos> my dear cousin i like a child will go by thy direction <eos> towards ludlow then for we'll not stay behind <eos> first citizen : neighbour well met : whither away so fast <eos> second citizen : i promise you i scarcely know myself : hear you the news abroad <eos> first citizen : ay that the king is dead <eos> second citizen : bad news by'r lady seldom comes the better : i fear i fear 'twill prove a troublous world <eos> third citizen : neighbours god speed <eos> first citizen : give you good morrow sir <eos> third citizen : doth this news hold of good king edward's death <eos> second citizen : ay sir it is too true god help the while <eos> third citizen : then masters look to see a troublous world <eos> first citizen : no no by god's good grace his son shall reign <eos> third citizen : woe to the land that's govern'd by a child <eos> second citizen : in him there is a hope of government that in his nonage council under him and in his full and ripen'd years himself no doubt shall then and till then govern well <eos> first citizen : so stood the state when henry the sixth was crown'd in paris but at nine months old <eos> third citizen : stood the state so <eos> no no good friends god wot for then this land was famously enrich'd with politic grave counsel then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace <eos> first citizen : why so hath this both by the father and mother <eos> third citizen : better it were they all came by the father or by the father there were none at all for emulation now who shall be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not <eos> o full of danger is the duke of gloucester <eos> and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud : and were they to be ruled and not to rule this sickly land might solace as before <eos> first citizen : come come we fear the worst all shall be well <eos> third citizen : when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks when great leaves fall the winter is at hand when the sun sets who doth not look for night <eos> untimely storms make men expect a dearth <eos> all may be well but if god sort it so 'tis more than we deserve or i expect <eos> second citizen : truly the souls of men are full of dread : ye cannot reason almost with a man that looks not heavily and full of fear <eos> third citizen : before the times of change still is it so : by a divine instinct men's minds mistrust ensuing dangers as by proof we see the waters swell before a boisterous storm <eos> but leave it all to god <eos> whither away <eos> second citizen : marry we were sent for to the justices <eos> third citizen : and so was i : i'll bear you company <eos> archbishop of york : last night i hear they lay at northampton at stony-stratford will they be to-night : to-morrow or next day they will be here <eos> duchess of york : i long with all my heart to see the prince : i hope he is much grown since last i saw him <eos> queen elizabeth : but i hear no they say my son of york hath almost overta'en him in his growth <eos> york : ay mother but i would not have it so <eos> duchess of york : why my young cousin it is good to grow <eos> york : grandam one night as we did sit at supper my uncle rivers talk'd how i did grow more than my brother : 'ay' quoth my uncle gloucester 'small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace :' and since methinks i would not grow so fast because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste <eos> duchess of york : good faith good faith the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee he was the wretched'st thing when he was young so long a-growing and so leisurely that if this rule were true he should be gracious <eos> archbishop of york : why madam so no doubt he is <eos> duchess of york : i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt <eos> york : now by my troth if i had been remember'd i could have given my uncle's grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine <eos> duchess of york : how my pretty york <eos> i pray thee let me hear it <eos> york : marry they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old 'twas full two years ere i could get a tooth <eos> grandam this would have been a biting jest <eos> duchess of york : i pray thee pretty york who told thee this <eos> york : grandam his nurse <eos> duchess of york : his nurse <eos> why she was dead ere thou wert born <eos> york : if 'twere not she i cannot tell who told me <eos> queen elizabeth : a parlous boy : go to you are too shrewd <eos> archbishop of york : good madam be not angry with the child <eos> queen elizabeth : pitchers have ears <eos> archbishop of york : here comes a messenger <eos> what news <eos> messenger : such news my lord as grieves me to unfold <eos> queen elizabeth : how fares the prince <eos> messenger : well madam and in health <eos> duchess of york : what is thy news then <eos> messenger : lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret with them sir thomas vaughan prisoners <eos> duchess of york : who hath committed them <eos> messenger : the mighty dukes gloucester and buckingham <eos> queen elizabeth : for what offence <eos> messenger : the sum of all i can i have disclosed why or for what these nobles were committed is all unknown to me my gracious lady <eos> queen elizabeth : ay me i see the downfall of our house <eos> the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind insulting tyranny begins to jet upon the innocent and aweless throne : welcome destruction death and massacre <eos> i see as in a map the end of all <eos> duchess of york : accursed and unquiet wrangling days how many of you have mine eyes beheld <eos> my husband lost his life to get the crown and often up and down my sons were toss'd for me to joy and weep their gain and loss : and being seated and domestic broils clean over-blown themselves the conquerors <eos> make war upon themselves blood against blood self against self : o preposterous and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen or let me die to look on death no more <eos> queen elizabeth : come come my boy we will to sanctuary <eos> madam farewell <eos> duchess of york : i'll go along with you <eos> queen elizabeth : you have no cause <eos> archbishop of york : my gracious lady go and thither bear your treasure and your goods <eos> for my part i'll resign unto your grace the seal i keep : and so betide to me as well i tender you and all of yours <eos> come i'll conduct you to the sanctuary <eos> buckingham : welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber <eos> gloucester : welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy <eos> prince edward : no uncle but our crosses on the way have made it tedious wearisome and heavy i want more uncles here to welcome me <eos> gloucester : sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the world's deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart <eos> those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugar'd words but look'd not on the poison of their hearts : god keep you from them and from such false friends <eos> prince edward : god keep me from false friends <eos> but they were none <eos> gloucester : my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you <eos> lord mayor : god bless your grace with health and happy days <eos> prince edward : i thank you good my lord and thank you all <eos> i thought my mother and my brother york would long ere this have met us on the way fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no <eos> buckingham : and in good time here comes the sweating lord <eos> prince edward : welcome my lord : what will our mother come <eos> hastings : on what occasion god he knows not i the queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary : the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace but by his mother was perforce withheld <eos> buckingham : fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers <eos> lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently <eos> if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce <eos> cardinal : my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory can from his mother win the duke of york anon expect him here but if she be obdurate to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary <eos> not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin <eos> buckingham : you are too senseless <eos>obstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him <eos> the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place : this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it : then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there <eos> oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children ne'er till now <eos> cardinal : my lord you shall o'er-rule my mind for once <eos> come on lord hastings will you go with me <eos> hastings : i go my lord <eos> prince edward : good lords make all the speedy haste you may <eos> say uncle gloucester if our brother come where shall we sojourn till our coronation <eos> gloucester : where it seems best unto your royal self <eos> if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower : then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation <eos> prince edward : i do not like the tower of any place <eos> did julius caesar build that place my lord <eos> buckingham : he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have re-edified <eos> prince edward : is it upon record or else reported successively from age to age he built it <eos> buckingham : upon record my gracious lord <eos> prince edward : but say my lord it were not register'd methinks the truth should live from age to age as 'twere retail'd to all posterity even to the general all-ending day <eos> gloucester : prince edward : what say you uncle <eos> gloucester : i say without characters fame lives long <eos> thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word <eos> prince edward : that julius caesar was a famous man with what his valour did enrich his wit his wit set down to make his valour live death makes no conquest of this conqueror for now he lives in fame though not in life <eos> i'll tell you what my cousin buckingham <eos> buckingham : what my gracious lord <eos> prince edward : an if i live until i be a man i'll win our ancient right in france again or die a soldier as i lived a king <eos> gloucester : buckingham : now in good time here comes the duke of york <eos> prince edward : richard of york <eos> how fares our loving brother <eos> york : well my dread lord so must i call you now <eos> prince edward : ay brother to our grief as it is yours : too late he died that might have kept that title which by his death hath lost much majesty <eos> gloucester : how fares our cousin noble lord of york <eos> york : i thank you gentle uncle <eos> o my lord you said that idle weeds are fast in growth the prince my brother hath outgrown me far <eos> gloucester : he hath my lord <eos> york : and therefore is he idle <eos> gloucester : o my fair cousin i must not say so <eos> york : then is he more beholding to you than i <eos> gloucester : he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman <eos> york : i pray you uncle give me this dagger <eos> gloucester : my dagger little cousin <eos> with all my heart <eos> prince edward : a beggar brother <eos> york : of my kind uncle that i know will give and being but a toy which is no grief to give <eos> gloucester : a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin <eos> york : a greater gift <eos> o that's the sword to it <eos> gloucester : a gentle cousin were it light enough <eos> york : o then i see you will part but with light gifts in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay <eos> gloucester : it is too heavy for your grace to wear <eos> york : i weigh it lightly were it heavier <eos> gloucester : what would you have my weapon little lord <eos> york : i would that i might thank you as you call me <eos> gloucester : how <eos> york : little <eos> prince edward : my lord of york will still be cross in talk : uncle your grace knows how to bear with him <eos> york : you mean to bear me not to bear with me : uncle my brother mocks both you and me because that i am little like an ape he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders <eos> buckingham : with what a sharp-provided wit he reasons <eos> to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself : so cunning and so young is wonderful <eos> gloucester : my lord will't please you pass along <eos> myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you <eos> york : what will you go unto the tower my lord <eos> prince edward : my lord protector needs will have it so <eos> york : i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower <eos> gloucester : why what should you fear <eos> york : marry my uncle clarence' angry ghost : my grandam told me he was murdered there <eos> prince edward : i fear no uncles dead <eos> gloucester : nor none that live i hope <eos> prince edward : an if they live i hope i need not fear <eos> but come my lord and with a heavy heart thinking on them go i unto the tower <eos> buckingham : think you my lord this little prating york was not incensed by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously <eos> gloucester : no doubt no doubt o 'tis a parlous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable he is all the mother's from the top to toe <eos> buckingham : well let them rest <eos> come hither catesby <eos> thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart : thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way what think'st thou <eos> is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the instalment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle <eos> catesby : he for his father's sake so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him <eos> buckingham : what think'st thou then of stanley <eos> what will he <eos> catesby : he will do all in all as hastings doth <eos> buckingham : well then no more but this : go gentle catesby and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings how doth he stand affected to our purpose and summon him to-morrow to the tower to sit about the coronation <eos> if thou dost find him tractable to us encourage him and show him all our reasons : if he be leaden icy-cold unwilling be thou so too and so break off your talk and give us notice of his inclination : for we to-morrow hold divided councils wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd <eos> gloucester : commend me to lord william : tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries to-morrow are let blood at pomfret-castle and bid my friend for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more <eos> buckingham : good catesby go effect this business soundly <eos> catesby : my good lords both with all the heed i may <eos> gloucester : shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep <eos> catesby : you shall my lord <eos> gloucester : at crosby place there shall you find us both <eos> buckingham : now my lord what shall we do if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots <eos> gloucester : chop off his head man somewhat we will do : and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and the moveables whereof the king my brother stood possess'd <eos> buckingham : i'll claim that promise at your grace's hands <eos> gloucester : and look to have it yielded with all willingness <eos> come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form <eos> messenger : what ho <eos> my lord <eos> hastings : messenger : a messenger from the lord stanley <eos> hastings : what is't o'clock <eos> messenger : upon the stroke of four <eos> hastings : cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights <eos> messenger : so it should seem by that i have to say <eos> first he commends him to your noble lordship <eos> hastings : and then <eos> messenger : and then he sends you word he dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm : besides he says there are two councils held and that may be determined at the one which may make you and him to rue at the other <eos> therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure if presently you will take horse with him and with all speed post with him toward the north to shun the danger that his soul divines <eos> hastings : go fellow go return unto thy lord bid him not fear the separated councils his honour and myself are at the one and at the other is my servant catesby where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence <eos> tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance : and for his dreams i wonder he is so fond to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers to fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase <eos> go bid thy master rise and come to me and we will both together to the tower where he shall see the boar will use us kindly <eos> messenger : my gracious lord i'll tell him what you say <eos> catesby : many good morrows to my noble lord <eos> hastings : good morrow catesby you are early stirring what news what news in this our tottering state <eos> catesby : it is a reeling world indeed my lord and i believe twill never stand upright tim richard wear the garland of the realm <eos> hastings : how <eos> wear the garland <eos> dost thou mean the crown <eos> catesby : ay my good lord <eos> hastings : i'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced <eos> but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it <eos> catesby : ay on my life and hopes to find forward upon his party for the gain thereof : and thereupon he sends you this good news that this same very day your enemies the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret <eos> hastings : indeed i am no mourner for that news because they have been still mine enemies : but that i'll give my voice on richard's side to bar my master's heirs in true descent god knows i will not do it to the death <eos> catesby : god keep your lordship in that gracious mind <eos> hastings : but i shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence that they who brought me in my master's hate i live to look upon their tragedy <eos> i tell thee catesby <eos> catesby : what my lord <eos> hastings : ere a fortnight make me elder i'll send some packing that yet think not on it <eos> catesby : 'tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord when men are unprepared and look not for it <eos> hastings : o monstrous monstrous <eos> and so falls it out with rivers vaughan grey : and so 'twill do with some men else who think themselves as safe as thou and i who as thou know'st are dear to princely richard and to buckingham <eos> catesby : the princes both make high account of you for they account his head upon the bridge <eos> hastings : i know they do and i have well deserved it <eos> come on come on where is your boar-spear man <eos> fear you the boar and go so unprovided <eos> stanley : my lord good morrow good morrow catesby : you may jest on but by the holy rood i do not like these several councils i <eos> hastings : my lord i hold my life as dear as you do yours and never in my life i do protest was it more precious to me than 'tis now : think you but that i know our state secure i would be so triumphant as i am <eos> stanley : the lords at pomfret when they rode from london were jocund and supposed their state was sure and they indeed had no cause to mistrust but yet you see how soon the day o'ercast <eos> this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt : pray god i say i prove a needless coward <eos> what shall we toward the tower <eos> the day is spent <eos> hastings : come come have with you <eos> wot you what my lord <eos> to-day the lords you talk of are beheaded <eos> lord stanley : they for their truth might better wear their heads than some that have accused them wear their hats <eos> but come my lord let us away <eos> hastings : go on before i'll talk with this good fellow <eos> how now sirrah <eos> how goes the world with thee <eos> pursuivant : the better that your lordship please to ask <eos> hastings : i tell thee man 'tis better with me now than when i met thee last where now we meet : then was i going prisoner to the tower by the suggestion of the queen's allies but now i tell thee <eos>keep it to thyself <eos> this day those enemies are put to death and i in better state than e'er i was <eos> pursuivant : god hold it to your honour's good content <eos> hastings : gramercy fellow : there drink that for me <eos> pursuivant : god save your lordship <eos> priest : well met my lord i am glad to see your honour <eos> hastings : i thank thee good sir john with all my heart <eos> i am in your debt for your last exercise come the next sabbath and i will content you <eos> buckingham : what talking with a priest lord chamberlain <eos> your friends at pomfret they do need the priest your honour hath no shriving work in hand <eos> hastings : good faith and when i met this holy man those men you talk of came into my mind <eos> what go you toward the tower <eos> buckingham : i do my lord but long i shall not stay i shall return before your lordship thence <eos> hastings : 'tis like enough for i stay dinner there <eos> buckingham : hastings : i'll wait upon your lordship <eos> ratcliff : come bring forth the prisoners <eos> rivers : sir richard ratcliff let me tell thee this : to-day shalt thou behold a subject die for truth for duty and for loyalty <eos> grey : god keep the prince from all the pack of you <eos> a knot you are of damned blood-suckers <eos> vaughan : you live that shall cry woe for this after <eos> ratcliff : dispatch the limit of your lives is out <eos> rivers : o pomfret pomfret <eos> o thou bloody prison fatal and ominous to noble peers <eos> within the guilty closure of thy walls richard the second here was hack'd to death and for more slander to thy dismal seat we give thee up our guiltless blood to drink <eos> grey : now margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads for standing by when richard stabb'd her son <eos> rivers : then cursed she hastings then cursed she buckingham then cursed she richard <eos> o remember god to hear her prayers for them as now for us and for my sister and her princely sons be satisfied dear god with our true blood which as thou know'st unjustly must be spilt <eos> ratcliff : make haste the hour of death is expiate <eos> rivers : come grey come vaughan let us all embrace : and take our leave until we meet in heaven <eos> hastings : my lords at once : the cause why we are met is to determine of the coronation <eos> in god's name speak : when is the royal day <eos> buckingham : are all things fitting for that royal time <eos> derby : it is and wants but nomination <eos> bishop of ely : to-morrow then i judge a happy day <eos> buckingham : who knows the lord protector's mind herein <eos> who is most inward with the royal duke <eos> bishop of ely : your grace we think should soonest know his mind <eos> buckingham : who i my lord i we know each other's faces but for our hearts he knows no more of mine than i of yours nor i no more of his than you of mine <eos> lord hastings you and he are near in love <eos> hastings : i thank his grace i know he loves me well but for his purpose in the coronation <eos> i have not sounded him nor he deliver'd his gracious pleasure any way therein : but you my noble lords may name the time and in the duke's behalf i'll give my voice which i presume he'll take in gentle part <eos> bishop of ely : now in good time here comes the duke himself <eos> gloucester : my noble lords and cousins all good morrow <eos> i have been long a sleeper but i hope my absence doth neglect no great designs which by my presence might have been concluded <eos> buckingham : had not you come upon your cue my lord william lord hastings had pronounced your part <eos> i mean your voice <eos>for crowning of the king <eos> gloucester : than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well <eos> hastings : i thank your grace <eos> gloucester : my lord of ely <eos> bishop of ely : my lord <eos> gloucester : when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them <eos> bishop of ely : marry and will my lord with all my heart <eos> gloucester : cousin of buckingham a word with you <eos> catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot as he will lose his head ere give consent his master's son as worshipful as he terms it shall lose the royalty of england's throne <eos> buckingham : withdraw you hence my lord i'll follow you <eos> derby : we have not yet set down this day of triumph <eos> to-morrow in mine opinion is too sudden for i myself am not so well provided as else i would be were the day prolong'd <eos> bishop of ely : where is my lord protector <eos> i have sent for these strawberries <eos> hastings : his grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day there's some conceit or other likes him well when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit <eos> i think there's never a man in christendom that can less hide his love or hate than he for by his face straight shall you know his heart <eos> derby : what of his heart perceive you in his face by any likelihood he show'd to-day <eos> hastings : marry that with no man here he is offended for were he he had shown it in his looks <eos> derby : i pray god he be not i say <eos> gloucester : i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd upon my body with their hellish charms <eos> hastings : the tender love i bear your grace my lord makes me most forward in this noble presence to doom the offenders whatsoever they be i say my lord they have deserved death <eos> gloucester : then be your eyes the witness of this ill : see how i am bewitch'd behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling wither'd up : and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me <eos> hastings : if they have done this thing my gracious lord <eos> gloucester : if i thou protector of this damned strumpet <eos> tellest thou me of 'ifs' <eos> thou art a traitor : off with his head <eos> now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same <eos> lovel and ratcliff look that it be done : the rest that love me rise and follow me <eos> hastings : woe woe for england <eos> not a whit for me for i too fond might have prevented this <eos> stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm but i disdain'd it and did scorn to fly : three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble and startled when he look'd upon the tower as loath to bear me to the slaughter-house <eos> o now i want the priest that spake to me : i now repent i told the pursuivant as 'twere triumphing at mine enemies how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd and i myself secure in grace and favour <eos> o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings' wretched head <eos> ratcliff : dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner : make a short shrift he longs to see your head <eos> hastings : o momentary grace of mortal men which we more hunt for than the grace of god <eos> who builds his hopes in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep <eos> lovel : come come dispatch 'tis bootless to exclaim <eos> hastings : o bloody richard <eos> miserable england <eos> i prophesy the fearful'st time to thee that ever wretched age hath look'd upon <eos> come lead me to the block bear him my head <eos> they smile at me that shortly shall be dead <eos> gloucester : come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in the middle of a word and then begin again and stop again as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror <eos> buckingham : tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion : ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems <eos> but what is catesby gone <eos> gloucester : he is and see he brings the mayor along <eos> buckingham : lord mayor <eos> gloucester : look to the drawbridge there <eos> buckingham : hark <eos> a drum <eos> gloucester : catesby o'erlook the walls <eos> buckingham : lord mayor the reason we have sent <eos> gloucester : look back defend thee here are enemies <eos> buckingham : god and our innocency defend and guard us <eos> gloucester : be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel <eos> lovel : here is the head of that ignoble traitor the dangerous and unsuspected hastings <eos> gloucester : so dear i loved the man that i must weep <eos> i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts : so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shore's wife he lived from all attainder of suspect <eos> buckingham : well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor that ever lived <eos> would you imagine or almost believe were't not that by great preservation we live to tell it you the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the council-house to murder me and my good lord of gloucester <eos> lord mayor : what had he so <eos> gloucester : what think you we are turks or infidels <eos> or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villain's death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons' safety enforced us to this execution <eos> lord mayor : now fair befall you <eos> he deserved his death and you my good lords both have well proceeded to warn false traitors from the like attempts <eos> i never look'd for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore <eos> gloucester : yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning have prevented : because my lord we would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death <eos> lord mayor : but my good lord your grace's word shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak and doubt you not right noble princes both but i'll acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this cause <eos> gloucester : and to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here to avoid the carping censures of the world <eos> buckingham : but since you come too late of our intents yet witness what you hear we did intend : and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell <eos> gloucester : go after after cousin buckingham <eos> the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post : there at your meet'st advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward's children : tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so <eos> moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants daughters wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control listed to make his prey <eos> nay for a need thus far come near my person : tell them when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father : but touch this sparingly as 'twere far off because you know my lord my mother lives <eos> buckingham : fear not my lord i'll play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself : and so my lord adieu <eos> gloucester : if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well-learned bishops <eos> buckingham : i go : and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the guildhall affords <eos> gloucester : go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard's castle <eos> now will i in to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes <eos> scrivener : this is the indictment of the good lord hastings which in a set hand fairly is engross'd that it may be this day read over in paul's <eos> and mark how well the sequel hangs together : eleven hours i spent to write it over for yesternight by catesby was it brought me the precedent was full as long a-doing : and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings untainted unexamined free at liberty here's a good world the while <eos> why who's so gross that seeth not this palpable device <eos> yet who's so blind but says he sees it not <eos> bad is the world and all will come to nought when such bad dealings must be seen in thought <eos> gloucester : how now my lord what say the citizens <eos> buckingham : now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum and speak not a word <eos> gloucester : touch'd you the bastardy of edward's children <eos> buckingham : i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france the insatiate greediness of his desires and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your dicipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility : indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory grew to an end i bid them that did love their country's good cry 'god save richard england's royal king <eos>' gloucester : ah <eos> and did they so <eos> buckingham : no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones gazed each on other and look'd deadly pale <eos> which when i saw i reprehended them and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence : his answer was the people were not wont to be spoke to but by the recorder <eos> then he was urged to tell my tale again 'thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd' but nothing spake in warrant from himself <eos> when he had done some followers of mine own at the lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps and some ten voices cried 'god save king richard <eos>' and thus i took the vantage of those few 'thanks gentle citizens and friends' quoth i 'this general applause and loving shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard :' and even here brake off and came away <eos> gloucester : what tongueless blocks were they <eos> would not they speak <eos> buckingham : no by my troth my lord <eos> gloucester : will not the mayor then and his brethren come <eos> buckingham : the mayor is here at hand : intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit : and look you get a prayer-book in your hand and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord for on that ground i'll build a holy descant : and be not easily won to our request : play the maid's part still answer nay and take it <eos> gloucester : i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt well bring it to a happy issue <eos> buckingham : go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks <eos> welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal <eos> here comes his servant : how now catesby what says he <eos> catesby : my lord : he doth entreat your grace to visit him to-morrow or next day : he is within with two right reverend fathers divinely bent to meditation and no worldly suit would he be moved to draw him from his holy exercise <eos> buckingham : return good catesby to thy lord again tell him myself the mayor and citizens in deep designs and matters of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace <eos> catesby : i'll tell him what you say my lord <eos> buckingham : ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward <eos> he is not lolling on a lewd day-bed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul : happy were england would this gracious prince take on himself the sovereignty thereof : but sure i fear we shall ne'er win him to it <eos> lord mayor : marry god forbid his grace should say us nay <eos> buckingham : i fear he will <eos> how now catesby what says your lord <eos> catesby : my lord he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him his grace not being warn'd thereof before : my lord he fears you mean no good to him <eos> buckingham : sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him : by heaven i come in perfect love to him and so once more return and tell his grace <eos> when holy and devout religious men are at their beads 'tis hard to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation <eos> lord mayor : see where he stands between two clergymen <eos> buckingham : two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity : and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man <eos> famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ears to our request and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal <eos> gloucester : my lord there needs no such apology : i rather do beseech you pardon me who earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends <eos> but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure <eos> buckingham : even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovern'd isle <eos> gloucester : i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the city's eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance <eos> buckingham : you have my lord : would it might please your grace at our entreaties to amend that fault <eos> gloucester : else wherefore breathe i in a christian land <eos> buckingham : then know it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the scepter'd office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock : whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our country's good this noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion <eos> which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for another's gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own <eos> for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just suit come i to move your grace <eos> gloucester : i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof <eos> best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tongue-tied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so season'd with your faithful love to me <eos> then on the other side i cheque'd my friends <eos> therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you <eos> your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request <eos> first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smother'd <eos> but god be thank'd there's no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign <eos> on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him <eos> buckingham : my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered <eos> you say that edward is your brother's son : so say we too but not by edward's wife for first he was contract to lady lucy <eos> your mother lives a witness to that vow <eos> and afterward by substitute betroth'd to bona sister to the king of france <eos> these both put by a poor petitioner a care-crazed mother of a many children a beauty-waning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his lustful eye seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners term the prince <eos> more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue <eos> then good my lord take to your royal self this proffer'd benefit of dignity if non to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal true-derived course <eos> lord mayor : do good my lord your citizens entreat you <eos> buckingham : refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love <eos> catesby : o make them joyful grant their lawful suit <eos> gloucester : alas why would you heap these cares on me <eos> i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you <eos> buckingham : if you refuse it <eos>as in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brother's son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kin and egally indeed to all estates <eos> yet whether you accept our suit or no your brother's son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house : and in this resolution here we leave you <eos> <eos> come citizens : 'zounds <eos> i'll entreat no more <eos> gloucester : o do not swear my lord of buckingham <eos> catesby : call them again my lord and accept their suit <eos> another : do good my lord lest all the land do rue it <eos> gloucester : would you enforce me to a world of care <eos> well call them again <eos> i am not made of stone but penetrable to your <eos> kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul <eos> cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load : but if black scandal or foul-faced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof <eos> lord mayor : god bless your grace <eos> we see it and will say it <eos> gloucester : in saying so you shall but say the truth <eos> buckingham : then i salute you with this kingly title : long live richard england's royal king <eos> lord mayor : amen <eos> buckingham : to-morrow will it please you to be crown'd <eos> gloucester : even when you please since you will have it so <eos> buckingham : to-morrow then we will attend your grace : and so most joyfully we take our leave <eos> gloucester : come let us to our holy task again <eos> farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends <eos> duchess of york : who meets us here <eos> my niece plantagenet led in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester <eos> now for my life she's wandering to the tower on pure heart's love to greet the tender princes <eos> daughter well met <eos> lady anne : god give your graces both a happy and a joyful time of day <eos> queen elizabeth : as much to you good sister <eos> whither away <eos> lady anne : no farther than the tower and as i guess upon the like devotion as yourselves to

how doth the prince and my young son of york <eos> brakenbury : right well dear madam <eos> by your patience i may not suffer you to visit them the king hath straitly charged the contrary <eos> queen elizabeth : the king <eos> why who's that <eos> brakenbury : i cry you mercy : i mean the lord protector <eos> queen elizabeth : the lord protect him from that kingly title <eos> hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me <eos> i am their mother who should keep me from them <eos> duchess of york : i am their fathers mother i will see them <eos> lady anne : their aunt i am in law in love their mother : then bring me to their sights i'll bear thy blame and take thy office from thee on my peril <eos> brakenbury : no madam no i may not leave it so : i am bound by oath and therefore pardon me <eos> lord stanley : let me but meet you ladies one hour hence and i'll salute your grace of york as mother and reverend looker on of two fair queens <eos> come madam you must straight to westminster there to be crowned richard's royal queen <eos> queen elizabeth : o cut my lace in sunder that my pent heart may have some scope to beat or else i swoon with this dead-killing news <eos> lady anne : despiteful tidings <eos> o unpleasing news <eos> dorset : be of good cheer : mother how fares your grace <eos> queen elizabeth : o dorset speak not to me get thee hence <eos> death and destruction dog thee at the heels thy mother's name is ominous to children <eos> if thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas and live with richmond from the reach of hell go hie thee hie thee from this slaughter-house lest thou increase the number of the dead and make me die the thrall of margaret's curse nor mother wife nor england's counted queen <eos> lord stanley : full of wise care is this your counsel madam <eos> take all the swift advantage of the hours you shall have letters from me to my son to meet you on the way and welcome you <eos> be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay <eos> duchess of york : o ill-dispersing wind of misery <eos> o my accursed womb the bed of death <eos> a cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world whose unavoided eye is murderous <eos> lord stanley : come madam come i in all haste was sent <eos> lady anne : and i in all unwillingness will go <eos> i would to god that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were red-hot steel to sear me to the brain <eos> anointed let me be with deadly venom and die ere men can say god save the queen <eos> queen elizabeth : go go poor soul i envy not thy glory to feed my humour wish thyself no harm <eos> lady anne : no <eos> why <eos> when he that is my husband now came to me as i follow'd henry's corse when scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands which issued from my other angel husband and that dead saint which then i weeping follow'd o when i say i look'd on richard's face this was my wish : 'be thou' quoth i ' accursed for making me so young so old a widow <eos> and when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed and be thy wife <eos>if any be so mad <eos> as miserable by the life of thee as thou hast made me by my dear lord's death <eos> lo ere i can repeat this curse again even in so short a space my woman's heart grossly grew captive to his honey words and proved the subject of my own soul's curse which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest for never yet one hour in his bed have i enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep but have been waked by his timorous dreams <eos> besides he hates me for my father warwick and will no doubt shortly be rid of me <eos> queen elizabeth : poor heart adieu <eos> i pity thy complaining <eos> lady anne : no more than from my soul i mourn for yours <eos> queen elizabeth : farewell thou woful welcomer of glory <eos> lady anne : adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it <eos> duchess of york : queen elizabeth : stay yet look back with me unto the tower <eos> pity you ancient stones those tender babes whom envy hath immured within your walls <eos> rough cradle for such little pretty ones <eos> rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow for tender princes use my babies well <eos> so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell <eos> king richard iii : stand all apart cousin of buckingham <eos> buckingham : my gracious sovereign <eos> king richard iii : give me thy hand <eos> thus high by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated but shall we wear these honours for a day <eos> or shall they last and we rejoice in them <eos> buckingham : still live they and for ever may they last <eos> king richard iii : o buckingham now do i play the touch to try if thou be current gold indeed young edward lives : think now what i would say <eos> buckingham : say on my loving lord <eos> king richard iii : why buckingham i say i would be king buckingham : why so you are my thrice renowned liege <eos> king richard iii : ha <eos> am i king <eos> 'tis so : but edward lives <eos> buckingham : true noble prince <eos> king richard iii : o bitter consequence that edward still should live <eos> 'true noble prince <eos>' cousin thou wert not wont to be so dull : shall i be plain <eos> i wish the bastards dead and i would have it suddenly perform'd <eos> what sayest thou <eos> speak suddenly be brief <eos> buckingham : your grace may do your pleasure <eos> king richard iii : tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezeth : say have i thy consent that they shall die <eos> buckingham : give me some breath some little pause my lord before i positively herein : i will resolve your grace immediately <eos> catesby : king richard iii : i will converse with iron-witted fools and unrespective boys : none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes : high-reaching buckingham grows circumspect <eos> boy <eos> page : my lord <eos> king richard iii : know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold would tempt unto a close exploit of death <eos> page : my lord i know a discontented gentleman whose humble means match not his haughty mind : gold were as good as twenty orators and will no doubt tempt him to any thing <eos> king richard iii : what is his name <eos> page : his name my lord is tyrrel <eos> king richard iii : i partly know the man : go call him hither <eos> the deep-revolving witty buckingham no more shall be the neighbour to my counsel : hath he so long held out with me untired and stops he now for breath <eos> how now <eos> what news with you <eos> stanley : my lord i hear the marquis dorset's fled to richmond in those parts beyond the sea where he abides <eos> king richard iii : catesby <eos> catesby : my lord <eos> king richard iii : rumour it abroad that anne my wife is sick and like to die : i will take order for her keeping close <eos> inquire me out some mean-born gentleman whom i will marry straight to clarence' daughter : the boy is foolish and i fear not him <eos> look how thou dream'st <eos> i say again give out that anne my wife is sick and like to die : about it for it stands me much upon to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me <eos> i must be married to my brother's daughter or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass <eos> murder her brothers and then marry her <eos> uncertain way of gain <eos> but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin : tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye <eos> is thy name tyrrel <eos> tyrrel : james tyrrel and your most obedient subject <eos> king richard iii : art thou indeed <eos> tyrrel : prove me my gracious sovereign <eos> king richard iii : darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine <eos> tyrrel : ay my lord but i had rather kill two enemies <eos> king richard iii : why there thou hast it : two deep enemies foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers are they that i would have thee deal upon : tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower <eos> tyrrel : let me have open means to come to them and soon i'll rid you from the fear of them <eos> king richard iii : thou sing'st sweet music <eos> hark come hither tyrrel go by this token : rise and lend thine ear : there is no more but so : say it is done and i will love thee and prefer thee too <eos> tyrrel : 'tis done my gracious lord <eos> king richard iii : shall we hear from thee tyrrel ere we sleep <eos> tyrrel : ye shall my lord <eos> buckingham : my lord i have consider'd in my mind the late demand that you did sound me in <eos> king richard iii : well let that pass <eos> dorset is fled to richmond <eos> buckingham : i hear that news my lord <eos> king richard iii : stanley he is your wife's son well look to it <eos> buckingham : my lord i claim your gift my due by promise for which your honour and your faith is pawn'd the earldom of hereford and the moveables the which you promised i should possess <eos> king richard iii : stanley look to your wife if she convey letters to richmond you shall answer it <eos> buckingham : what says your highness to my just demand <eos> king richard iii : as i remember henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy <eos> a king perhaps perhaps <eos> buckingham : my lord <eos> king richard iii : how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me i being by that i should kill him <eos> buckingham : my lord your promise for the earldom <eos> king richard iii : richmond <eos> when last i was at exeter the mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle and call'd it rougemont : at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond <eos> buckingham : my lord <eos> king richard iii : ay what's o'clock <eos> buckingham : i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me <eos> king richard iii : well but what's o'clock <eos> buckingham : upon the stroke of ten <eos> king richard iii : well let it strike <eos> buckingham : why let it strike <eos> king richard iii : because that like a jack thou keep'st the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation <eos> i am not in the giving vein to-day <eos> buckingham : why then resolve me whether you will or no <eos> king richard iii : tut tut thou troublest me am not in the vein <eos> buckingham : is it even so <eos> rewards he my true service with such deep contempt made i him king for this <eos> o let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock while my fearful head is on <eos> tyrrel : the tyrannous and bloody deed is done <eos> the most arch of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of <eos> dighton and forrest whom i did suborn to do this ruthless piece of butchery although they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs melting with tenderness and kind compassion wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories <eos> 'lo thus' quoth dighton 'lay those tender babes :' 'thus thus' quoth forrest 'girdling one another within their innocent alabaster arms : their lips were four red roses on a stalk which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other <eos> a book of prayers on their pillow lay which once' quoth forrest 'almost changed my mind but o <eos> the devil' <eos>there the villain stopp'd whilst dighton thus told on : 'we smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature that from the prime creation e'er she framed <eos>' thus both are gone with conscience and remorse they could not speak and so i left them both to bring this tidings to the bloody king <eos> and here he comes <eos> all hail my sovereign liege <eos> king richard iii : kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news <eos> tyrrel : if to have done the thing you gave in charge beget your happiness be happy then for it is done my lord <eos> king richard iii : but didst thou see them dead <eos> tyrrel : i did my lord <eos> king richard iii : and buried gentle tyrrel <eos> tyrrel : the chaplain of the tower hath buried them but how or in what place i do not know <eos> king richard iii : come to me tyrrel soon at after supper and thou shalt tell the process of their death <eos> meantime but think how i may do thee good and be inheritor of thy desire <eos> farewell till soon <eos> the son of clarence have i pent up close his daughter meanly have i match'd in marriage the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom and anne my wife hath bid the world good night <eos> now for i know the breton richmond aims at young elizabeth my brother's daughter and by that knot looks proudly o'er the crown to her i go a jolly thriving wooer <eos> catesby : my lord <eos> king richard iii : good news or bad that thou comest in so bluntly <eos> catesby : bad news my lord : ely is fled to richmond and buckingham back'd with the hardy welshmen is in the field and still his power increaseth <eos> king richard iii : ely with richmond troubles me more near than buckingham and his rash-levied army <eos> come i have heard that fearful commenting is leaden servitor to dull delay delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary then fiery expedition be my wing jove's mercury and herald for a king <eos> come muster men : my counsel is my shield we must be brief when traitors brave the field <eos> queen margaret : so now prosperity begins to mellow and drop into the rotten mouth of death <eos> here in these confines slily have i lurk'd to watch the waning of mine adversaries <eos> a dire induction am i witness to and will to france hoping the consequence will prove as bitter black and tragical <eos> withdraw thee wretched margaret : who comes here <eos> queen elizabeth : ah my young princes <eos> ah my tender babes <eos> my unblown flowers new-appearing sweets <eos> if yet your gentle souls fly in the air and be not fix'd in doom perpetual hover about me with your airy wings and hear your mother's lamentation <eos> queen margaret : hover about her say that right for right hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night <eos> duchess of york : so many miseries have crazed my voice that my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb edward plantagenet why art thou dead <eos> queen margaret : plantagenet doth quit plantagenet <eos> edward for edward pays a dying debt <eos> queen elizabeth : wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs and throw them in the entrails of the wolf <eos> when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done <eos> queen margaret : when holy harry died and my sweet son <eos> duchess of york : blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd brief abstract and record of tedious days rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood <eos> queen elizabeth : o that thou wouldst as well afford a grave as thou canst yield a melancholy seat <eos> then would i hide my bones not rest them here <eos> o who hath any cause to mourn but i <eos> queen margaret : if ancient sorrow be most reverend give mine the benefit of seniory and let my woes frown on the upper hand <eos> if sorrow can admit society tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine : i had an edward till a richard kill'd him i had a harry till a richard kill'd him : thou hadst an edward till a richard kill'd him thou hadst a richard till a richard killed him duchess of york : i had a richard too and thou didst kill him i had a rutland too thou holp'st to kill him <eos> queen margaret : thou hadst a clarence too and richard kill'd him <eos> from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept a hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death : that dog that had his teeth before his eyes to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood that foul defacer of god's handiwork that excellent grand tyrant of the earth that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves <eos> o upright just and true-disposing god how do i thank thee that this carnal cur preys on the issue of his mother's body and makes her pew-fellow with others' moan <eos> duchess of york : o harry's wife triumph not in my woes <eos> god witness with me i have wept for thine <eos> queen margaret : bear with me i am hungry for revenge and now i cloy me with beholding it <eos> thy edward he is dead that stabb'd my edward : thy other edward dead to quit my edward young york he is but boot because both they match not the high perfection of my loss : thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my edward and the beholders of this tragic play the adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey untimely smother'd in their dusky graves <eos> richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer only reserved their factor to buy souls and send them thither : but at hand at hand ensues his piteous and unpitied end : earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray <eos> to have him suddenly convey'd away <eos> cancel his bond of life dear god i prey that i may live to say the dog is dead <eos> queen elizabeth : o thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me curse that bottled spider that foul bunch-back'd toad <eos> queen margaret : i call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune i call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen the presentation of but what i was the flattering index of a direful pageant one heaved a-high to be hurl'd down below a mother only mock'd with two sweet babes a dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble a sign of dignity a garish flag to be the aim of every dangerous shot a queen in jest only to fill the scene <eos> where is thy husband now <eos> where be thy brothers <eos> where are thy children <eos> wherein dost thou joy <eos> who sues to thee and cries 'god save the queen' <eos> where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee <eos> where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee <eos> decline all this and see what now thou art : for happy wife a most distressed widow for joyful mother one that wails the name for queen a very caitiff crown'd with care for one being sued to one that humbly sues for one that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me for one being fear'd of all now fearing one for one commanding all obey'd of none <eos> thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about and left thee but a very prey to time having no more but thought of what thou wert to torture thee the more being what thou art <eos> thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow <eos> now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke from which even here i slip my weary neck and leave the burthen of it all on thee <eos> farewell york's wife and queen of sad mischance : these english woes will make me smile in france <eos> queen elizabeth : o thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile and teach me how to curse mine enemies <eos> queen margaret : forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days compare dead happiness with living woe think that thy babes were fairer than they were and he that slew them fouler than he is : bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse : revolving this will teach thee how to curse <eos> queen elizabeth : my words are dull o quicken them with thine <eos> queen margaret : thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine <eos> duchess of york : why should calamity be full of words <eos> queen elizabeth : windy attorneys to their client woes airy succeeders of intestate joys poor breathing orators of miseries <eos> let them have scope : though what they do impart help not all yet do they ease the heart <eos> duchess of york : if so then be not tongue-tied : go with me <eos> and in the breath of bitter words let's smother my damned son which thy two sweet sons smother'd <eos> i hear his drum : be copious in exclaims <eos> king richard iii : who intercepts my expedition <eos> duchess of york : o she that might have intercepted thee by strangling thee in her accursed womb from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done <eos> queen elizabeth : hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown where should be graven if that right were right the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown and the dire death of my two sons and brothers <eos> tell me thou villain slave where are my children <eos> duchess of york : thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence <eos> and little ned plantagenet his son <eos> queen elizabeth : where is kind hastings rivers vaughan grey <eos> king richard iii : a flourish trumpets <eos> strike alarum drums <eos> let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women rail on the lord's enointed : strike i say <eos> either be patient and entreat me fair or with the clamorous report of war thus will i drown your exclamations <eos> duchess of york : art thou my son <eos> king richard iii : ay i thank god my father and yourself <eos> duchess of york : then patiently hear my impatience <eos> king richard iii : madam i have a touch of your condition which cannot brook the accent of reproof <eos> duchess of york : o let me speak <eos> king richard iii : do then : but i'll not hear <eos> duchess of york : i will be mild and gentle in my speech <eos> king richard iii : and brief good mother for i am in haste <eos> duchess of york : art thou so hasty <eos> i have stay'd for thee god knows in anguish pain and agony <eos> king richard iii : and came i not at last to comfort you <eos> duchess of york : no by the holy rood thou know'st it well thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell <eos> a grievous burthen was thy birth to me tetchy and wayward was thy infancy thy school-days frightful desperate wild and furious thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous thy age confirm'd proud subdued bloody treacherous more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred : what comfortable hour canst thou name that ever graced me in thy company <eos> king richard iii : faith none but humphrey hour that call'd your grace to breakfast once forth of my company <eos> if i be so disgracious in your sight let me march on and not offend your grace <eos> strike the drum <eos> duchess of york : i prithee hear me speak <eos> king richard iii : you speak too bitterly <eos> duchess of york : hear me a word for i shall never speak to thee again <eos> king richard iii : so <eos> duchess of york : either thou wilt die by god's just ordinance ere from this war thou turn a conqueror or i with grief and extreme age shall perish and never look upon thy face again <eos> therefore take with thee my most heavy curse which in the day of battle tire thee more than all the complete armour that thou wear'st <eos> my prayers on the adverse party fight and there the little souls of edward's children whisper the spirits of thine enemies and promise them success and victory <eos> bloody thou art bloody will be thy end shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend <eos> queen elizabeth : though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse abides in me i say amen to all <eos> king richard iii : stay madam i must speak a word with you <eos> queen elizabeth : i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to murder : for my daughters richard they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens and therefore level not to hit their lives <eos> king richard iii : you have a daughter call'd elizabeth virtuous and fair royal and gracious <eos> queen elizabeth : and must she die for this <eos> o let her live and i'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty slander myself as false to edward's bed throw over her the veil of infamy : so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter i will confess she was not edward's daughter <eos> king richard iii : wrong not her birth she is of royal blood <eos> queen elizabeth : to save her life i'll say she is not so <eos> king richard iii : her life is only safest in her birth <eos> queen elizabeth : and only in that safety died her brothers <eos> king richard iii : lo at their births good stars were opposite <eos> queen elizabeth : no to their lives bad friends were contrary <eos> king richard iii : all unavoided is the doom of destiny <eos> queen elizabeth : true when avoided grace makes destiny : my babes were destined to a fairer death if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life <eos> king richard iii : you speak as if that i had slain my cousins <eos> queen elizabeth : cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen'd of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life <eos> whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts thy head all indirectly gave direction : no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart to revel in the entrails of my lambs <eos> but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes and i in such a desperate bay of death like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom <eos> king richard iii : madam so thrive i in my enterprise and dangerous success of bloody wars as i intend more good to you and yours than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd <eos> queen elizabeth : what good is cover'd with the face of heaven to be discover'd that can do me good <eos> king richard iii : the advancement of your children gentle lady <eos> queen elizabeth : up to some scaffold there to lose their heads <eos> king richard iii : no to the dignity and height of honour the high imperial type of this earth's glory <eos> queen elizabeth : flatter my sorrows with report of it tell me what state what dignity what honour canst thou demise to any child of mine <eos> king richard iii : even all i have yea and myself and all will i withal endow a child of thine so in the lethe of thy angry soul thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs which thou supposest i have done to thee <eos> queen elizabeth : be brief lest that be process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness' date <eos> king richard iii : then know that from my soul i love thy daughter <eos> queen elizabeth : my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul <eos> king richard iii : what do you think <eos> queen elizabeth : that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul : so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it <eos> king richard iii : be not so hasty to confound my meaning : i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter and mean to make her queen of england <eos> queen elizabeth : say then who dost thou mean shall be her king <eos> king richard iii : even he that makes her queen who should be else <eos> queen elizabeth : what thou <eos> king richard iii : i even i : what think you of it madam <eos> queen elizabeth : how canst thou woo her <eos> king richard iii : that would i learn of you as one that are best acquainted with her humour <eos> queen elizabeth : and wilt thou learn of me <eos> king richard iii : madam with all my heart <eos> queen elizabeth : send to her by the man that slew her brothers a pair of bleeding-hearts thereon engrave edward and york then haply she will weep : therefore present to her <eos>as sometime margaret did to thy father steep'd in rutland's blood <eos> a handkerchief which say to her did drain the purple sap from her sweet brother's body and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith <eos> if this inducement force her not to love send her a story of thy noble acts tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence her uncle rivers yea and for her sake madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne <eos> king richard iii : come come you mock me this is not the way to win our daughter <eos> queen elizabeth : there is no other way unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be richard that hath done all this <eos> king richard iii : say that i did all this for love of her <eos> queen elizabeth : nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil <eos> king richard iii : look what is done cannot be now amended : men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes which after hours give leisure to repent <eos> if i did take the kingdom from your sons to make amends ill give it to your daughter <eos> if i have kill'd the issue of your womb to quicken your increase i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter a grandam's name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother they are as children but one step below even of your mettle of your very blood of an one pain save for a night of groans endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow <eos> your children were vexation to your youth but mine shall be a comfort to your age <eos> the loss you have is but a son being king and by that loss your daughter is made queen <eos> i cannot make you what amends i would therefore accept such kindness as i can <eos> dorset your son that with a fearful soul leads discontented steps in foreign soil this fair alliance quickly shall call home to high promotions and great dignity : the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife <eos> familiarly shall call thy dorset brother again shall you be mother to a king and all the ruins of distressful times repair'd with double riches of content <eos> what <eos> we have many goodly days to see : the liquid drops of tears that you have shed shall come again transform'd to orient pearl advantaging their loan with interest of ten times double gain of happiness <eos> go then my mother to thy daughter go make bold her bashful years with your experience prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale put in her tender heart the aspiring flame of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys and when this arm of mine hath chastised the petty rebel dull-brain'd buckingham bound with triumphant garlands will i come and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed to whom i will retail my conquest won and she shall be sole victress caesar's caesar <eos> queen elizabeth : what were i best to say <eos> her father's brother would be her lord <eos> or shall i say her uncle <eos> or he that slew her brothers and her uncles <eos> under what title shall i woo for thee that god the law my honour and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years <eos> king richard iii : infer fair england's peace by this alliance <eos> queen elizabeth : which she shall purchase with still lasting war <eos> king richard iii : say that the king which may command entreats <eos> queen elizabeth : that at her hands which the king's king forbids <eos> king richard iii : say she shall be a high and mighty queen <eos> queen elizabeth : to wail the tide as her mother doth <eos> king richard iii : say i will love her everlastingly <eos> queen elizabeth : but how long shall that title 'ever' last <eos> king richard iii : sweetly in force unto her fair life's end <eos> queen elizabeth : but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last <eos> king richard iii : so long as heaven and nature lengthens it <eos> queen elizabeth : so long as hell and richard likes of it <eos> king richard iii : say i her sovereign am her subject love <eos> queen elizabeth : but she your subject loathes such sovereignty <eos> king richard iii : be eloquent in my behalf to her <eos> queen elizabeth : an honest tale speeds best being plainly told <eos> king richard iii : then in plain terms tell her my loving tale <eos> queen elizabeth : plain and not honest is too harsh a style <eos> king richard iii : your reasons are too shallow and too quick <eos> queen elizabeth : o no my reasons are too deep and dead too deep and dead poor infants in their grave <eos> king richard iii : harp not on that string madam that is past <eos> queen elizabeth : harp on it still shall i till heart-strings break <eos> king richard iii : now by my george my garter and my crown <eos> queen elizabeth : profaned dishonour'd and the third usurp'd <eos> king richard iii : i swear <eos> queen elizabeth : by nothing for this is no oath : the george profaned hath lost his holy honour the garter blemish'd pawn'd his knightly virtue the crown usurp'd disgraced his kingly glory <eos> if something thou wilt swear to be believed swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd <eos> king richard iii : now by the world <eos> queen elizabeth : 'tis full of thy foul wrongs <eos> king richard iii : my father's death <eos> queen elizabeth : thy life hath that dishonour'd <eos> king richard iii : then by myself <eos> queen elizabeth : thyself thyself misusest <eos> king richard iii : why then by god <eos> queen elizabeth : god's wrong is most of all <eos> if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him the unity the king thy brother made had not been broken nor my brother slain : if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him the imperial metal circling now thy brow had graced the tender temples of my child and both the princes had been breathing here which now two tender playfellows to dust thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms <eos> what canst thou swear by now <eos> king richard iii : the time to come <eos> queen elizabeth : that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast for i myself have many tears to wash hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee <eos> the children live whose parents thou hast slaughter'd ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age the parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd old wither'd plants to wail it with their age <eos> swear not by time to come for that thou hast misused ere used by time misused o'erpast <eos> king richard iii : as i intend to prosper and repent so thrive i in my dangerous attempt of hostile arms <eos> myself myself confound <eos> heaven and fortune bar me happy hours <eos> day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest <eos> be opposite all planets of good luck to my proceedings if with pure heart's love immaculate devotion holy thoughts i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter <eos> in her consists my happiness and thine without her follows to this land and me to thee herself and many a christian soul death desolation ruin and decay : it cannot be avoided but by this it will not be avoided but by this <eos> therefore good mother <eos>i must can you so <eos> be the attorney of my love to her : plead what i will be not what i have been not my deserts but what i will deserve : urge the necessity and state of times and be not peevish-fond in great designs <eos> queen elizabeth : shall i be tempted of the devil thus <eos> king richard iii : ay if the devil tempt thee to do good <eos> queen elizabeth : shall i forget myself to be myself <eos> king richard iii : ay if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself <eos> queen elizabeth : but thou didst kill my children <eos> king richard iii : but in your daughter's womb i bury them : where in that nest of spicery they shall breed selves of themselves to your recomforture <eos> queen elizabeth : shall i go win my daughter to thy will <eos> king richard iii : and be a happy mother by the deed <eos> queen elizabeth : i go <eos> write to me very shortly <eos> and you shall understand from me her mind <eos> king richard iii : bear her my true love's kiss and so farewell <eos> relenting fool and shallow changing woman <eos> how now <eos> what news <eos> ratcliff : my gracious sovereign on the western coast rideth a puissant navy to the shore throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends unarm'd and unresolved to beat them back : 'tis thought that richmond is their admiral and there they hull expecting but the aid of buckingham to welcome them ashore <eos> king richard iii : some light-foot friend post to the duke of norfolk : ratcliff thyself or catesby where is he <eos> catesby : here my lord <eos> king richard iii : fly to the duke : post thou to salisbury when thou comest thither <eos> dull unmindful villain why stand'st thou

straight the greatest strength and power he can make and meet me presently at salisbury <eos> catesby : i go <eos> ratcliff : what is't your highness' pleasure i shall do at salisbury <eos> king

what news with you <eos> stanley : none good my lord to please you with the hearing nor none so bad but it may well be told <eos> king richard iii : hoyday a riddle <eos> neither good nor bad <eos> why dost thou run so many mile about when thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way <eos> once more what news <eos> stanley : richmond is on the seas <eos> king richard iii : there let him sink and be the seas on him <eos> white-liver'd runagate what doth he there <eos> stanley : i know not mighty sovereign but by guess <eos> king richard iii : well sir as you guess as you guess <eos> stanley : stirr'd up by dorset buckingham and ely he makes for england there to claim the crown <eos> king richard iii : is the chair empty <eos> is the sword unsway'd <eos> is the king dead <eos> the empire unpossess'd <eos> what heir of york is there alive but we <eos> and who is england's king but great york's heir <eos> then tell me what doth he upon the sea <eos> stanley : unless for that my liege i cannot guess <eos> king richard iii : unless for that he comes to be your liege you cannot guess wherefore the welshman comes <eos> thou wilt revolt and fly to him i fear <eos> stanley : no mighty liege therefore mistrust me not <eos> king richard iii : where is thy power then to beat him back <eos> where are thy tenants and thy followers <eos> are they not now upon the western shore <eos> safe-conducting the rebels from their ships <eos> stanley : no my good lord my friends are in the north <eos> king richard iii : cold friends to richard : what do they in the north when they should serve their sovereign in the west <eos> stanley : they have not been commanded mighty sovereign : please it your majesty to give me leave i'll muster up my friends and meet your grace where and what time your majesty shall please <eos> king richard iii : ay ay <eos> thou wouldst be gone to join with richmond : i will not trust you sir <eos> stanley : most mighty sovereign you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful : i never was nor never will be false <eos> king richard iii : well go muster men but hear you leave behind your son george stanley : look your faith be firm <eos> or else his head's assurance is but frail <eos> stanley : so deal with him as i prove true to you <eos> messenger : my gracious sovereign now in devonshire as i by friends am well advertised sir edward courtney and the haughty prelate bishop of exeter his brother there with many more confederates are in arms <eos> second messenger : my liege in kent the guildfords are in arms and every hour more competitors flock to their aid and still their power increaseth <eos> third messenger : my lord the army of the duke of buckingham <eos> king richard iii : out on you owls <eos> nothing but songs of death <eos> take that until thou bring me better news <eos> third messenger : the news i have to tell your majesty is that by sudden floods and fall of waters buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd and he himself wander'd away alone no man knows whither <eos> king richard iii : i cry thee mercy : there is my purse to cure that blow of thine <eos> hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd reward to him that brings the traitor in <eos> third messenger : such proclamation hath been made my liege <eos> fourth messenger : sir thomas lovel and lord marquis dorset 'tis said my liege in yorkshire are in arms <eos> yet this good comfort bring i to your grace the breton navy is dispersed by tempest : richmond in yorkshire sent out a boat unto the shore to ask those on the banks if they were his assistants yea or no who answer'd him they came from buckingham <eos> upon his party : he mistrusting them hoisted sail and made away for brittany <eos> king richard iii : march on march on since we are up in arms if not to fight with foreign enemies yet to beat down these rebels here at home <eos> catesby : my liege the duke of buckingham is taken that is the best news : that the earl of richmond is with a mighty power landed at milford is colder tidings yet they must be told <eos> king richard iii : away towards salisbury <eos> while we reason here a royal battle might be won and lost some one take order buckingham be brought to salisbury the rest march on with me <eos> derby : sir christopher tell richmond this from me : that in the sty of this most bloody boar my son george stanley is frank'd up in hold : if i revolt off goes young george's head the fear of that withholds my present aid <eos> but tell me where is princely richmond now <eos> christopher : at pembroke or at harford-west in wales <eos> derby : what men of name resort to him <eos> christopher : sir walter herbert a renowned soldier sir gilbert talbot sir william stanley oxford redoubted pembroke sir

<eos> this is all-souls' day fellows is it not <eos> sheriff : it is my lord <eos> buckingham : why then all-souls' day is my body's doomsday <eos> this is the day that in king edward's time i wish't might fall on me when i was found false to his children or his wife's allies this is the day wherein i wish'd to fall by the false faith of him i trusted most this this all-souls' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs : that high all-seer that i dallied with hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head and given in earnest what i begg'd in jest <eos> thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points on their masters' bosoms : now margaret's curse is fallen upon my head 'when he' quoth she 'shall split thy heart with sorrow remember margaret was a prophetess <eos>' come sirs convey me to the block of shame wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame <eos> richmond : fellows in arms and my most loving friends bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny thus far into the bowels of the land have we march'd on without impediment and here receive we from our father stanley lines of fair comfort and encouragement <eos> the wretched bloody and usurping boar that spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough in your embowell'd bosoms this foul swine lies now even in the centre of this isle near to the town of leicester as we learn from tamworth thither is but one day's march <eos> in god's name cheerly on courageous friends to reap the harvest of perpetual peace by this one bloody trial of sharp war <eos> oxford : every man's conscience is a thousand swords to fight against that bloody homicide <eos> herbert : i doubt not but his friends will fly to us <eos> blunt : he hath no friends but who are friends for fear <eos> which in his greatest need will shrink from him <eos> richmond : all for our vantage <eos> then in god's name march : true hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings : kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings <eos> king richard iii : here pitch our tents even here in bosworth field <eos> my lord of surrey why look you so sad <eos> surrey : my heart is ten times lighter than my looks <eos> king richard iii : my lord of norfolk <eos> norfolk : here most gracious liege <eos> king richard iii : norfolk we must have knocks ha <eos> must we not <eos> norfolk : we must both give and take my gracious lord <eos> king richard iii : up with my tent there <eos> here will i lie tonight but where to-morrow <eos> well all's one for that <eos> who hath descried the number of the foe <eos> norfolk : six or seven thousand is their utmost power <eos> king richard iii : why our battalion trebles that account : besides the king's name is a tower of strength which they upon the adverse party want <eos> up with my tent there <eos> valiant gentlemen let us survey the vantage of the field call for some men of sound direction let's want no discipline make no delay for lords to-morrow is a busy day <eos> richmond : the weary sun hath made a golden set and by the bright track of his fiery car gives signal of a goodly day to-morrow <eos> sir william brandon you shall bear my standard <eos> give me some ink and paper in my tent i'll draw the form and model of our battle limit each leader to his several charge and part in just proportion our small strength <eos> my lord of oxford you sir william brandon and you sir walter herbert stay with me <eos> the earl of pembroke keeps his regiment : good captain blunt bear my good night to him and by the second hour in the morning desire the earl to see me in my tent : yet one thing more good blunt before thou go'st where is lord stanley quarter'd dost thou know <eos> blunt : unless i have mista'en his colours much which well i am assured i have not done his regiment lies half a mile at least south from the mighty power of the king <eos> richmond : if without peril it be possible good captain blunt bear my good-night to him and give him from me this most needful scroll <eos> blunt : upon my life my lord i'll under-take it and so god give you quiet rest to-night <eos> richmond : good night good captain blunt <eos> come gentlemen let us consult upon to-morrow's business in to our tent the air is raw and cold <eos> king richard iii : what is't o'clock <eos> catesby : it's supper-time my lord it's nine o'clock <eos> king richard iii : i will not sup to-night <eos> give me some ink and paper <eos> what is my beaver easier than it was <eos> and all my armour laid into my tent <eos> catesby : if is my liege and all things are in readiness <eos> king richard iii : good norfolk hie thee to thy charge use careful watch choose trusty sentinels <eos> norfolk : i go my lord <eos> king richard iii : stir with the lark to-morrow gentle norfolk <eos> norfolk : i warrant you my lord <eos> king richard iii : catesby <eos> catesby : my lord <eos> king richard iii : send out a pursuivant at arms to stanley's regiment bid him bring his power before sunrising lest his son george fall into the blind cave of eternal night <eos> fill me a bowl of wine <eos> give me a watch <eos> saddle white surrey for the field to-morrow <eos> look that my staves be sound and not too heavy <eos> ratcliff <eos> ratcliff : my lord <eos> king richard iii : saw'st thou the melancholy lord northumberland <eos> ratcliff : thomas the earl of surrey and himself much about cock-shut time from troop to troop went through the army cheering up the soldiers <eos> king richard iii : so i am satisfied <eos> give me a bowl of wine : i have not that alacrity of spirit nor cheer of mind that i was wont to have <eos> set it down <eos> is ink and paper ready <eos> ratcliff : it is my lord <eos> king richard iii : bid my guard watch leave me <eos> ratcliff about the mid of night come to my tent and help to arm me <eos> leave me i say <eos> derby : fortune and victory sit on thy helm <eos> richmond : all comfort that the dark night can afford be to thy person noble father-in-law <eos> tell me how fares our loving mother <eos> derby : i by attorney bless thee from thy mother who prays continually for richmond's good : so much for that <eos> the silent hours steal on and flaky darkness breaks within the east <eos> in brief <eos>for so the season bids us be <eos> prepare thy battle early in the morning and put thy fortune to the arbitrement of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war <eos> i as i may <eos>that which i would i cannot <eos> with best advantage will deceive the time and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms : but on thy side i may not be too forward lest being seen thy brother tender george be executed in his father's sight <eos> farewell : the leisure and the fearful time cuts off the ceremonious vows of love and ample interchange of sweet discourse which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon : god give us leisure for these rites of love <eos> once more adieu : be valiant and speed well <eos> richmond : good lords conduct him to his regiment : i'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow when i should mount with wings of victory : once more good night kind lords and gentlemen <eos> o thou whose captain i account myself look on my forces with a gracious eye put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath that they may crush down with a heavy fall the usurping helmets of our adversaries <eos> make us thy ministers of chastisement that we may praise thee in the victory <eos> to thee i do commend my watchful soul ere i let fall the windows of mine eyes : sleeping and waking o defend me still <eos> ghost of prince edward : ghost of king henry vi : ghost of clarence : ghost of rivers : ghost of grey : ghost of vaughan : all : ghost of hastings : ghosts of young princes : ghost of lady anne : ghost of buckingham : king richard iii : give me another horse : bind up my wounds <eos> have mercy jesu <eos> <eos>soft <eos> i did but dream <eos> o coward conscience how dost thou afflict me <eos> the lights burn blue <eos> it is now dead midnight <eos> cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh <eos> what do i fear <eos> myself <eos> there's none else by : richard loves richard that is i am i <eos> is there a murderer here <eos> no <eos> yes i am : then fly <eos> what from myself <eos> great reason why : lest i revenge <eos> what myself upon myself <eos> alack <eos> i love myself <eos> wherefore <eos> for any good that i myself have done unto myself <eos> o no <eos> alas i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself <eos> i am a villain : yet i lie <eos> i am not <eos> fool of thyself speak well : fool do not flatter <eos> my conscience hath a thousand several tongues and every tongue brings in a several tale and every tale condemns me for a villain <eos> perjury perjury in the high'st degree murder stem murder in the direst degree all several sins all used in each degree throng to the bar crying all guilty <eos> guilty <eos> i shall despair <eos> there is no creature loves me and if i die no soul shall pity me : nay wherefore should they since that i myself find in myself no pity to myself <eos> methought the souls of all that i had murder'd came to my tent and every one did threat to-morrow's vengeance on the head of richard <eos> ratcliff : my lord <eos> king richard iii : 'zounds <eos> who is there <eos> ratcliff : ratcliff my lord 'tis i <eos> the early village-cock hath twice done salutation to the morn your friends are up and buckle on their armour <eos> king richard iii : o ratcliff i have dream'd a fearful dream <eos> what thinkest thou will our friends prove all true <eos> ratcliff : no doubt my lord <eos> king richard iii : o ratcliff i fear i fear <eos> ratcliff : nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows <eos> king richard iii : by the apostle paul shadows to-night have struck more terror to the soul of richard than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers armed in proof and led by shallow richmond <eos> it is not yet near day <eos> come go with me under our tents i'll play the eaves-dropper to see if any mean to shrink from me <eos> lords : good morrow richmond <eos> richmond : cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here <eos> lords : how have you slept my lord <eos> richmond : the sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams that ever enter'd in a drowsy head have i since your departure had my lords <eos> methought their souls whose bodies richard murder'd came to my tent and cried on victory : i promise you my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream <eos> how far into the morning is it lords <eos> lords : upon the stroke of four <eos> richmond : why then 'tis time to arm and give direction <eos> more than i have said loving countrymen the leisure and enforcement of the time forbids to dwell upon : yet remember this god and our good cause fight upon our side the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls like high-rear'd bulwarks stand before our faces richard except those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow : for what is he they follow <eos> truly gentlemen a bloody tyrant and a homicide one raised in blood and one in blood establish'd one that made means to come by what he hath and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him abase foul stone made precious by the foil of england's chair where he is falsely set one that hath ever been god's enemy : then if you fight against god's enemy god will in justice ward you as his soldiers if you do sweat to put a tyrant down you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain if you do fight against your country's foes your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire if you do fight in safeguard of your wives your wives shall welcome home the conquerors if you do free your children from the sword your children's children quit it in your age <eos> then in the name of god and all these rights advance your standards draw your willing swords <eos> for me the ransom of my bold attempt shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face but if i thrive the gain of my attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof <eos> sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully god and saint george <eos> richmond and victory <eos> king richard iii : what said northumberland as touching richmond <eos> ratcliff : that he was never trained up in arms <eos> king richard iii : he said the truth : and what said surrey then <eos> ratcliff : he smiled and said 'the better for our purpose <eos>' king richard iii : he was in the right and so indeed it is <eos> ten the clock there <eos> give me a calendar <eos> who saw the sun to-day <eos> ratcliff : not i my lord <eos> king richard iii : then he disdains to shine for by the book he should have braved the east an hour ago a black day will it be to somebody <eos> ratcliff <eos> ratcliff : my lord <eos> king richard iii : the sun will not be seen to-day the sky doth frown and lour upon our army <eos> i would these dewy tears were from the ground <eos> not shine to-day <eos> why what is that to me more than to richmond <eos> for the selfsame heaven that frowns on me looks sadly upon him <eos> norfolk : arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field <eos> king richard iii : come bustle bustle caparison my horse <eos> call up lord stanley bid him bring his power : i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain and thus my battle shall be ordered : my foreward shall be drawn out all in length consisting equally of horse and foot our archers shall be placed in the midst john duke of norfolk thomas earl of surrey shall have the leading of this foot and horse <eos> they thus directed we will follow in the main battle whose puissance on either side shall be well winged with our chiefest horse <eos> this and saint george to boot <eos> what think'st thou norfolk <eos> norfolk : a good direction warlike sovereign <eos> this found i on my tent this morning <eos> king richard iii : messenger : my lord he doth deny to come <eos> king richard iii : off with his son george's head <eos> norfolk : my lord the enemy is past the marsh after the battle let george stanley die <eos> king richard iii : a thousand hearts are great within my bosom : advance our standards set upon our foes our ancient word of courage fair saint george inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons <eos> upon them <eos> victory sits on our helms <eos> catesby : rescue my lord of norfolk rescue rescue <eos> the king enacts more wonders than a man daring an opposite to every danger : his horse is slain and all on foot he fights seeking for richmond in the throat of death <eos> rescue fair lord or else the day is lost <eos> king richard iii : a horse <eos> a horse <eos> my kingdom for a horse <eos> catesby : withdraw my lord i'll help you to a horse <eos> king richard iii : slave i have set my life upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the die : i think there be six richmonds in the field five have i slain to-day instead of him <eos> a horse <eos> a horse <eos> my kingdom for a horse <eos> richmond : god and your arms be praised victorious friends the day is ours the bloody dog is dead <eos> derby : courageous richmond well hast thou acquit thee <eos> lo here this long-usurped royalty from the dead temples of this bloody wretch have i pluck'd off to grace thy brows withal : wear it enjoy it and make much of it <eos> richmond : great god of heaven say amen to all <eos> but tell me is young george stanley living <eos> derby : he is my lord and safe in leicester town whither if it please you we may now withdraw us <eos> richmond : what men of name are slain on either side <eos> derby : john duke of norfolk walter lord ferrers sir robert brakenbury and sir william brandon <eos> richmond : inter their bodies as becomes their births : proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled that in submission will return to us : and then as we have ta'en the sacrament we will unite the white rose and the red : smile heaven upon this fair conjunction that long have frown'd upon their enmity <eos> what traitor hears me and says not amen <eos> england hath long been mad and scarr'd herself the brother blindly shed the brother's blood the father rashly slaughter'd his own son the son compell'd been butcher to the sire : all this divided york and lancaster divided in their dire division o now let richmond and elizabeth the true succeeders of each royal house by god's fair ordinance conjoin together <eos> and let their heirs god if thy will be so <eos> enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days <eos> abate the edge of traitors gracious lord that would reduce these bloody days again and make poor england weep in streams of blood <eos> let them not live to taste this land's increase that would with treason wound this fair land's peace <eos> now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again : that she may long live here god say amen <eos> king richard ii : old john of gaunt time-honour'd lancaster hast thou according to thy oath and band brought hither henry hereford thy bold son here to make good the boisterous late appeal which then our leisure would not let us hear against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray <eos> john of gaunt : i have my liege <eos> king richard ii : tell me moreover hast thou sounded him if he appeal the duke on ancient malice or worthily as a good subject should on some known ground of treachery in him <eos> john of gaunt : as near as i could sift him on that argument on some apparent danger seen in him aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice <eos> king richard ii : then call them to our presence face to face and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear the accuser and the accused freely speak : high-stomach'd are they both and full of ire in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire <eos> henry bolingbroke : many years of happy days befal my gracious sovereign my most loving liege <eos> thomas mowbray : each day still better other's happiness until the heavens envying earth's good hap add an immortal title to your crown <eos> king richard ii : we thank you both : yet one but flatters us as well appeareth by the cause you come namely to appeal each other of high treason <eos> cousin of hereford what dost thou object against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray <eos> henry bolingbroke : first heaven be the record to my speech <eos> in the devotion of a subject's love tendering the precious safety of my prince and free from other misbegotten hate come i appellant to this princely presence <eos> now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee and mark my greeting well for what i speak my body shall make good upon this earth or my divine soul answer it in heaven <eos> thou art a traitor and a miscreant too good to be so and too bad to live since the more fair and crystal is the sky the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly <eos> once more the more to aggravate the note with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat and wish so please my sovereign ere i move what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove <eos> thomas mowbray : let not my cold words here accuse my zeal : 'tis not the trial of a woman's war the bitter clamour of two eager tongues can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this : yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be hush'd and nought at all to say : first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and spurs to my free speech which else would post until it had return'd these terms of treason doubled down his throat <eos> setting aside his high blood's royalty and let him be no kinsman to my liege i do defy him and i spit at him call him a slanderous coward and a villain : which to maintain i would allow him odds and meet him were i tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the alps or any other ground inhabitable where ever englishman durst set his foot <eos> mean time let this defend my loyalty by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie <eos> henry bolingbroke : pale trembling coward there i throw my gage disclaiming here the kindred of the king and lay aside my high blood's royalty which fear not reverence makes thee to except <eos> if guilty dread have left thee so much strength as to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop : by that and all the rites of knighthood else will i make good against thee arm to arm what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise <eos> thomas mowbray : i take it up and by that sword i swear which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder i'll answer thee in any fair degree or chivalrous design of knightly trial : and when i mount alive may i not light if i be traitor or unjustly fight <eos> king richard ii : what doth our cousin lay to mowbray's charge <eos> it must be great that can inherit us so much as of a thought of ill in him <eos> henry bolingbroke : look what i speak my life shall prove it true that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness' soldiers the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain <eos> besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was survey'd by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring <eos> further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death suggest his soon-believing adversaries and consequently like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood : which blood like sacrificing abel's cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth to me for justice and rough chastisement and by the glorious worth of my descent this arm shall do it or this life be spent <eos> king richard ii : how high a pitch his resolution soars <eos> thomas of norfolk what say'st thou to this <eos> thomas mowbray : o let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf till i have told this slander of his blood how god and good men hate so foul a liar <eos> king richard ii : mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears : were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir as he is but my father's brother's son now by my sceptre's awe i make a vow such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood should nothing privilege him nor partialize the unstooping firmness of my upright soul : he is our subject mowbray so art thou : free speech and fearless i to thee allow <eos> thomas mowbray : then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart through the false passage of thy throat thou liest <eos> three parts of that receipt i had for calais disbursed i duly to his highness' soldiers the other part reserved i by consent for that my sovereign liege was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account since last i went to france to fetch his queen : now swallow down that lie <eos> for gloucester's death i slew him not but to my own disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case <eos> for you my noble lord of lancaster the honourable father to my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it and exactly begg'd your grace's pardon and i hope i had it <eos> this is my fault : as for the rest appeall'd it issues from the rancour of a villain a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitor's foot to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom <eos> in haste whereof most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day <eos> king richard ii : wrath-kindled gentlemen be ruled by me let's purge this choler without letting blood : this we prescribe though no physician deep malice makes too deep incision forget forgive conclude and be agreed our doctors say this is no month to bleed <eos> good uncle let this end where it begun we'll calm the duke of norfolk you your son <eos> john of gaunt : to be a make-peace shall become my age : throw down my son the duke of norfolk's gage <eos> king richard ii : and norfolk throw down his <eos> john of gaunt : when harry when <eos> obedience bids i should not bid again <eos> king richard ii : norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot <eos> thomas mowbray : myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot <eos> my life thou shalt command but not my shame : the one my duty owes but my fair name despite of death that lives upon my grave to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have <eos> i am disgraced impeach'd and baffled here pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear the which no balm can cure but his heart-blood which breathed this poison <eos> king richard ii : rage must be withstood : give me his gage : lions make leopards tame <eos> thomas mowbray : yea but not change his spots : take but my shame <eos> and i resign my gage <eos> my dear dear lord the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation : that away men are but gilded loam or painted clay <eos> a jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast <eos> mine honour is my life both grow in one : take honour from me and my life is done : then dear my liege mine honour let me try in that i live and for that will i die <eos> king richard ii : cousin throw up your gage do you begin <eos> henry bolingbroke : o god defend my soul from such deep sin <eos> shall i seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight <eos> or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height before this out-dared dastard <eos> ere my tongue shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear the slavish motive of recanting fear and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace where shame doth harbour even in mowbray's face <eos> king richard ii : we were not born to sue but to command which since we cannot do to make you friends be ready as your lives shall answer it at coventry upon saint lambert's day : there shall your swords and lances arbitrate the swelling difference of your settled hate : since we can not atone you we shall see justice design the victor's chivalry <eos> lord marshal command our officers at arms be ready to direct these home alarms <eos> john of gaunt : alas the part i had in woodstock's blood doth more solicit me than your exclaims to stir against the butchers of his life <eos> but since correction lieth in those hands which made the fault that we cannot correct put we our quarrel to the will of heaven who when they see the hours ripe on earth will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads <eos> duchess : finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur <eos> hath love in thy old blood no living fire <eos> edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one were as seven vials of his sacred blood or seven fair branches springing from one root : some of those seven are dried by nature's course some of those branches by the destinies cut but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester one vial full of edward's sacred blood one flourishing branch of his most royal root is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe <eos> ah gaunt his blood was thine <eos> that bed that womb that metal that self-mould that fashion'd thee made him a man and though thou livest and breathest yet art thou slain in him : thou dost consent in some large measure to thy father's death in that thou seest thy wretched brother die who was the model of thy father's life <eos> call it not patience gaunt it is despair : in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd thou showest the naked pathway to thy life teaching stern murder how to butcher thee : that which in mean men we intitle patience is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts <eos> what shall i say <eos> to safeguard thine own life the best way is to venge my gloucester's death <eos> john of gaunt : god's is the quarrel for god's substitute his deputy anointed in his sight hath caused his death : the which if wrongfully let heaven revenge for i may never lift an angry arm against his minister <eos> duchess : where then alas may i complain myself <eos> john of gaunt : to god the widow's champion and defence <eos> duchess : why then i will <eos> farewell old gaunt <eos> thou goest to coventry there to behold our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight : o sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear that it may enter butcher mowbray's breast <eos> or if misfortune miss the first career be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom they may break his foaming courser's back and throw the rider headlong in the lists a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford <eos> farewell old gaunt : thy sometimes brother's wife with her companion grief must end her life <eos> john of gaunt : sister farewell i must to coventry : as much good stay with thee as go with me <eos> duchess : yet one word more : grief boundeth where it falls not with the empty hollowness but weight : i take my leave before i have begun for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done <eos> commend me to thy brother edmund york <eos> lo this is all : <eos>nay yet depart not so though this be all do not so quickly go i shall remember more <eos> bid him <eos>ah what <eos> <eos> with all good speed at plashy visit me <eos> alack and what shall good old york there see but empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls unpeopled offices untrodden stones <eos> and what hear there for welcome but my groans <eos> therefore commend me let him not come there to seek out sorrow that dwells every where <eos> desolate desolate will i hence and die : the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye <eos> lord marshal : my lord aumerle is harry hereford arm'd <eos> duke of aumerle : yea at all points and longs to enter in <eos> lord marshal : the duke of norfolk sprightfully and bold stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet <eos> duke of aumerle : why then the champions are prepared and stay for nothing but his majesty's approach <eos> king richard ii : marshal demand of yonder champion the cause of his arrival here in arms : ask him his name and orderly proceed to swear him in the justice of his cause <eos> lord marshal : in god's name and the king's say who thou art and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms against what man thou comest and what thy quarrel : speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath as so defend thee heaven and thy valour <eos> thomas mowbray : my name is thomas mowbray duke of norfolk who hither come engaged by my oath <eos> which god defend a knight should violate <eos> <eos> both to defend my loyalty and truth to god my king and my succeeding issue against the duke of hereford that appeals me and by the grace of god and this mine arm to prove him in defending of myself a traitor to my god my king and me : and as i truly fight defend me heaven <eos> king richard ii : marshal ask yonder knight in arms both who he is and why he cometh hither thus plated in habiliments of war and formally according to our law depose him in the justice of his cause <eos> lord marshal : what is thy name <eos> and wherefore comest thou hither before king richard in his royal lists <eos> against whom comest thou <eos> and what's thy quarrel <eos> speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven <eos> henry bolingbroke : harry of hereford lancaster and derby am i who ready here do stand in arms to prove by god's grace and my body's valour in lists on thomas mowbray duke of norfolk that he is a traitor foul and dangerous to god of heaven king richard and to me and as i truly fight defend me heaven <eos> lord marshal : on pain of death no person be so bold or daring-hardy as to touch the lists except the marshal and such officers appointed to direct these fair designs <eos> henry bolingbroke : lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign's hand and bow my knee before his majesty : for mowbray and myself are like two men that vow a long and weary pilgrimage then let us take a ceremonious leave and loving farewell of our several friends <eos> lord marshal : the appellant in all duty greets your highness and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave <eos> king richard ii : we will descend and fold him in our arms <eos> cousin of hereford as thy cause is right so be thy fortune in this royal fight <eos> farewell my blood which if to-day thou shed lament we may but not revenge thee dead <eos> henry bolingbroke : o let no noble eye profane a tear for me if i be gored with mowbray's spear : as confident as is the falcon's flight against a bird do i with mowbray fight <eos> my loving lord i take my leave of you of you my noble cousin lord aumerle not sick although i have to do with death but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath <eos> lo as at english feasts so i regreet the daintiest last to make the end most sweet : o thou the earthly author of my blood whose youthful spirit in me regenerate doth with a twofold vigour lift me up to reach at victory above my head add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers and with thy blessings steel my lance's point that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat and furbish new the name of john a gaunt even in the lusty havior of his son <eos> john of gaunt : god in thy good cause make thee prosperous <eos> be swift like lightning in the execution and let thy blows doubly redoubled fall like amazing thunder on the casque of thy adverse pernicious enemy : rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live <eos> henry bolingbroke : mine innocency and saint george to thrive <eos> thomas mowbray : however god or fortune cast my lot there lives or dies true to king richard's throne a loyal just and upright gentleman : never did captive with a freer heart cast off his chains of bondage and embrace his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement more than my dancing soul doth celebrate this feast of battle with mine adversary <eos> most mighty liege and my companion peers take from my mouth the wish of happy years : as gentle and as jocund as to jest go i to fight : truth hath a quiet breast <eos> king richard ii : farewell my lord : securely i espy virtue with valour couched in thine eye <eos> order the trial marshal and begin <eos> lord marshal : harry of hereford lancaster and derby receive thy lance and god defend the right <eos> henry bolingbroke : strong as a tower in hope i cry amen <eos> lord marshal : go bear this lance to thomas duke of norfolk <eos> first herald : harry of hereford lancaster and derby stands here for god his sovereign and himself on pain to be found false and recreant to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray a traitor to his god his king and him and dares him to set forward to the fight <eos> second herald : here standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk on pain to be found false and recreant both to defend himself and to approve henry of hereford lancaster and derby to god his sovereign and to him disloyal courageously and with a free desire attending but the signal to begin <eos> lord marshal : sound trumpets and set forward combatants <eos> stay the king hath thrown his warder down <eos> king richard ii : let them lay by their helmets and their spears and both return back to their chairs again : withdraw with us : and let the trumpets sound while we return these dukes what we decree <eos> draw near and list what with our council we have done <eos> for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd with that dear blood which it hath fostered and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword and for we think the eagle-winged pride of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts with rival-hating envy set on you to wake our peace which in our country's cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums with harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray and grating shock of wrathful iron arms might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindred's blood therefore we banish you our territories : you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions but tread the stranger paths of banishment <eos> henry bolingbroke : your will be done : this must my comfort be sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment <eos> king richard ii : norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom which i with some unwillingness pronounce : the sly slow hours shall not determinate the dateless limit of thy dear exile the hopeless word of 'never to return' breathe i against thee upon pain of life <eos> thomas mowbray : a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth : a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deserved at your highness' hands <eos> the language i have learn'd these forty years my native english now i must forego : and now my tongue's use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony : within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me <eos> i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now : what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath <eos> king richard ii : it boots thee not to be compassionate : after our sentence plaining comes too late <eos> thomas mowbray : then thus i turn me from my country's light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night <eos> king richard ii : return again and take an oath with thee <eos> lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands swear by the duty that you owe to god <eos> our part therein we banish with yourselves <eos> to keep the oath that we administer : you never shall so help you truth and god <eos> embrace each other's love in banishment nor never look upon each other's face nor never write regreet nor reconcile this louring tempest of your home-bred hate nor never by advised purpose meet to plot contrive or complot any ill 'gainst us our state our subjects or our land <eos> henry bolingbroke : i swear <eos> thomas mowbray : and i to keep all this <eos> henry bolingbroke : norfolk so far as to mine enemy : <eos> by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wander'd in the air <eos> banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banish'd from this land : confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burthen of a guilty soul <eos> thomas mowbray : no bolingbroke : if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banish'd as from hence <eos> but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue <eos> farewell my liege <eos> now no way can i stray save back to england all the world's my way <eos> king richard ii : uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart : thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banish'd years pluck'd four away <eos> six frozen winter spent return with welcome home from banishment <eos> henry bolingbroke : how long a time lies in one little word <eos> four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word : such is the breath of kings <eos> john of gaunt : i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my son's exile : but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son <eos> king richard ii : why uncle thou hast many years to live <eos> john of gaunt : but not a minute king that thou canst give : shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou canst help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath <eos> king richard ii : thy son is banish'd upon good advice whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave : why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour <eos> john of gaunt : things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour <eos> you urged me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father <eos> o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild : a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroy'd <eos> alas i look'd when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong <eos> king richard ii : cousin farewell and uncle bid him so : six years we banish him and he shall go <eos> duke of aumerle : cousin farewell : what presence must not know from where you do remain let paper show <eos> lord marshal : my lord no leave take i for i will ride as far as land will let me by your side <eos> john of gaunt : o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends <eos> henry bolingbroke : i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongue's office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart <eos> john of gaunt : thy grief is but thy absence for a time <eos> henry bolingbroke : joy absent grief is present for that time <eos> john of gaunt : what is six winters <eos> they are quickly gone <eos> henry bolingbroke : to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten <eos> john of gaunt : call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure <eos> henry bolingbroke : my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an inforced pilgrimage <eos> john of gaunt : the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return <eos> henry bolingbroke : nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love <eos> must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief <eos> john of gaunt : all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens <eos> teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity <eos> think not the king did banish thee but thou the king <eos> woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne <eos> go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime : look what thy soul holds dear imagine it to lie that way thou go'st not whence thou comest : suppose the singing birds musicians the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light <eos> henry bolingbroke : o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus <eos> or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast <eos> or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summer's heat <eos> o no <eos> the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse : fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites but lanceth not the sore <eos> john of gaunt : come come my son i'll bring thee on thy way : had i thy youth and cause i would not stay <eos> henry bolingbroke : then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu my mother and my nurse that bears me yet <eos> where'er i wander boast of this i can though banish'd yet a trueborn englishman <eos> king richard ii : we did observe <eos> cousin aumerle how far brought you high hereford on his way <eos> duke of aumerle : i brought high hereford if you call him so but to the next highway and there i left him <eos> king richard ii : and say what store of parting tears were shed <eos> duke of aumerle : faith none for me except the north-east wind which then blew bitterly against our faces awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear <eos> king richard ii : what said our cousin when you parted with him <eos> duke of aumerle : 'farewell :' and for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane the word that taught me craft to counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave <eos> marry would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours and added years to his short banishment he should have had a volume of farewells but since it would not he had none of me <eos> king richard ii : he is our cousin cousin but 'tis doubt when time shall call him home from banishment whether our kinsman come to see his friends <eos> ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune as 'twere to banish their affects with him <eos> off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the tribute of his supple knee with 'thanks my countrymen my loving friends' as were our england in reversion his and he our subjects' next degree in hope <eos> green : well he is gone and with him go these thoughts <eos> now for the rebels which stand out in ireland expedient manage must be made my liege ere further leisure yield them further means for their advantage and your highness' loss <eos> king richard ii : we will ourself in person to this war : and for our coffers with too great a court and liberal largess are grown somewhat light we are inforced to farm our royal realm the revenue whereof shall furnish us for our affairs in hand : if that come short our substitutes at home shall have blank charters whereto when they shall know what men are rich they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold and send them after to supply our wants for we will make for ireland presently <eos> bushy what news <eos> bushy : old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord suddenly taken and hath sent post haste to entreat your majesty to visit him <eos> king richard ii : where lies he <eos> bushy : at ely house <eos> king richard ii : now put it god in the physician's mind to help him to his grave immediately <eos> the lining of his coffers shall make coats to deck our soldiers for these irish wars <eos> come gentlemen let's all go visit him : pray god we may make haste and come too late <eos> all : amen <eos> john of gaunt : will the king come that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth <eos> duke of york : vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath for all in vain comes counsel to his ear <eos> john of gaunt : o but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony : where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain <eos> he that no more must say is listen'd more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose more are men's ends mark'd than their lives before : the setting sun and music at the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than things long past : though richard my life's counsel would not hear my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear <eos> duke of york : no it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds as praises of whose taste the wise are fond lascivious metres to whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation <eos> where doth the world thrust forth a vanity <eos> so it be new there's no respect how vile <eos> that is not quickly buzzed into his ears <eos> then all too late comes counsel to be heard where will doth mutiny with wit's regard <eos> direct not him whose way himself will choose : 'tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose <eos> john of gaunt : methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him : his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last for violent fires soon burn out themselves small showers last long but sudden storms are short he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder : light vanity insatiate cormorant consuming means soon preys upon itself <eos> this royal throne of kings this scepter'd isle this earth of majesty this seat of mars this other eden demi-paradise this fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war this happy breed of men this little world this precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happier lands this blessed plot this earth this realm this england this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth renowned for their deeds as far from home for christian service and true chivalry as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry of the world's ransom blessed mary's son this land of such dear souls this dear dear land dear for her reputation through the world is now leased out i die pronouncing it like to a tenement or pelting farm : england bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of watery neptune is now bound in with shame with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds : that england that was wont to conquer others hath made a shameful conquest of itself <eos> ah would the scandal vanish with my life how happy then were my ensuing death <eos> duke of york : the king is come : deal mildly with his youth for young hot colts being raged do rage the more <eos> queen : how fares our noble uncle lancaster <eos> king richard ii : what comfort man <eos> how is't with aged gaunt <eos> john of gaunt : o how that name befits my composition <eos> old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old : within me grief hath kept a tedious fast and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt <eos> for sleeping england long time have i watch'd watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt : the pleasure that some fathers feed upon is my strict fast i mean my children's looks and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt : gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones <eos> king richard ii : can sick men play so nicely with their names <eos> john of gaunt : no misery makes sport to mock itself : since thou dost seek to kill my name in me i mock my name great king to flatter thee <eos> king richard ii : should dying men flatter with those that live <eos> john of gaunt : no no men living flatter those that die <eos> king richard ii : thou now a-dying say'st thou flatterest me <eos> john of gaunt : o no <eos> thou diest though i the sicker be <eos> king richard ii : i am in health i breathe and see thee ill <eos> john of gaunt : now he that made me knows i see thee ill ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill <eos> thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land wherein thou liest in reputation sick and thou too careless patient as thou art commit'st thy anointed body to the cure of those physicians that first wounded thee : a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown whose compass is no bigger than thy head and yet incaged in so small a verge the waste is no whit lesser than thy land <eos> o had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye seen how his son's son should destroy his sons from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame deposing thee before thou wert possess'd which art possess'd now to depose thyself <eos> why cousin wert thou regent of the world it were a shame to let this land by lease but for thy world enjoying but this land is it not more than shame to shame it so <eos> landlord of england art thou now not king : thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou <eos> king richard ii : a lunatic lean-witted fool presuming on an ague's privilege darest with thy frozen admonition make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood with fury from his native residence <eos> now by my seat's right royal majesty wert thou not brother to great edward's son this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders <eos> john of gaunt : o spare me not my brother edward's son for that i was his father edward's son that blood already like the pelican hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused : my brother gloucester plain well-meaning soul whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls <eos> may be a precedent and witness good that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood : join with the present sickness that i have and thy unkindness be like crooked age to crop at once a too long wither'd flower <eos> live in thy shame but die not shame with thee <eos> these words hereafter thy tormentors be <eos> convey me to my bed then to my grave : love they to live that love and honour have <eos> king richard ii : and let them die that age and sullens have for both hast thou and both become the grave <eos> duke of york : i do beseech your majesty impute his words to wayward sickliness and age in him : he loves you on my life and holds you dear as harry duke of hereford were he here <eos> king richard ii : right you say true : as hereford's love so his as theirs so mine and all be as it is <eos> northumberland : my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty <eos> king richard ii : what says he <eos> northumberland : nay nothing all is said his tongue is now a stringless instrument words life and all old lancaster hath spent <eos> duke of york : be york the next that must be bankrupt so <eos> though death be poor it ends a mortal woe <eos> king richard ii : the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he his time is spent our pilgrimage must be <eos> so much for that <eos> now for our irish wars : we must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns which live like venom where no venom else but only they have privilege to live <eos> and for these great affairs do ask some charge towards our assistance we do seize to us the plate corn revenues and moveables whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd <eos> duke of york : how long shall i be patient <eos> ah how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong <eos> not gloucester's death nor hereford's banishment not gaunt's rebukes nor england's private wrongs nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke about his marriage nor my own disgrace have ever made me sour my patient cheek or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face <eos> i am the last of noble edward's sons of whom thy father prince of wales was first : in war was never lion raged more fierce in peace was never gentle lamb more mild than was that young and princely gentleman <eos> his face thou hast for even so look'd he accomplish'd with the number of thy hours but when he frown'd it was against the french and not against his friends his noble hand did will what he did spend and spent not that which his triumphant father's hand had won his hands were guilty of no kindred blood but bloody with the enemies of his kin <eos> o richard <eos> york is too far gone with grief or else he never would compare between <eos> king richard ii : why uncle what's the matter <eos> duke of york : o my liege pardon me if you please if not i pleased not to be pardon'd am content withal <eos> seek you to seize and gripe into your hands the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford <eos> is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live <eos> was not gaunt just and is not harry true <eos> did not the one deserve to have an heir <eos> is not his heir a well-deserving son <eos> take hereford's rights away and take from time his charters and his customary rights let not to-morrow then ensue to-day be not thyself for how art thou a king but by fair sequence and succession <eos> now afore god <eos>god forbid i say true <eos> <eos> if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights call in the letters patent that he hath by his attorneys-general to sue his livery and deny his offer'd homage you pluck a thousand dangers on your head you lose a thousand well-disposed hearts and prick my tender patience to those thoughts which honour and allegiance cannot think <eos> king richard ii : think what you will we seize into our hands his plate his goods his money and his lands <eos> duke of york : i'll not be by the while : my liege farewell : what will ensue hereof there's none can tell but by bad courses may be understood that their events can never fall out good <eos> king richard ii : go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight : bid him repair to us to ely house to see this business <eos> to-morrow next we will for ireland and 'tis time i trow : and we create in absence of ourself our uncle york lord governor of england for he is just and always loved us well <eos> come on our queen : to-morrow must we part be merry for our time of stay is short northumberland : well lords the duke of lancaster is dead <eos> lord ross : and living too for now his son is duke <eos> lord willoughby : barely in title not in revenue <eos> northumberland : richly in both if justice had her right <eos> lord ross : my heart is great but it must break with silence ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue <eos> northumberland : nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more that speaks thy words again to do thee harm <eos> lord willoughby : tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford <eos> if it be so out with it boldly man quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him <eos> lord ross : no good at all that i can do for him unless you call it good to pity him bereft and gelded of his patrimony <eos> northumberland : now afore god 'tis shame such wrongs are borne in him a royal prince and many moe of noble blood in this declining land <eos> the king is not himself but basely led by flatterers and what they will inform merely in hate 'gainst any of us all that will the king severely prosecute 'gainst us our lives our children and our heirs <eos> lord ross : the commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes and quite lost their hearts : the nobles hath he fined for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts <eos> lord willoughby : and daily new exactions are devised as blanks benevolences and i wot not what : but what o' god's name doth become of this <eos> northumberland : wars have not wasted it for warr'd he hath not but basely yielded upon compromise that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows : more hath he spent in peace than they in wars <eos> lord ross : the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm <eos> lord willoughby : the king's grown bankrupt like a broken man <eos> northumberland : reproach and dissolution hangeth over him <eos> lord ross : he hath not money for these irish wars his burthenous taxations notwithstanding but by the robbing of the banish'd duke <eos> northumberland : his noble kinsman : most degenerate king <eos> but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing yet see no shelter to avoid the storm we see the wind sit sore upon our sails and yet we strike not but securely perish <eos> lord ross : we see the very wreck that we must suffer and unavoided is the danger now for suffering so the causes of our wreck <eos> northumberland : not so even through the hollow eyes of death i spy life peering but i dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is <eos> lord willoughby : nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours <eos> lord ross : be confident to speak northumberland : we three are but thyself and speaking so thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold <eos> northumberland : then thus : i have from port le blanc a bay in brittany received intelligence that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham that late broke from the duke of exeter his brother archbishop late of canterbury sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagne with eight tall ships three thousand men of war are making hither with all due expedience and shortly mean to touch our northern shore : perhaps they had ere this but that they stay the first departing of the king for ireland <eos> if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke imp out our drooping country's broken wing redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt and make high majesty look like itself away with me in post to ravenspurgh but if you faint as fearing to do so stay and be secret and myself will go <eos> lord ross : to horse to horse <eos> urge doubts to them that fear <eos> lord willoughby : hold out my horse and i will first be there <eos> bushy : madam your majesty is too much sad : you promised when you parted with the king to lay aside life-harming heaviness and entertain a cheerful disposition <eos> queen : to please the king i did to please myself i cannot do it yet i know no cause why i should welcome such a guest as grief save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard : yet again methinks some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb is coming towards me and my inward soul with nothing trembles : at some thing it grieves more than with parting from my lord the king <eos> bushy : each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows which shows like grief itself but is not so for sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears divides one thing entire to many objects like perspectives which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion eyed awry distinguish form : so your sweet majesty looking awry upon your lord's departure find shapes of grief more than himself to wail which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows of what it is not <eos> then thrice-gracious queen more than your lord's departure weep not : more's not seen or if it be 'tis with false sorrow's eye which for things true weeps things imaginary <eos> queen : it may be so but yet my inward soul persuades me it is otherwise : howe'er it be i cannot but be sad so heavy sad as though on thinking on no thought i think makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink <eos> bushy : 'tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady <eos> queen : 'tis nothing less : conceit is still derived from some forefather grief mine is not so for nothing had begot my something grief or something hath the nothing that i grieve : 'tis in reversion that i do possess but what it is that is not yet known what i cannot name 'tis nameless woe i wot <eos> green : god save your majesty <eos> and well met gentlemen : i hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland <eos> queen : why hopest thou so <eos> 'tis better hope he is for his designs crave haste his haste good hope : then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd <eos> green : that he our hope might have retired his power and driven into despair an enemy's hope who strongly hath set footing in this land : the banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself and with uplifted arms is safe arrived at ravenspurgh <eos> queen : now god in heaven forbid <eos> green : ah madam 'tis too true : and that is worse the lord northumberland his son young henry percy the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby with all their powerful friends are fled to him <eos> bushy : why have you not proclaim'd northumberland and all the rest revolted faction traitors <eos> green : we have : whereupon the earl of worcester hath broke his staff resign'd his stewardship and all the household servants fled with him to bolingbroke <eos> queen : so green thou art the midwife to my woe and bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir : now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy and i a gasping new-deliver'd mother have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd <eos> bushy : despair not madam <eos> queen : who shall hinder me <eos> i will despair and be at enmity with cozening hope : he is a flatterer a parasite a keeper back of death who gently would dissolve the bands of life which false hope lingers in extremity <eos> green : here comes the duke of york <eos> queen : with signs of war about his aged neck : o full of careful business are his looks <eos> uncle for god's sake speak comfortable words <eos> duke of york : should i do so i should belie my thoughts : comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief <eos> your husband he is gone to save far off whilst others come to make him lose at home : here am i left to underprop his land who weak with age cannot support myself : now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him <eos> servant : my lord your son was gone before i came <eos> duke of york : he was <eos> why so <eos> go all which way it will <eos> the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold and will i fear revolt on hereford's side <eos> sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester bid her send me presently a thousand pound : hold take my ring <eos> servant : my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship to-day as i came by i called there but i shall grieve you to report the rest <eos> duke of york : what is't knave <eos> servant : an hour before i came the duchess died <eos> duke of york : god for his mercy <eos> what a tide of woes comes rushing on this woeful land at once <eos> i know not what to do : i would to god so my untruth had not provoked him to it the king had cut off my head with my brother's <eos> what are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland <eos> how shall we do for money for these wars <eos> come sister <eos>cousin i would say <eos>pray pardon me <eos> go fellow get thee home provide some carts and bring away the armour that is there <eos> gentlemen will you go muster men <eos> if i know how or which way to order these affairs thus thrust disorderly into my hands never believe me <eos> both are my kinsmen : the one is my sovereign whom both my oath and duty bids defend the other again is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong'd whom conscience and my kindred bids to right <eos> well somewhat we must do <eos> come cousin i'll dispose of you <eos> gentlemen go muster up your men and meet me presently at berkeley <eos> i should to plashy too but time will not permit : all is uneven and every thing is left at six and seven <eos> bushy : the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland but none returns <eos> for us to levy power proportionable to the enemy is all unpossible <eos> green : besides our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king <eos> bagot : and that's the wavering commons : for their love lies in their purses and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate <eos> bushy : wherein the king stands generally condemn'd <eos> bagot : if judgement lie in them then so do we because we ever have been near the king <eos> green : well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle : the earl of wiltshire is already there <eos> bushy : thither will i with you for little office the hateful commons will perform for us except like curs to tear us all to pieces <eos> will you go along with us <eos> bagot : no i will to ireland to his majesty <eos> farewell : if heart's presages be not vain we three here art that ne'er shall meet again <eos> bushy : that's as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke <eos> green : alas poor duke <eos> the task he undertakes is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry : where one on his side fights thousands will fly <eos> farewell at once for once for all and ever <eos> bushy : well we may meet again <eos> bagot : i fear me never <eos> henry bolingbroke : how far is it my lord to berkeley now <eos> northumberland : believe me noble lord i am a stranger here in gloucestershire : these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles and makes them wearisome and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar making the hard way sweet and delectable <eos> but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found in ross and willoughby wanting your company which i protest hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel : but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoy'd : by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short as mine hath done by sight of what i have your noble company <eos> henry bolingbroke : of much less value is my company than your good words <eos> but who comes here <eos> northumberland : it is my son young harry percy sent from my brother worcester whencesoever <eos> harry how fares your uncle <eos> henry percy : i had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you <eos> northumberland : why is he not with the queen <eos> henry percy : no my good lord he hath forsook the court broken his staff of office and dispersed the household of the king <eos> northumberland : what was his reason <eos> he was not so resolved when last we spake together <eos> henry percy : because your lordship was proclaimed traitor <eos> but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh to offer service to the duke of hereford and sent me over by berkeley to discover what power the duke of york had levied there then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh <eos> northumberland : have you forgot the duke of hereford boy <eos> henry percy : no my good lord for that is not forgot which ne'er i did remember : to my knowledge i never in my life did look on him <eos> northumberland : then learn to know him now this is the duke <eos> henry percy : my gracious lord i tender you my service such as it is being tender raw and young : which elder days shall ripen and confirm to more approved service and desert <eos> henry bolingbroke : i thank thee gentle percy and be sure i count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul remembering my good friends and as my fortune ripens with thy love it shall be still thy true love's recompense : my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it <eos> northumberland : how far is it to berkeley <eos> and what stir keeps good old york there with his men of war <eos> henry percy : there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees mann'd with three hundred men as i have heard and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour none else of name and noble estimate <eos> northumberland : here come the lords of ross and willoughby bloody with spurring fiery-red with haste <eos> henry bolingbroke : welcome my lords <eos> i wot your love pursues a banish'd traitor : all my treasury is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd shall be your love and labour's recompense <eos> lord ross : your presence makes us rich most noble lord <eos> lord willoughby : and far surmounts our labour to attain it <eos> henry bolingbroke : evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor which till my infant fortune comes to years stands for my bounty <eos> but who comes here <eos> northumberland : it is my lord of berkeley as i guess <eos> lord berkeley : my lord of hereford my message is to you <eos> henry bolingbroke : my lord my answer is <eos>to lancaster and i am come to seek that name in england and i must find that title in your tongue before i make reply to aught you say <eos> lord berkeley : mistake me not my lord 'tis not my meaning to raze one title of your honour out : to you my lord i come what lord you will from the most gracious regent of this land the duke of york to know what pricks you on to take advantage of the absent time and fright our native peace with self-born arms <eos> henry bolingbroke : i shall not need transport my words by you here comes his grace in person <eos> my noble uncle <eos> duke of york : show me thy humble heart and not thy knee whose duty is deceiveable and false <eos> henry bolingbroke : my gracious uncle <eos> duke of york : tut tut <eos> grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle : i am no traitor's uncle and that word 'grace <eos>' in an ungracious mouth is but profane <eos> why have those banish'd and forbidden legs dared once to touch a dust of england's ground <eos> but then more 'why <eos>' why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom frighting her pale-faced villages with war and ostentation of despised arms <eos> comest thou because the anointed king is hence <eos> why foolish boy the king is left behind and in my loyal bosom lies his power <eos> were i but now the lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt thy father and myself rescued the black prince that young mars of men from forth the ranks of many thousand french o then how quickly should this arm of mine <eos> now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee and minister correction to thy fault <eos> henry bolingbroke : my gracious uncle let me know my fault : on what condition stands it and wherein <eos> duke of york : even in condition of the worst degree in gross rebellion and detested treason : thou art a banish'd man and here art come before the expiration of thy time in braving arms against thy sovereign <eos> henry bolingbroke : as i was banish'd i was banish'd hereford but as i come i come for lancaster <eos> and noble uncle i beseech your grace look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye : you are my father for methinks in you i see old gaunt alive o then my father will you permit that i shall stand condemn'd a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away to upstart unthrifts <eos> wherefore was i born <eos> if that my cousin king be king of england it must be granted i am duke of lancaster <eos> you have a son aumerle my noble cousin had you first died and he been thus trod down he should have found his uncle gaunt a father to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay <eos> i am denied to sue my livery here and yet my letters-patents give me leave : my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold and these and all are all amiss employ'd <eos> what would you have me do <eos> i am a subject and i challenge law : attorneys are denied me and therefore personally i lay my claim to my inheritance of free descent <eos> northumberland : the noble duke hath been too much abused <eos> lord ross : it stands your grace upon to do him right <eos> lord willoughby : base men by his endowments are made great <eos> duke of york : my lords of england let me tell you this : i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs and laboured all i could to do him right but in this kind to come in braving arms be his own carver and cut out his way to find out right with wrong it may not be and you that do abet him in this kind cherish rebellion and are rebels all <eos> northumberland : the noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own and for the right of that we all have strongly sworn to give him aid and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath <eos> duke of york : well well i see the issue of these arms : i cannot mend it i must needs confess because my power is weak and all ill left : but if i could by him that gave me life i would attach you all and make you stoop unto the sovereign mercy of the king but since i cannot be it known to you i do remain as neuter <eos> so fare you well unless you please to enter in the castle and there repose you for this night <eos> henry bolingbroke : an offer uncle that we will accept : but we must win your grace to go with us to bristol castle which they say is held by bushy bagot and their complices the caterpillars of the commonwealth which i have sworn to weed and pluck away <eos> duke of york : it may be i will go with you : but yet i'll pause for i am loath to break our country's laws <eos> nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are : things past redress are now with me past care <eos> captain : my lord of salisbury we have stay'd ten days and hardly kept our countrymen together and yet we hear no tidings from the king therefore we will disperse ourselves : farewell <eos> earl of salisbury : stay yet another day thou trusty welshman : the king reposeth all his confidence in thee <eos> captain : 'tis thought the king is dead we will not stay <eos> the bay-trees in our country are all wither'd and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven the pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth and lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap the one in fear to lose what they enjoy the other to enjoy by rage and war : these signs forerun the death or fall of kings <eos> farewell : our countrymen are gone and fled as well assured richard their king is dead <eos> earl of salisbury : ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind i see thy glory like a shooting star fall to the base earth from the firmament <eos> thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west witnessing storms to come woe and unrest : thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes and crossly to thy good all fortune goes <eos> henry bolingbroke : bring forth these men <eos> bushy and green i will not vex your souls <eos> since presently your souls must part your bodies <eos> with too much urging your pernicious lives for 'twere no charity yet to wash your blood from off my hands here in the view of men i will unfold some causes of your deaths <eos> you have misled a prince a royal king a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments by you unhappied and disfigured clean : you have in manner with your sinful hours made a divorce betwixt his queen and him broke the possession of a royal bed and stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs <eos> myself a prince by fortune of my birth near to the king in blood and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me have stoop'd my neck under your injuries and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds eating the bitter bread of banishment whilst you have fed upon my signories dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods from my own windows torn my household coat razed out my imprese leaving me no sign save men's opinions and my living blood to show the world i am a gentleman <eos> this and much more much more than twice all this condemns you to the death <eos> see them deliver'd over to execution and the hand of death <eos> bushy : more welcome is the stroke of death to me than bolingbroke to england <eos> lords farewell <eos> green : my comfort is that heaven will take our souls and plague injustice with the pains of hell <eos> henry bolingbroke : my lord northumberland see them dispatch'd <eos> uncle you say the queen is at your house for god's sake fairly let her be entreated : tell her i send to her my kind commends take special care my greetings be deliver'd <eos> duke of york : a gentleman of mine i have dispatch'd with letters of your love to her at large <eos> henry bolingbroke : thank gentle uncle <eos> come lords away <eos> to fight with glendower and his complices : awhile to work and after holiday <eos> king richard ii : barkloughly castle call they this at hand <eos> duke of aumerle : yea my lord <eos> how brooks your grace the air after your late tossing on the breaking seas <eos> king richard ii : needs must i like it well : i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again <eos> dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs : as a long-parted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favours with my royal hands <eos> feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavy-gaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee : yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies <eos> mock not my senseless conjuration lords : this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion's arms <eos> bishop of carlisle : fear not my lord : that power that made you king hath power to keep you king in spite of all <eos> the means that heaven yields must be embraced and not neglected else if heaven would and we will not heaven's offer we refuse the proffer'd means of succor and redress <eos> duke of aumerle : he means my lord that we are too remiss whilst bolingbroke through our security grows strong and great in substance and in power <eos> king richard ii : discomfortable cousin <eos> know'st thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves <eos> so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath revell'd in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but self-affrighted tremble at his sin <eos> not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord : for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel : then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right <eos> welcome my lord how far off lies your power <eos> earl of salisbury : nor near nor farther off my gracious lord than this weak arm : discomfort guides my tongue and bids me speak of nothing but despair <eos> one day too late i fear me noble lord hath clouded all thy happy days on earth : o call back yesterday bid time return and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men <eos> to-day to-day unhappy day too late o'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state : for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead <eos> are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled <eos> duke of aumerle : comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale <eos> king richard ii : but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead <eos> all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride <eos> duke of aumerle : comfort my liege remember who you are <eos> king richard ii : i had forgot myself am i not king <eos> awake thou coward majesty <eos> thou sleepest <eos> is not the king's name twenty thousand names <eos> arm arm my name <eos> a puny subject strikes at thy great glory <eos> look not to the ground ye favourites of a king : are we not high <eos> high be our thoughts : i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn <eos> but who comes here <eos> sir stephen scroop : more health and happiness betide my liege than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him <eos> king richard ii : mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold <eos> say is my kingdom lost <eos> why 'twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care <eos> strives bolingbroke to be as great as we <eos> greater he shall not be if he serve god we'll serve him too and be his fellow so : revolt our subjects <eos> that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us : cry woe destruction ruin and decay : the worst is death and death will have his day <eos> sir stephen scroop : glad am i that your highness is so arm'd to bear the tidings of calamity <eos> like an unseasonable stormy day which makes the silver rivers drown their shores as if the world were all dissolved to tears so high above his limits swells the rage of bolingbroke covering your fearful land with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel <eos> white-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps against thy majesty boys with women's voices strive to speak big and clap their female joints in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown : the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows of double-fatal yew against thy state yea distaff-women manage rusty bills against thy seat : both young and old rebel and all goes worse than i have power to tell <eos> king richard ii : too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill <eos> where is the earl of wiltshire <eos> where is bagot <eos> what is become of bushy <eos> where is green <eos> that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps <eos> if we prevail their heads shall pay for it : i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke <eos> sir stephen scroop : peace have they made with him indeed my lord <eos> king richard ii : o villains vipers damn'd without redemption <eos> dogs easily won to fawn on any man <eos> snakes in my heart-blood warm'd that sting my heart <eos> three judases each one thrice worse than judas <eos> would they make peace <eos> terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this offence <eos> sir stephen scroop : sweet love i see changing his property turns to the sourest and most deadly hate : again uncurse their souls their peace is made with heads and not with hands those whom you curse have felt the worst of death's destroying wound and lie full low graved in the hollow ground <eos> duke of aumerle : is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead <eos> sir stephen scroop : ay all of them at bristol lost their heads <eos> duke of aumerle : where is the duke my father with his power <eos> king richard ii : no matter where of comfort no man speak : let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let's choose executors and talk of wills : and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground <eos> our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones <eos> for god's sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poison'd by their wives : some sleeping kill'd all murder'd : for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humour'd thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king <eos> cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence : throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while : i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends : subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king <eos> bishop of carlisle : my lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes but presently prevent the ways to wail <eos> to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength gives in your weakness strength unto your foe and so your follies fight against yourself <eos> fear and be slain no worse can come to fight : and fight and die is death destroying death where fearing dying pays death servile breath <eos> duke of aumerle : my father hath a power inquire of him and learn to make a body of a limb <eos> king richard ii : thou chidest me well : proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom <eos> this ague fit of fear is over-blown an easy task it is to win our own <eos> say scroop where lies our uncle with his power <eos> speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour <eos> sir stephen scroop : men judge by the complexion of the sky the state and inclination of the day : so may you by my dull and heavy eye my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say <eos> i play the torturer by small and small to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken : your uncle york is join'd with bolingbroke and all your northern castles yielded up and all your southern gentlemen in arms upon his party <eos> king richard ii : thou hast said enough <eos> beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth of that sweet way i was in to despair <eos> what say you now <eos> what comfort have we now <eos> by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort any more <eos> go to flint castle : there i'll pine away a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey <eos> that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for i have none : let no man speak again to alter this for counsel is but vain <eos> duke of aumerle : my liege one word <eos> king richard ii : he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue <eos> discharge my followers : let them hence away from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day <eos> henry bolingbroke : so that by this intelligence we learn the welshmen are dispersed and salisbury is gone to meet the king who lately landed with some few private friends upon this coast <eos> northumberland : the news is very fair and good my lord : richard not far from hence hath hid his head <eos> duke of york : it would beseem the lord northumberland to say 'king richard :' alack the heavy day when such a sacred king should hide his head <eos> northumberland : your grace mistakes only to be brief left i his title out <eos> duke of york : the time hath been would you have been so brief with him he would have been so brief with you to shorten you for taking so the head your whole head's length <eos> henry bolingbroke : mistake not uncle further than you should <eos> duke of york : take not good cousin further than you should <eos> lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads <eos> henry bolingbroke : i know it uncle and oppose not myself against their will <eos> but who comes here <eos> welcome harry : what will not this castle yield <eos> henry percy : the castle royally is mann'd my lord against thy entrance <eos> henry bolingbroke : royally <eos> why it contains no king <eos> henry percy : yes my good lord it doth contain a king king richard lies within the limits of yon lime and stone : and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman of holy reverence who i cannot learn <eos> northumberland : o belike it is the bishop of carlisle <eos> henry bolingbroke : noble lords go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver : henry bolingbroke on both his knees doth kiss king richard's hand and sends allegiance and true faith of heart to his most royal person hither come even at his feet to lay my arms and power provided that my banishment repeal'd and lands restored again be freely granted : if not i'll use the advantage of my power and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen : the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke it is such crimson tempest should bedrench the fresh green lap of fair king richard's land my stooping duty tenderly shall show <eos> go signify as much while here we march upon the grassy carpet of this plain <eos> let's march without the noise of threatening drum that from this castle's tatter'd battlements our fair appointments may be well perused <eos> methinks king richard and myself should meet with no less terror than the elements of fire and water when their thundering shock at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven <eos> be he the fire i'll be the yielding water : the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain my waters on the earth and not on him <eos> march on and mark king richard how he looks <eos> see see king richard doth himself appear as doth the blushing discontented sun from out the fiery portal of the east when he perceives the envious clouds are bent to dim his glory and to stain the track of his bright passage to the occident <eos> duke of york : yet looks he like a king : behold his eye as bright as is the eagle's lightens forth controlling majesty : alack alack for woe that any harm should stain so fair a show <eos> king richard ii : we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee because we thought ourself thy lawful king : and if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence <eos> if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre unless he do profane steal or usurp <eos> and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown <eos> tell bolingbroke <eos>for yond methinks he stands <eos> that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason : he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons shall ill become the flower of england's face change the complexion of her maid-pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures' grass with faithful english blood <eos> northumberland : the king of heaven forbid our lord the king should so with civil and uncivil arms be rush'd upon <eos> thy thrice noble cousin harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand and by the honourable tomb he swears that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones and by the royalties of both your bloods currents that spring from one most gracious head and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt and by the worth and honour of himself comprising all that may be sworn or said his coming hither hath no further scope than for his lineal royalties and to beg enfranchisement immediate on his knees : which on thy royal party granted once his glittering arms he will commend to rust his barbed steeds to stables and his heart to faithful service of your majesty <eos> this swears he as he is a prince is just and as i am a gentleman i credit him <eos> king richard ii : northumberland say thus the king returns : his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplish'd without contradiction : with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends <eos> we do debase ourselves cousin do we not to look so poorly and to speak so fair <eos> shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die <eos> duke of aumerle : no good my lord let's fight with gentle words till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords <eos> king richard ii : o god o god <eos> that e'er this tongue of mine that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man should take it off again with words of sooth <eos> o that i were as great as is my grief or lesser than my name <eos> or that i could forget what i have been or not remember what i must be now <eos> swell'st thou proud heart <eos> i'll give thee scope to beat since foes have scope to beat both thee and me <eos> duke of aumerle : northumberland comes back from bolingbroke <eos> king richard ii : what must the king do now <eos> must he submit <eos> the king shall do it : must he be deposed <eos> the king shall be contented : must he lose the name of king <eos> o' god's name let it go : i'll give my jewels for a set of beads my gorgeous palace for a hermitage my gay apparel for an almsman's gown my figured goblets for a dish of wood my sceptre for a palmer's walking staff my subjects for a pair of carved saints and my large kingdom for a little grave a little little grave an obscure grave or i'll be buried in the king's highway some way of common trade where subjects' feet may hourly trample on their sovereign's head for on my heart they tread now whilst i live and buried once why not upon my head <eos> aumerle thou weep'st my tender-hearted cousin <eos> we'll make foul weather with despised tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land <eos> or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears <eos> as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laid <eos>there lies two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes <eos> would not this ill do well <eos> well well i see i talk but idly and you laugh at me <eos> most mighty prince my lord northumberland what says king bolingbroke <eos> will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard die <eos> you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay <eos> northumberland : my lord in the base court he doth attend to speak with you may it please you to come down <eos> king richard ii : down down i come like glistering phaethon wanting the manage of unruly jades <eos> in the base court <eos> base court where kings grow base to come at traitors' calls and do them grace <eos> in the base court <eos> come down <eos> down court <eos> down king <eos> for night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing <eos> henry bolingbroke : what says his majesty <eos> northumberland : sorrow and grief of heart makes him speak fondly like a frantic man yet he is come <eos> henry bolingbroke : stand all apart and show fair duty to his majesty <eos> my gracious lord <eos> king richard ii : fair cousin you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it : me rather had my heart might feel your love than my unpleased eye see your courtesy <eos> up cousin up your heart is up i know thus high at least although your knee be low <eos> henry bolingbroke : my gracious lord i come but for mine own <eos> king richard ii : your own is yours and i am yours and all <eos> henry bolingbroke : so far be mine my most redoubted lord as my true service shall deserve your love <eos> king richard ii : well you deserve : they well deserve to have that know the strong'st and surest way to get <eos> uncle give me your hands : nay dry your eyes tears show their love but want their remedies <eos> cousin i am too young to be your father though you are old enough to be my heir <eos> what you will have i'll give and willing too for do we must what force will have us do <eos> set on towards london cousin is it so <eos> henry bolingbroke : yea my good lord <eos> king richard ii : then i must not say no <eos> queen : what sport shall we devise here in this garden to drive away the heavy thought of care <eos> lady : madam we'll play at bowls <eos> queen : 'twill make me think the world is full of rubs and that my fortune rubs against the bias <eos> lady : madam we'll dance <eos> queen : my legs can keep no measure in delight when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief : therefore no dancing girl some other sport <eos> lady : madam we'll tell tales <eos> queen : of sorrow or of joy <eos> lady : of either madam <eos> queen : of neither girl : for of joy being altogether wanting it doth remember me the more of sorrow or if of grief being altogether had it adds more sorrow to my want of joy : for what i have i need not to repeat and what i want it boots not to complain <eos> lady : madam i'll sing <eos> queen : 'tis well that thou hast cause but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep <eos> lady : i could weep madam would it do you good <eos> queen : and i could sing would weeping do me good and never borrow any tear of thee <eos> but stay here come the gardeners : let's step into the shadow of these trees <eos> my wretchedness unto a row of pins they'll talk of state for every one doth so against a change woe is forerun with woe <eos> gardener : go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks which like unruly children make their sire stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight : give some supportance to the bending twigs <eos> go thou and like an executioner cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays that look too lofty in our commonwealth : all must be even in our government <eos> you thus employ'd i will go root away the noisome weeds which without profit suck the soil's fertility from wholesome flowers <eos> servant : why should we in the compass of a pale keep law and form and due proportion showing as in a model our firm estate when our sea-walled garden the whole land is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up her fruit-trees all upturned her hedges ruin'd her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs swarming with caterpillars <eos> gardener : hold thy peace : he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring hath now himself met with the fall of leaf : the weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter that seem'd in eating him to hold him up are pluck'd up root and all by bolingbroke i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green <eos> servant : what are they dead <eos> gardener : they are and bolingbroke hath seized the wasteful king <eos> o what pity is it that he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land as we this garden <eos> we at time of year do wound the bark the skin of our fruit-trees lest being over-proud in sap and blood with too much riches it confound itself : had he done so to great and growing men they might have lived to bear and he to taste their fruits of duty : superfluous branches we lop away that bearing boughs may live : had he done so himself had borne the crown which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down <eos> servant : what think you then the king shall be deposed <eos> gardener : depress'd he is already and deposed 'tis doubt he will be : letters came last night to a dear friend of the good duke of york's that tell black tidings <eos> queen : o i am press'd to death through want of speaking <eos> thou old adam's likeness set to dress this garden how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news <eos> what eve what serpent hath suggested thee to make a second fall of cursed man <eos> why dost thou say king richard is deposed <eos> darest thou thou little better thing than earth divine his downfall <eos> say where when and how camest thou by this ill tidings <eos> speak thou wretch <eos> gardener : pardon me madam : little joy have i to breathe this news yet what i say is true <eos> king richard he is in the mighty hold of bolingbroke : their fortunes both are weigh'd : in your lord's scale is nothing but himself and some few vanities that make him light but in the balance of great bolingbroke besides himself are all the english peers and with that odds he weighs king richard down <eos> post you to london and you will find it so i speak no more than every one doth know <eos> queen : nimble mischance that art so light of foot doth not thy embassage belong to me and am i last that knows it <eos> o thou think'st to serve me last that i may longest keep thy sorrow in my breast <eos> come ladies go to meet at london london's king in woe <eos> what was i born to this that my sad look should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke <eos> gardener for telling me these news of woe pray god the plants thou graft'st may never grow <eos> gardener : poor queen <eos> so that thy state might be no worse i would my skill were subject to thy curse <eos> here did she fall a tear here in this place i'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace : rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen in the remembrance of a weeping queen <eos> henry bolingbroke : call forth bagot <eos> now bagot freely speak thy mind what thou dost know of noble gloucester's death who wrought it with the king and who perform'd the bloody office of his timeless end <eos> bagot : then set before my face the lord aumerle <eos> henry bolingbroke : cousin stand forth and look upon that man <eos> bagot : my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd <eos> in that dead time when gloucester's death was plotted i heard you say 'is not my arm of length that reacheth from the restful english court as far as calais to mine uncle's head <eos>' amongst much other talk that very time i heard you say that you had rather refuse the offer of an hundred thousand crowns than bolingbroke's return to england adding withal how blest this land would be in this your cousin's death <eos> duke of aumerle : princes and noble lords what answer shall i make to this base man <eos> shall i so much dishonour my fair stars on equal terms to give him chastisement <eos> either i must or have mine honour soil'd with the attainder of his slanderous lips <eos> there is my gage the manual seal of death that marks thee out for hell : i say thou liest and will maintain what thou hast said is false in thy heart-blood though being all too base to stain the temper of my knightly sword <eos> henry bolingbroke : bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up <eos> duke of aumerle : excepting one i would he were the best in all this presence that hath moved me so <eos> lord fitzwater : if that thy valour stand on sympathy there is my gage aumerle in gage to thine : by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st i heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it that thou wert cause of noble gloucester's death <eos> if thou deny'st it twenty times thou liest and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart where it was forged with my rapier's point <eos> duke of aumerle : thou darest not coward live to see that day <eos> lord fitzwater : now by my soul i would it were this hour <eos> duke of aumerle : fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this <eos> henry percy : aumerle thou liest his honour is as true in this appeal as thou art all unjust and that thou art so there i throw my gage to prove it on thee to the extremest point of mortal breathing : seize it if thou darest <eos> duke of aumerle : an if i do not may my hands rot off and never brandish more revengeful steel over the glittering helmet of my foe <eos> lord : i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle and spur thee on with full as many lies as may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear from sun to sun : there is my honour's pawn engage it to the trial if thou darest <eos> duke of aumerle : who sets me else <eos> by heaven i'll throw at all : i have a thousand spirits in one breast to answer twenty thousand such as you <eos> duke of surrey : my lord fitzwater i do remember well the very time aumerle and you did talk <eos> lord fitzwater : 'tis very true : you were in presence then and you can witness with me this is true <eos> duke of surrey : as false by heaven as heaven itself is true <eos> lord fitzwater : surrey thou liest <eos> duke of surrey : dishonourable boy <eos> that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword that it shall render vengeance and revenge till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie in earth as quiet as thy father's skull : in proof whereof there is my honour's pawn engage it to the trial if thou darest <eos> lord fitzwater : how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse <eos> if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live i dare meet surrey in a wilderness and spit upon him whilst i say he lies and lies and lies : there is my bond of faith to tie thee to my strong correction <eos> as i intend to thrive in this new world aumerle is guilty of my true appeal : besides i heard the banish'd norfolk say that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men to execute the noble duke at calais <eos> duke of aumerle : some honest christian trust me with a gage that norfolk lies : here do i throw down this if he may be repeal'd to try his honour <eos> henry bolingbroke : these differences shall all rest under gage till norfolk be repeal'd : repeal'd he shall be and though mine enemy restored again to all his lands and signories : when he's return'd against aumerle we will enforce his trial <eos> bishop of carlisle : that honourable day shall ne'er be seen <eos> many a time hath banish'd norfolk fought for jesu christ in glorious christian field streaming the ensign of the christian cross against black pagans turks and saracens : and toil'd with works of war retired himself to italy and there at venice gave his body to that pleasant country's earth and his pure soul unto his captain christ under whose colours he had fought so long <eos> henry bolingbroke : why bishop is norfolk dead <eos> bishop of carlisle : as surely as i live my lord <eos> henry bolingbroke : sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom of good old abraham <eos> lords appellants your differences shall all rest under gage till we assign you to your days of trial <eos> duke of york : great duke of lancaster i come to thee from plume-pluck'd richard who with willing soul adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields to the possession of thy royal hand : ascend his throne descending now from him and long live henry fourth of that name <eos> henry bolingbroke : in god's name i'll ascend the regal throne <eos> bishop of carlisle : marry <eos> god forbid <eos> worst in this royal presence may i speak yet best beseeming me to speak the truth <eos> would god that any in this noble presence were enough noble to be upright judge of noble richard <eos> then true noblesse would learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong <eos> what subject can give sentence on his king <eos> and who sits here that is not richard's subject <eos> thieves are not judged but they are by to hear although apparent guilt be seen in them and shall the figure of god's majesty his captain steward deputy-elect anointed crowned planted many years be judged by subject and inferior breath and he himself not present <eos> o forfend it god that in a christian climate souls refined should show so heinous black obscene a deed <eos> i speak to subjects and a subject speaks stirr'd up by god thus boldly for his king : my lord of hereford here whom you call king is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king : and if you crown him let me prophesy : the blood of english shall manure the ground and future ages groan for this foul act peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound disorder horror fear and mutiny shall here inhabit and this land be call'd the field of golgotha and dead men's skulls <eos> o if you raise this house against this house it will the woefullest division prove that ever fell upon this cursed earth <eos> prevent it resist it let it not be so lest child child's children cry against you woe <eos> northumberland : well have you argued sir and for your pains of capital treason we arrest you here <eos> my lord of westminster be it your charge to keep him safely till his day of trial <eos> may it please you lords to grant the commons' suit <eos> henry bolingbroke : fetch hither richard that in common view he may surrender so we shall proceed without suspicion <eos> duke of york : i will be his conduct <eos> henry bolingbroke : lords you that here are under our arrest procure your sureties for your days of answer <eos> little are we beholding to your love and little look'd for at your helping hands <eos> king richard ii : alack why am i sent for to a king before i have shook off the regal thoughts wherewith i reign'd <eos> i hardly yet have learn'd to insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs : give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission <eos> yet i well remember the favours of these men : were they not mine <eos> did they not sometime cry 'all hail <eos>' to me <eos> so judas did to christ : but he in twelve found truth in all but one : i in twelve thousand none <eos> god save the king <eos> will no man say amen <eos> am i both priest and clerk <eos> well then amen <eos> god save the king <eos> although i be not he and yet amen if heaven do think him me <eos> to do what service am i sent for hither <eos> duke of york : to do that office of thine own good will which tired majesty did make thee offer the resignation of thy state and crown to henry bolingbroke <eos> king richard ii : give me the crown <eos> here cousin seize the crown here cousin : on this side my hand and on that side yours <eos> now is this golden crown like a deep well that owes two buckets filling one another the emptier ever dancing in the air the other down unseen and full of water : that bucket down and full of tears am i drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high <eos> henry bolingbroke : i thought you had been willing to resign <eos> king richard ii : my crown i am but still my griefs are mine : you may my glories and my state depose but not my griefs still am i king of those <eos> henry bolingbroke : part of your cares you give me with your crown <eos> king richard ii : your cares set up do not pluck my cares down <eos> my care is loss of care by old care done your care is gain of care by new care won : the cares i give i have though given away they tend the crown yet still with me they stay <eos> henry bolingbroke : are you contented to resign the crown <eos> king richard ii : ay no no ay for i must nothing be therefore no no for i resign to thee <eos> now mark me how i will undo myself i give this heavy weight from off my head and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand the pride of kingly sway from out my heart with mine own tears i wash away my balm with mine own hands i give away my crown with mine own tongue deny my sacred state with mine own breath release all duty's rites : all pomp and majesty i do forswear my manors rents revenues i forego my acts decrees and statutes i deny : god pardon all oaths that are broke to me <eos> god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee <eos> make me that nothing have with nothing grieved and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved <eos> long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit and soon lie richard in an earthly pit <eos> god save king harry unking'd richard says and send him many years of sunshine days <eos> what more remains <eos> northumberland : no more but that you read these accusations and these grievous crimes committed by your person and your followers against the state and profit of this land that by confessing them the souls of men may deem that you are worthily deposed <eos> king richard ii : must i do so <eos> and must i ravel out my weaved-up folly <eos> gentle northumberland if thy offences were upon record would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them <eos> if thou wouldst there shouldst thou find one heinous article containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven : nay all of you that stand and look upon whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity yet you pilates have here deliver'd me to my sour cross and water cannot wash away your sin <eos> northumberland : my lord dispatch read o'er these articles <eos> king richard ii : mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see : and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here <eos> nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself i find myself a traitor with the rest for i have given here my soul's consent to undeck the pompous body of a king made glory base and sovereignty a slave proud majesty a subject state a peasant <eos> northumberland : my lord <eos> king richard ii : no lord of thine thou haught insulting man nor no man's lord i have no name no title no not that name was given me at the font but 'tis usurp'd : alack the heavy day that i have worn so many winters out and know not now what name to call myself <eos> o that i were a mockery king of snow standing before the sun of bolingbroke to melt myself away in water-drops <eos> good king great king and yet not greatly good an if my word be sterling yet in england let it command a mirror hither straight that it may show me what a face i have since it is bankrupt of his majesty <eos> henry bolingbroke : go some of you and fetch a looking-glass <eos> northumberland : read o'er this paper while the glass doth come <eos> king richard ii : fiend thou torment'st me ere i come to hell <eos> henry bolingbroke : urge it no more my lord northumberland <eos> northumberland : the commons will not then be satisfied <eos> king richard ii : they shall be satisfied : i'll read enough when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ and that's myself <eos> give me the glass and therein will i read <eos> no deeper wrinkles yet <eos> hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine and made no deeper wounds <eos> o flattering glass like to my followers in prosperity thou dost beguile me <eos> was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men <eos> was this the face that like the sun did make beholders wink <eos> was this the face that faced so many follies and was at last out-faced by bolingbroke <eos> a brittle glory shineth in this face : as brittle as the glory is the face for there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers <eos> mark silent king the moral of this sport how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face <eos> henry bolingbroke : the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd the shadow or your face <eos> king richard ii : say that again <eos> the shadow of my sorrow <eos> ha <eos> let's see : 'tis very true my grief lies all within and these external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul there lies the substance : and i thank thee king for thy great bounty that not only givest me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause <eos> i'll beg one boon and then be gone and trouble you no more <eos> shall i obtain it <eos> henry bolingbroke : name it fair cousin <eos> king richard ii : 'fair cousin' <eos> i am greater than a king : for when i was a king my flatterers were then but subjects being now a subject i have a king here to my flatterer <eos> being so great i have no need to beg <eos> henry bolingbroke : yet ask <eos> king richard ii : and shall i have <eos> henry bolingbroke : you shall <eos> king richard ii : then give me leave to go <eos> henry bolingbroke : whither <eos> king richard ii : whither you will so i were from your sights <eos> henry bolingbroke : go some of you convey him to the tower <eos> king richard ii : o good <eos> convey <eos> conveyers are you all that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall <eos> henry bolingbroke : on wednesday next we solemnly set down our coronation : lords prepare yourselves <eos> abbot : a woeful pageant have we here beheld <eos> bishop of carlisle : the woe's to come the children yet unborn <eos> shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn <eos> duke of aumerle : you holy clergymen is there no plot to rid the realm of this pernicious blot <eos> abbot : my lord before i freely speak my mind herein you shall not only take the sacrament to bury mine intents but also to effect whatever i shall happen to devise <eos> i see your brows are full of discontent your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears : come home with me to supper and i'll lay a plot shall show us all a merry day <eos> queen : this way the king will come this is the way to julius caesar's ill-erected tower to whose flint bosom my condemned lord is doom'd a prisoner by proud bolingbroke : here let us rest if this rebellious earth have any resting for her true king's queen <eos> but soft but see or rather do not see my fair rose wither : yet look up behold that you in pity may dissolve to dew and wash him fresh again with true-love tears <eos> ah thou the model where old troy did stand thou map of honour thou king richard's tomb and not king richard thou most beauteous inn why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee when triumph is become an alehouse guest <eos> king richard ii : join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden : learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shows us but this : i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death <eos> hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house : our holy lives must win a new world's crown which our profane hours here have stricken down <eos> queen : what is my richard both in shape and mind transform'd and weaken'd <eos> hath bolingbroke deposed thine intellect <eos> hath he been in thy heart <eos> the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage to be o'erpower'd and wilt thou pupil-like take thy correction mildly kiss the rod and fawn on rage with base humility which art a lion and a king of beasts <eos> king richard ii : a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts i had been still a happy king of men <eos> good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france : think i am dead and that even here thou takest as from my death-bed thy last living leave <eos> in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds : for why the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out and some will mourn in ashes some coal-black for the deposing of a rightful king <eos> northumberland : my lord the mind of bolingbroke is changed : you must to pomfret not unto the tower <eos> and madam there is order ta'en for you with all swift speed you must away to france <eos> king richard ii : northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shalt break into corruption : thou shalt think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all and he shall think that thou which know'st the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being ne'er so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne <eos> the love of wicked men converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserved death <eos> northumberland : my guilt be on my head and there an end <eos> take leave and part for you must part forthwith <eos> king richard ii : doubly divorced <eos> bad men you violate a twofold marriage 'twixt my crown and me and then betwixt me and my married wife <eos> let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me and yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made <eos> part us northumberland i toward the north where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime my wife to france : from whence set forth in pomp she came adorned hither like sweet may sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day <eos> queen : and must we be divided <eos> must we part <eos> king richard ii : ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart <eos> queen : banish us both and send the king with me <eos> northumberland : that were some love but little policy <eos> queen : then whither he goes thither let me go <eos> king richard ii : so two together weeping make one woe <eos> weep thou for me in france i for thee here better far off than near be ne'er the near <eos> go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans <eos> queen : so longest way shall have the longest moans <eos> king richard ii : twice for one step i'll groan the way being short and piece the way out with a heavy heart <eos> come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief since wedding it there is such length in grief one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart <eos> queen : give me mine own again 'twere no good part to take on me to keep and kill thy heart <eos> so now i have mine own again be gone that i might strive to kill it with a groan <eos> king richard ii : we make woe wanton with this fond delay : once more adieu the rest let sorrow say <eos> duchess of york : my lord you told me you would tell the rest when weeping made you break the story off of our two cousins coming into london <eos> duke of york : where did i leave <eos> duchess of york : at that sad stop my lord where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops threw dust and rubbish on king richard's head <eos> duke of york : then as i said the duke great bolingbroke mounted upon a hot and fiery steed which his aspiring rider seem'd to know with slow but stately pace kept on his course whilst all tongues cried 'god save thee bolingbroke <eos>' you would have thought the very windows spake so many greedy looks of young and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once 'jesu preserve thee <eos> welcome bolingbroke <eos>' whilst he from the one side to the other turning bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck bespake them thus : 'i thank you countrymen :' and thus still doing thus he pass'd along <eos> duchess of york : alack poor richard <eos> where rode he the whilst <eos> duke of york : as in a theatre the eyes of men after a well-graced actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next thinking his prattle to be tedious even so or with much more contempt men's eyes did scowl on gentle richard no man cried 'god save him <eos>' no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home : but dust was thrown upon his sacred head : which with such gentle sorrow he shook off his face still combating with tears and smiles the badges of his grief and patience that had not god for some strong purpose steel'd the hearts of men they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him <eos> but heaven hath a hand in these events to whose high will we bound our calm contents <eos> to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now whose state and honour i for aye allow <eos> duchess of york : here comes my son aumerle <eos> duke of york : aumerle that was but that is lost for being richard's friend and madam you must call him rutland now : i am in parliament pledge for his truth and lasting fealty to the new-made king <eos> duchess of york : welcome my son : who are the violets now that strew the green lap of the new come spring <eos> duke of aumerle : madam i know not nor i greatly care not : god knows i had as lief be none as one <eos> duke of york : well bear you well in this new spring of time lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime <eos> what news from oxford <eos> hold those justs and triumphs <eos> duke of aumerle : for aught i know my lord they do <eos> duke of york : you will be there i know <eos> duke of aumerle : if god prevent not i purpose so <eos> duke of york : what seal is that that hangs without thy bosom <eos> yea look'st thou pale <eos> let me see the writing <eos> duke of aumerle : my lord 'tis nothing <eos> duke of york : no matter then who see it i will be satisfied let me see the writing <eos> duke of aumerle : i do beseech your grace to pardon me : it is a matter of small consequence which for some reasons i would not have seen <eos> duke of york : which for some reasons sir i mean to see <eos> i fear i fear <eos> duchess of york : what should you fear <eos> 'tis nothing but some bond that he is enter'd into for gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day <eos> duke of york : bound to himself <eos> what doth he with a bond that he is bound to <eos> wife thou art a fool <eos> boy let me see the writing <eos> duke of aumerle : i do beseech you pardon me i may not show it <eos> duke of york : i will be satisfied let me see it i say <eos> treason <eos> foul treason <eos> villain <eos> traitor <eos> slave <eos> duchess of york : what is the matter my lord <eos> duke of york : ho <eos> who is within there <eos> saddle my horse <eos> god for his mercy what treachery is here <eos> duchess of york : why what is it my lord <eos> duke of york : give me my boots i say saddle my horse <eos> now by mine honour by my life by my troth i will appeach the villain <eos> duchess of york : what is the matter <eos> duke of york : peace foolish woman <eos> duchess of york : i will not peace <eos> what is the matter aumerle <eos> duke of aumerle : good mother be content it is no more than my poor life must answer <eos> duchess of york : thy life answer <eos> duke of york : bring me my boots : i will unto the king <eos> duchess of york : strike him aumerle <eos> poor boy thou art amazed <eos> hence villain <eos> never more come in my sight <eos> duke of york : give me my boots i say <eos> duchess of york : why york what wilt thou do <eos> wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own <eos> have we more sons <eos> or are we like to have <eos> is not my teeming date drunk up with time <eos> and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age and rob me of a happy mother's name <eos> is he not like thee <eos> is he not thine own <eos> duke of york : thou fond mad woman wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy <eos> a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament and interchangeably set down their hands to kill the king at oxford <eos> duchess of york : he shall be none we'll keep him here : then what is that to him <eos> duke of york : away fond woman <eos> were he twenty times my son i would appeach him <eos> duchess of york : hadst thou groan'd for him as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful <eos> but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect that i have been disloyal to thy bed and that he is a bastard not thy son : sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind : he is as like thee as a man may be not like to me or any of my kin and yet i love him <eos> duke of york : make way unruly woman <eos> duchess of york : after aumerle <eos> mount thee upon his horse spur post and get before him to the king and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee <eos> i'll not be long behind though i be old i doubt not but to ride as fast as york : and never will i rise up from the ground till bolingbroke have pardon'd thee <eos> away be gone <eos> henry bolingbroke : can no man tell me of my unthrifty son <eos> 'tis full three months since i did see him last if any plague hang over us 'tis he <eos> i would to god my lords he might be found : inquire at london 'mongst the taverns there for there they say he daily doth frequent with unrestrained loose companions even such they say as stand in narrow lanes and beat our watch and rob our passengers which he young wanton and effeminate boy takes on the point of honour to support so dissolute a crew <eos> henry percy : my lord some two days since i saw the prince and told him of those triumphs held at oxford <eos> henry bolingbroke : and what said the gallant <eos> henry percy : his answer was he would unto the stews and from the common'st creature pluck a glove and wear it as a favour and with that he would unhorse the lustiest challenger <eos> henry bolingbroke : as dissolute as desperate yet through both i see some sparks of better hope which elder years may happily bring forth <eos> but who comes here <eos> duke of aumerle : where is the king <eos> henry bolingbroke : what means our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly <eos> duke of aumerle : god save your grace <eos> i do beseech your majesty to have some conference with your grace alone <eos> henry bolingbroke : withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone <eos> what is the matter with our cousin now <eos> duke of aumerle : for ever may my knees grow to the earth my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth unless a pardon ere i rise or speak <eos> henry bolingbroke : intended or committed was this fault <eos> if on the first how heinous e'er it be to win thy after-love i pardon thee <eos> duke of aumerle : then give me leave that i may turn the key that no man enter till my tale be done <eos> henry bolingbroke : have thy desire <eos> duke of york : henry bolingbroke : villain i'll make thee safe <eos> duke of aumerle : stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear <eos> duke of york : henry bolingbroke : what is the matter uncle <eos> speak recover breath tell us how near is danger that we may arm us to encounter it <eos> duke of york : peruse this writing here and thou shalt know the treason that my haste forbids me show <eos> duke of aumerle : remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd : i do repent me read not my name there my heart is not confederate with my hand <eos> duke of york : it was villain ere thy hand did set it down <eos> i tore it from the traitor's bosom king fear and not love begets his penitence : forget to pity him lest thy pity prove a serpent that will sting thee to the heart <eos> henry bolingbroke : o heinous strong and bold conspiracy <eos> o loyal father of a treacherous son <eos> thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain from when this stream through muddy passages hath held his current and defiled himself <eos> thy overflow of good converts to bad and thy abundant goodness shall excuse this deadly blot in thy digressing son <eos> duke of york : so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd and he shall spend mine honour with his shame as thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold <eos> mine honour lives when his dishonour dies or my shamed life in his dishonour lies : thou kill'st me in his life giving him breath the traitor lives the true man's put to death <eos> duchess of york : henry bolingbroke : what shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry <eos> duchess of york : a woman and thy aunt great king 'tis i <eos> speak with me pity me open the door <eos> a beggar begs that never begg'd before <eos> henry bolingbroke : our scene is alter'd from a serious thing and now changed to 'the beggar and the king <eos>' my dangerous cousin let your mother in : i know she is come to pray for your foul sin <eos> duke of york : if thou do pardon whosoever pray more sins for this forgiveness prosper may <eos> this fester'd joint cut off the rest rest sound this let alone will all the rest confound <eos> duchess of york : o king believe not this hard-hearted man <eos> love loving not itself none other can <eos> duke of york : thou frantic woman what dost thou make here <eos> shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear <eos> duchess of york : sweet york be patient <eos> hear me gentle liege <eos> henry bolingbroke : rise up good aunt <eos> duchess of york : not yet i thee beseech : for ever will i walk upon my knees and never see day that the happy sees till thou give joy until thou bid me joy by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy <eos> duke of aumerle : unto my mother's prayers i bend my knee <eos> duke of york : against them both my true joints bended be <eos> ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace <eos> duchess of york : pleads he in earnest <eos> look upon his face his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest his words come from his mouth ours from our breast : he prays but faintly and would be denied we pray with heart and soul and all beside : his weary joints would gladly rise i know our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow : his prayers are full of false hypocrisy ours of true zeal and deep integrity <eos> our prayers do out-pray his then let them have that mercy which true prayer ought to have <eos> henry bolingbroke : good aunt stand up <eos> duchess of york : nay do not say 'stand up' say 'pardon' first and afterwards 'stand up <eos>' and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach 'pardon' should be the first word of thy speech <eos> i never long'd to hear a word till now say 'pardon' king let pity teach thee how : the word is short but not so short as sweet no word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet <eos> duke of york : speak it in french king say 'pardonne moi <eos>' duchess of york : dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy <eos> ah my sour husband my hard-hearted lord that set'st the word itself against the word <eos> speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land the chopping french we do not understand <eos> thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse <eos> henry bolingbroke : good aunt stand up <eos> duchess of york : i do not sue to stand pardon is all the suit i have in hand <eos> henry bolingbroke : i pardon him as god shall pardon me <eos> duchess of york : o happy vantage of a kneeling knee <eos> yet am i sick for fear : speak it again twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain but makes one pardon strong <eos> henry bolingbroke : with all my heart i pardon him <eos> duchess of york : a god on earth thou art <eos> henry bolingbroke : but for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot with all the rest of that consorted crew destruction straight shall dog them at the heels <eos> good uncle help to order several powers to oxford or where'er these traitors are : they shall not live within this world i swear but i will have them if i once know where <eos> uncle farewell : and cousin too adieu : your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true <eos> duchess of york : come my old son : i pray god make thee new <eos> exton : didst thou not mark the king what words he spake 'have i no friend will rid me of this living fear <eos>' was it not so <eos> servant : these were his very words <eos> exton : 'have i no friend <eos>' quoth he : he spake it twice and urged it twice together did he not <eos> servant : he did <eos> exton : and speaking it he wistly look'd on me and who should say 'i would thou wert the man' that would divorce this terror from my heart' meaning the king at pomfret <eos> come let's go : i am the king's friend and will rid his foe <eos> king richard ii : i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world : and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out <eos> my brain i'll prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of still-breeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humours like the people of this world for no thought is contented <eos> the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermix'd with scruples and do set the word itself against the word : as thus 'come little ones' and then again 'it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needle's eye <eos>' thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride <eos> thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune's slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like <eos> thus play i in one person many people and none contented : sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am : then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i king'd again : and by and by think that i am unking'd by bolingbroke and straight am nothing : but whate'er i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing <eos> music do i hear <eos> ha ha <eos> keep time : how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept <eos> so is it in the music of men's lives <eos> and here have i the daintiness of ear to cheque time broke in a disorder'd string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke <eos> i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numbering clock : my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dial's point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears <eos> now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell : so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours : but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack o' the clock <eos> this music mads me let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad <eos> yet blessing on his heart that gives it me <eos> for 'tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this all-hating world <eos> groom : hail royal prince <eos> king richard ii : thanks noble peer the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear <eos> what art thou <eos> and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live <eos> groom : i was a poor groom of thy stable king when thou wert king who travelling towards york with much ado at length have gotten leave to look upon my sometimes royal master's face <eos> o how it yearn'd my heart when i beheld in london streets that coronation-day when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary that horse that thou so often hast bestrid that horse that i so carefully have dress'd <eos> king richard ii : rode he on barbary <eos> tell me gentle friend how went he under him <eos> groom : so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground <eos> king richard ii : so proud that bolingbroke was on his back <eos> that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him <eos> would he not stumble <eos> would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back <eos> forgiveness horse <eos> why do i rail on thee since thou created to be awed by man wast born to bear <eos> i was not made a horse and yet i bear a burthen like an ass spurr'd gall'd and tired by jouncing bolingbroke <eos> keeper : fellow give place here is no longer stay <eos> king richard ii : if thou love me 'tis time thou wert away <eos> groom : what my tongue dares not that my heart shall say <eos> keeper : my lord will't please you to fall to <eos> king richard ii : taste of it first as thou art wont to do <eos> keeper : my lord i dare not : sir pierce of exton who lately came from the king commands the contrary <eos> king richard ii : the devil take henry of lancaster and thee <eos> patience is stale and i am weary of it <eos> keeper : help help help <eos> king richard ii : how now <eos> what means death in this rude assault <eos> villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument <eos> go thou and fill another room in hell <eos> that hand shall burn in never-quenching fire that staggers thus my person <eos> exton thy fierce hand hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land <eos> mount mount my soul <eos> thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die <eos> exton : as full of valour as of royal blood : both have i spill'd o would the deed were good <eos> for now the devil that told me i did well says that this deed is chronicled in hell <eos> this dead king to the living king i'll bear take hence the rest and give them burial here <eos> henry bolingbroke : kind uncle york the latest news we hear is that the rebels have consumed with fire our town of cicester in gloucestershire but whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not <eos> welcome my lord what is the news <eos> northumberland : first to thy sacred state wish i all happiness <eos> the next news is i have to london sent the heads of oxford salisbury blunt and kent : the manner of their taking may appear at large discoursed in this paper here <eos> henry bolingbroke : we thank thee gentle percy for thy pains and to thy worth will add right worthy gains <eos> lord fitzwater : my lord i have from oxford sent to london the heads of brocas and sir bennet seely two of the dangerous consorted traitors that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow <eos> henry bolingbroke : thy pains fitzwater shall not be forgot right noble is thy merit well i wot <eos> henry percy : the grand conspirator abbot of westminster with clog of conscience and sour melancholy hath yielded up his body to the grave but here is carlisle living to abide thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride <eos> henry bolingbroke : carlisle this is your doom : choose out some secret place some reverend room more than thou hast and with it joy thy life so as thou livest in peace die free from strife : for though mine enemy thou hast ever been high sparks of honour in thee have i seen <eos> exton : great king within this coffin i present thy buried fear : herein all breathless lies the mightiest of thy greatest enemies richard of bordeaux by me hither brought <eos> henry bolingbroke : exton i thank thee not for thou hast wrought a deed of slander with thy fatal hand upon my head and all this famous land <eos> exton : from your own mouth my lord did i this deed <eos> henry bolingbroke : they love not poison that do poison need nor do i thee : though i did wish him dead i hate the murderer love him murdered <eos> the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour but neither my good word nor princely favour : with cain go wander through shades of night and never show thy head by day nor light <eos> lords i protest my soul is full of woe that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow : come mourn with me for that i do lament and put on sullen black incontinent : i'll make a voyage to the holy land to wash this blood off from my guilty hand : march sadly after grace my mournings here in weeping after this untimely bier <eos> sampson : gregory o' my word we'll not carry coals <eos> gregory : no for then we should be colliers <eos> sampson : i mean an we be in choler we'll draw <eos> gregory : ay while you live draw your neck out o' the collar <eos> sampson : i strike quickly being moved <eos> gregory : but thou art not quickly moved to strike <eos> sampson : a dog of the house of montague moves me <eos> gregory : to move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand : therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st away <eos> sampson : a dog of that house shall move me to stand : i will take the wall of any man or maid of montague's <eos> gregory : that shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes to the wall <eos> sampson : true and therefore women being the weaker vessels are ever thrust to the wall : therefore i will push montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall <eos> gregory : the quarrel is between our masters and us their men <eos> sampson : 'tis all one i will show myself a tyrant : when i have fought with the men i will be cruel with the maids and cut off their heads <eos> gregory : the heads of the maids <eos> sampson : ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads take it in what sense thou wilt <eos> gregory : they must take it in sense that feel it <eos> sampson : me they shall feel while i am able to stand : and 'tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh <eos> gregory : 'tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou hadst been poor john <eos> draw thy tool <eos> here comes two of the house of the montagues <eos> sampson : my naked weapon is out : quarrel i will back thee <eos> gregory : how <eos> turn thy back and run <eos> sampson : fear me not <eos> gregory : no marry i fear thee <eos> sampson : let us take the law of our sides let them begin <eos> gregory : i will frown as i pass by and let them take it as they list <eos> sampson : nay as they dare <eos> i will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them if they bear it <eos> abraham : do you bite your thumb at us sir <eos> sampson : i do bite my thumb sir <eos> abraham : do you bite your thumb at us sir <eos> sampson : gregory : no <eos> sampson : no sir i do not bite my thumb at you sir but i bite my thumb sir <eos> gregory : do you quarrel sir <eos> abraham : quarrel sir <eos> no sir <eos> sampson : if you do sir i am for you : i serve as good a man as you <eos> abraham : no better <eos> sampson : well sir <eos> gregory : say 'better :' here comes one of my master's kinsmen <eos> sampson : yes better sir <eos> abraham : you lie <eos> sampson : draw if you be men <eos> gregory remember thy swashing blow <eos> benvolio : part fools <eos> put up your swords you know not what you do <eos> tybalt : what art thou drawn among these heartless hinds <eos> turn thee benvolio look upon thy death <eos> benvolio : i do but keep the peace : put up thy sword or manage it to part these men with me <eos> tybalt : what drawn and talk of peace <eos> i hate the word as i hate hell all montagues and thee : have at thee coward <eos> first citizen : clubs bills and partisans <eos> strike <eos> beat them down <eos> down with the capulets <eos> down with the montagues <eos> capulet : what noise is this <eos> give me my long sword ho <eos> lady capulet : a crutch a crutch <eos> why call you for a sword <eos> capulet : my sword i say <eos> old montague is come and flourishes his blade in spite of me <eos> montague : thou villain capulet <eos>hold me not let me go <eos> lady montague : thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe <eos> prince : rebellious subjects enemies to peace profaners of this neighbour-stained steel <eos> will they not hear <eos> what ho <eos> you men you beasts that quench the fire of your pernicious rage with purple fountains issuing from your veins on pain of torture from those bloody hands throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground and hear the sentence of your moved prince <eos> three civil brawls bred of an airy word by thee old capulet and montague have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets and made verona's ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partisans in hands as old canker'd with peace to part your canker'd hate : if ever you disturb our streets again your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace <eos> for this time all the rest depart away : you capulet shall go along with me : and montague come you this afternoon to know our further pleasure in this case to old free-town our common judgment-place <eos> once more on pain of death all men depart <eos> montague : who set this ancient quarrel new abroach <eos> speak nephew were you by when it began <eos> benvolio : here were the servants of your adversary and yours close fighting ere i did approach : i drew to part them : in the instant came the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared which as he breathed defiance to my ears he swung about his head and cut the winds who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn : while we were interchanging thrusts and blows came more and more and fought on part and part till the prince came who parted either part <eos> lady montague : o where is romeo <eos> saw you him to-day <eos> right glad i am he was not at this fray <eos> benvolio : madam an hour before the worshipp'd sun peer'd forth the golden window of the east a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the city's side so early walking did i see your son : towards him i made but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood : i measuring his affections by my own that most are busied when they're most alone pursued my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me <eos> montague : many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew <eos> adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the all-cheering sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora's bed away from the light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night : black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove <eos> benvolio : my noble uncle do you know the cause <eos> montague : i neither know it nor can learn of him <eos> benvolio : have you importuned him by any means <eos> montague : both by myself and many other friends : but he his own affections' counsellor is to himself <eos>i will not say how true <eos> but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun <eos> could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow <eos> we would as willingly give cure as know <eos> benvolio : see where he comes : so please you step aside i'll know his grievance or be much denied <eos> montague : i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift <eos> come madam let's away <eos> benvolio : good-morrow cousin <eos> romeo : is the day so young <eos> benvolio : but new struck nine <eos> romeo : ay me <eos> sad hours seem long <eos> was that my father that went hence so fast <eos> benvolio : it was <eos> what sadness lengthens romeo's hours <eos> romeo : not having that which having makes them short <eos> benvolio : in love <eos> romeo : out <eos> benvolio : of love <eos> romeo : out of her favour where i am in love <eos> benvolio : alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof <eos> romeo : alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will <eos> where shall we dine <eos> o me <eos> what fray was here <eos> yet tell me not for i have heard it all <eos> here's much to do with hate but more with love <eos> why then o brawling love <eos> o loving hate <eos> o any thing of nothing first create <eos> o heavy lightness <eos> serious vanity <eos> mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms <eos> feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health <eos> still-waking sleep that is not what it is <eos> this love feel i that feel no love in this <eos> dost thou not laugh <eos> benvolio : no coz i rather weep <eos> romeo : good heart at what <eos> benvolio : at thy good heart's oppression <eos> romeo : why such is love's transgression <eos> griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine : this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own <eos> love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears : what is it else <eos> a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet <eos> farewell my coz <eos> benvolio : soft <eos> i will go along an if you leave me so you do me wrong <eos> romeo : tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo he's some other where <eos> benvolio : tell me in sadness who is that you love <eos> romeo : what shall i groan and tell thee <eos> benvolio : groan <eos> why no <eos> but sadly tell me who <eos> romeo : bid a sick man in sadness make his will : ah word ill urged to one that is so ill <eos> in sadness cousin i do love a woman <eos> benvolio : i aim'd so near when i supposed you loved <eos> romeo : a right good mark-man <eos> and she's fair i love <eos> benvolio : a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit <eos> romeo : well in that hit you miss : she'll not be hit with cupid's arrow she hath dian's wit and in strong proof of chastity well arm'd from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd <eos> she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold : o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store <eos> benvolio : then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste <eos> romeo : she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity <eos> she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair : she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now <eos> benvolio : be ruled by me forget to think of her <eos> romeo : o teach me how i should forget to think <eos> benvolio : by giving liberty unto thine eyes examine other beauties <eos> romeo : 'tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more : these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows being black put us in mind they hide the fair he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost : show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass'd that passing fair <eos> farewell : thou canst not teach me to forget <eos> benvolio : i'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt <eos> capulet : but montague is bound as well as i in penalty alike and 'tis not hard i think for men so old as we to keep the peace <eos> paris : of honourable reckoning are you both and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long <eos> but now my lord what say you to my suit <eos> capulet : but saying o'er what i have said before : my child is yet a stranger in the world she hath not seen the change of fourteen years let two more summers wither in their pride ere we may think her ripe to be a bride <eos> paris : younger than she are happy mothers made <eos> capulet : and too soon marr'd are those so early made <eos> the earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she she is the hopeful lady of my earth : but woo her gentle paris get her heart my will to her consent is but a part an she agree within her scope of choice lies my consent and fair according voice <eos> this night i hold an old accustom'd feast whereto i have invited many a guest such as i love and you among the store one more most welcome makes my number more <eos> at my poor house look to behold this night earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light : such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well-apparell'd april on the heel of limping winter treads even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night inherit at my house hear all all see and like her most whose merit most shall be : which on more view of many mine being one may stand in number though in reckoning none come go with me <eos> go sirrah trudge about through fair verona find those persons out whose names are written there and to them say my house and welcome on their pleasure stay <eos> servant : find them out whose names are written here <eos> it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ <eos> i must to the learned <eos> <eos>in good time <eos> benvolio : tut man one fire burns out another's burning one pain is lessen'd by another's anguish turn giddy and be holp by backward turning one desperate grief cures with another's languish : take thou some new infection to thy eye and the rank poison of the old will die <eos> romeo : your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that <eos> benvolio : for what i pray thee <eos> romeo : for your broken shin <eos> benvolio : why romeo art thou mad <eos> romeo : not mad but bound more than a mad-man is shut up in prison kept without my food whipp'd and tormented and <eos>god-den good fellow <eos> servant : god gi' god-den <eos> i pray sir can you read <eos> romeo : ay mine own fortune in my misery <eos> servant : perhaps you have learned it without book : but i pray can you read any thing you see <eos> romeo : ay if i know the letters and the language <eos> servant : ye say honestly : rest you merry <eos> romeo : stay fellow i can read <eos> 'signior martino and his wife and daughters county anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of vitravio signior placentio and his lovely nieces mercutio and his brother valentine mine uncle capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece rosaline livia signior valentio and his cousin tybalt lucio and the lively helena <eos>' a fair assembly : whither should they come <eos> servant : up <eos> romeo : whither <eos> servant : to supper to our house <eos> romeo : whose house <eos> servant : my master's <eos> romeo : indeed i should have ask'd you that before <eos> servant : now i'll tell you without asking : my master is the great rich capulet and if you be not of the house of montagues i pray come and crush a cup of wine <eos> rest you merry <eos> benvolio : at this same ancient feast of capulet's sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest with all the admired beauties of verona : go thither and with unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show and i will make thee think thy swan a crow <eos> romeo : when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires and these who often drown'd could never die transparent heretics be burnt for liars <eos> one fairer than my love <eos> the all-seeing sun ne'er saw her match since first the world begun <eos> benvolio : tut you saw her fair none else being by herself poised with herself in either eye : but in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd your lady's love against some other maid that i will show you shining at this feast and she shall scant show well that now shows best <eos> romeo : i'll go along no such sight to be shown but to rejoice in splendor of mine own <eos> lady capulet : nurse where's my daughter <eos> call her forth to me <eos> nurse : now by my maidenhead at twelve year old i bade her come <eos> what lamb <eos> what ladybird <eos> god forbid <eos> where's this girl <eos> what juliet <eos> juliet : how now <eos> who calls <eos> nurse : your mother <eos> juliet : madam i am here <eos> what is your will <eos> lady capulet : this is the matter : <eos>nurse give leave awhile we must talk in secret : <eos>nurse come back again i have remember'd me thou's hear our counsel <eos> thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age <eos> nurse : faith i can tell her age unto an hour <eos> lady capulet : she's not fourteen <eos> nurse : i'll lay fourteen of my teeth <eos> and yet to my teeth be it spoken i have but four <eos> she is not fourteen <eos> how long is it now to lammas-tide <eos> lady capulet : a fortnight and odd days <eos> nurse : even or odd of all days in the year come lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen <eos> susan and she <eos>god rest all christian souls <eos> <eos> were of an age : well susan is with god she was too good for me : but as i said on lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen that shall she marry i remember it well <eos> 'tis since the earthquake now eleven years and she was wean'd <eos>i never shall forget it <eos> of all the days of the year upon that day : for i had then laid wormwood to my dug sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall my lord and you were then at mantua : <eos> nay i do bear a brain : <eos>but as i said when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug <eos> shake quoth the dove-house : 'twas no need i trow to bid me trudge : and since that time it is eleven years for then she could stand alone nay by the rood she could have run and waddled all about for even the day before she broke her brow : and then my husband <eos>god be with his soul <eos> a' was a merry man <eos>took up the child : 'yea' quoth he 'dost thou fall upon thy face <eos> thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit wilt thou not jule <eos>' and by my holidame the pretty wretch left crying and said 'ay <eos>' to see now how a jest shall come about <eos> i warrant an i should live a thousand years i never should forget it : 'wilt thou not jule <eos>' quoth he and pretty fool it stinted and said 'ay <eos>' lady capulet : enough of this i pray thee hold thy peace <eos> nurse : yes madam : yet i cannot choose but laugh to think it should leave crying and say 'ay <eos>' and yet i warrant it had upon its brow a bump as big as a young cockerel's stone a parlous knock and it cried bitterly : 'yea' quoth my husband'fall'st upon thy face <eos> thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age wilt thou not jule <eos>' it stinted and said 'ay <eos>' juliet : and stint thou too i pray thee nurse say i <eos> nurse : peace i have done <eos> god mark thee to his grace <eos> thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed : an i might live to see thee married once i have my wish <eos> lady capulet : marry that 'marry' is the very theme i came to talk of <eos> tell me daughter juliet how stands your disposition to be married <eos> juliet : it is an honour that i dream not of <eos> nurse : an honour <eos> were not i thine only nurse i would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat <eos> lady capulet : well think of marriage now younger than you here in verona ladies of esteem are made already mothers : by my count i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid <eos> thus then in brief : the valiant paris seeks you for his love <eos> nurse : a man young lady <eos> lady such a man as all the world <eos>why he's a man of wax <eos> lady capulet : verona's summer hath not such a flower <eos> nurse : nay he's a flower in faith a very flower <eos> lady capulet : what say you <eos> can you love the gentleman <eos> this night you shall behold him at our feast read o'er the volume of young paris' face and find delight writ there with beauty's pen examine every married lineament and see how one another lends content and what obscured in this fair volume lies find written in the margent of his eyes <eos> this precious book of love this unbound lover to beautify him only lacks a cover : the fish lives in the sea and 'tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide : that book in many's eyes doth share the glory that in gold clasps locks in the golden story so shall you share all that he doth possess by having him making yourself no less <eos> nurse : no less <eos> nay bigger women grow by men <eos> lady capulet : speak briefly can you like of paris' love <eos> juliet : i'll look to like if looking liking move : but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly <eos> servant : madam the guests are come supper served up you called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in the pantry and every thing in extremity <eos> i must hence to wait i beseech you follow straight <eos> lady capulet : we follow thee <eos> juliet the county stays <eos> nurse : go girl seek happy nights to happy days <eos> romeo : what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse <eos> or shall we on without a apology <eos> benvolio : the date is out of such prolixity : we'll have no cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf bearing a tartar's painted bow of lath scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper nor no without-book prologue faintly spoke after the prompter for our entrance : but let them measure us by what they will we'll measure them a measure and be gone <eos> romeo : give me a torch : i am not for this ambling being but heavy i will bear the light <eos> mercutio : nay gentle romeo we must have you dance <eos> romeo : not i believe me : you have dancing shoes with nimble soles : i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move <eos> mercutio : you are a lover borrow cupid's wings and soar with them above a common bound <eos> romeo : i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe : under love's heavy burden do i sink <eos> mercutio : and to sink in it should you burden love too great oppression for a tender thing <eos> romeo : is love a tender thing <eos> it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn <eos> mercutio : if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down <eos> give me a case to put my visage in : a visor for a visor <eos> what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities <eos> here are the beetle brows shall blush for me <eos> benvolio : come knock and enter and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs <eos> romeo : a torch for me : let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase i'll be a candle-holder and look on <eos> the game was ne'er so fair and i am done <eos> mercutio : tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word : if thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire of this sir-reverence love wherein thou stick'st up to the ears <eos> come we burn daylight ho <eos> romeo : nay that's not so <eos> mercutio : i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day <eos> take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits <eos> romeo : and we mean well in going to this mask but 'tis no wit to go <eos> mercutio : why may one ask <eos> romeo : i dream'd a dream to-night <eos> mercutio : and so did i <eos> romeo : well what was yours <eos> mercutio : that dreamers often lie <eos> romeo : in bed asleep while they do dream things true <eos> mercutio : o then i see queen mab hath been with you <eos> she is the fairies' midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart men's noses as they lie asleep her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers the traces of the smallest spider's web the collars of the moonshine's watery beams her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat not so big as a round little worm prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazel-nut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers <eos> and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers' brains and then they dream of love o'er courtiers' knees that dream on court'sies straight o'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees o'er ladies ' lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are : sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice : sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five-fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again <eos> this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes : this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage : this is she <eos> romeo : peace peace mercutio peace <eos> thou talk'st of nothing <eos> mercutio : true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being anger'd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dew-dropping south <eos> benvolio : this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late <eos> romeo : i fear too early : for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night's revels and expire the term of a despised life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death <eos> but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail <eos> on lusty gentlemen <eos> benvolio : strike drum <eos> first servant : where's potpan that he helps not to take away <eos> he shift a trencher <eos> he scrape a trencher <eos> second servant : when good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands and they unwashed too 'tis a foul thing <eos> first servant : away with the joint-stools remove the court-cupboard look to the plate <eos> good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell <eos> antony and potpan <eos> second servant : ay boy ready <eos> first servant : you are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber <eos> second servant : we cannot be here and there too <eos> cheerly boys be brisk awhile and the longer liver take all <eos> capulet : welcome gentlemen <eos> ladies that have their toes unplagued with corns will have a bout with you <eos> ah ha my mistresses <eos> which of you all will now deny to dance <eos> she that makes dainty she i'll swear hath corns am i come near ye now <eos> welcome gentlemen <eos> i have seen the day that i have worn a visor and could tell a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear such as would please : 'tis gone 'tis gone 'tis gone : you are welcome gentlemen <eos> come musicians play <eos> a hall a hall <eos> give room <eos> and foot it girls <eos> more light you knaves and turn the tables up and quench the fire the room is grown too hot <eos> ah sirrah this unlook'd-for sport comes well <eos> nay sit nay sit good cousin capulet for you and i are past our dancing days : how long is't now since last yourself and i were in a mask <eos> second capulet : by'r lady thirty years <eos> capulet : what man <eos> 'tis not so much 'tis not so much : 'tis since the nuptials of lucentio come pentecost as quickly as it will some five and twenty years and then we mask'd <eos> second capulet : 'tis more 'tis more his son is elder sir his son is thirty <eos> capulet : will you tell me that <eos> his son was but a ward two years ago <eos> romeo : servant : i know not sir <eos> romeo : o she doth teach the torches to burn bright <eos> it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an ethiope's ear beauty too rich for use for earth too dear <eos> so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows <eos> the measure done i'll watch her place of stand and touching hers make blessed my rude hand <eos> did my heart love till now <eos> forswear it sight <eos> for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night <eos> tybalt : this by his voice should be a montague <eos> fetch me my rapier boy <eos> what dares the slave come hither cover'd with an antic face to fleer and scorn at our solemnity <eos> now by the stock and honour of my kin to strike him dead i hold it not a sin <eos> capulet : why how now kinsman <eos> wherefore storm you so <eos> tybalt : uncle this is a montague our foe a villain that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night <eos> capulet : young romeo is it <eos> tybalt : 'tis he that villain romeo <eos> capulet : content thee gentle coz let him alone he bears him like a portly gentleman and to say truth verona brags of him to be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth : i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement : therefore be patient take no note of him : it is my will the which if thou respect show a fair presence and put off these frowns and ill-beseeming semblance for a feast <eos> tybalt : it fits when such a villain is a guest : i'll not endure him <eos> capulet : he shall be endured : what goodman boy <eos> i say he shall : go to am i the master here or you <eos> go to <eos> you'll not endure him <eos> god shall mend my soul <eos> you'll make a mutiny among my guests <eos> you will set cock-a-hoop <eos> you'll be the man <eos> tybalt : why uncle 'tis a shame <eos> capulet : go to go to you are a saucy boy : is't so indeed <eos> this trick may chance to scathe you i know what : you must contrary me <eos> marry 'tis time <eos> well said my hearts <eos> you are a princox go : be quiet or <eos>more light more light <eos> for shame <eos> i'll make you quiet <eos> what cheerly my hearts <eos> tybalt : patience perforce with wilful choler meeting makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting <eos> i will withdraw : but this intrusion shall now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall <eos> romeo : juliet : good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss <eos> romeo : have not saints lips and holy palmers too <eos> juliet : ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer <eos> romeo : o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair <eos> juliet : saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake <eos> romeo : then move not while my prayer's effect i take <eos> thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged <eos> juliet : then have my lips the sin that they have took <eos> romeo : sin from thy lips <eos> o trespass sweetly urged <eos> give me my sin again <eos> juliet : you kiss by the book <eos> nurse : madam your mother craves a word with you <eos> romeo : what is her mother <eos> nurse : marry bachelor her mother is the lady of the house and a good lady and a wise and virtuous i nursed her daughter that you talk'd withal i tell you he that can lay hold of her shall have the chinks <eos> romeo : is she a capulet <eos> o dear account <eos> my life is my foe's debt <eos> benvolio : away begone the sport is at the best <eos> romeo : ay so i fear the more is my unrest <eos> capulet : nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone we have a trifling foolish banquet towards <eos> is it e'en so <eos> why then i thank you all i thank you honest gentlemen good night <eos> more torches here <eos> come on then let's to bed <eos> ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late : i'll to my rest <eos> juliet : come hither nurse <eos> what is yond gentleman <eos> nurse : the son and heir of old tiberio <eos> juliet : what's he that now is going out of door <eos> nurse : marry that i think be young petrucio <eos> juliet : what's he that follows there that would not dance <eos> nurse : i know not <eos> juliet : go ask his name : if he be married <eos> my grave is like to be my wedding bed <eos> nurse : his name is romeo and a montague the only son of your great enemy <eos> juliet : my only love sprung from my only hate <eos> too early seen unknown and known too late <eos> prodigious birth of love it is to me that i must love a loathed enemy <eos> nurse : what's this <eos> what's this <eos> juliet : a rhyme i learn'd even now of one i danced withal <eos> nurse : anon anon <eos> come let's away the strangers all are gone <eos> chorus : now old desire doth in his death-bed lie and young affection gapes to be his heir that fair for which love groan'd for and would die with tender juliet match'd is now not fair <eos> now romeo is beloved and loves again alike betwitched by the charm of looks but to his foe supposed he must complain and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks : being held a foe he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear and she as much in love her means much less to meet her new-beloved any where : but passion lends them power time means to meet tempering extremities with extreme sweet <eos> romeo : can i go forward when my heart is here <eos> turn back dull earth and find thy centre out <eos> benvolio : romeo <eos> my cousin romeo <eos> mercutio : he is wise and on my lie hath stol'n him home to bed <eos> benvolio : he ran this way and leap'd this orchard wall : call good mercutio <eos> mercutio : nay i'll conjure too <eos> romeo <eos> humours <eos> madman <eos> passion <eos> lover <eos> appear thou in the likeness of a sigh : speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied cry but 'ay me <eos>' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove' speak to my gossip venus one fair word one nick-name for her purblind son and heir young adam cupid he that shot so trim when king cophetua loved the beggar-maid <eos> he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not the ape is dead and i must conjure him <eos> i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes by her high forehead and her scarlet lip by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh and the demesnes that there adjacent lie that in thy likeness thou appear to us <eos> benvolio : and if he hear thee thou wilt anger him <eos> mercutio : this cannot anger him : 'twould anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress' circle of some strange nature letting it there stand till she had laid it and conjured it down that were some spite : my invocation is fair and honest and in his mistress' name i conjure only but to raise up him <eos> benvolio : come he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night : blind is his love and best befits the dark <eos> mercutio : if love be blind love cannot hit the mark <eos> now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone <eos> romeo that she were o that she were an open et caetera thou a poperin pear <eos> romeo good night : i'll to my truckle-bed this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep : come shall we go <eos> benvolio : go then for 'tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found <eos> romeo : he jests at scars that never felt a wound <eos> but soft <eos> what light through yonder window breaks <eos> it is the east and juliet is the sun <eos> arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she : be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off <eos> it is my lady o it is my love <eos> o that she knew she were <eos> she speaks yet she says nothing : what of that <eos> her eye discourses i will answer it <eos> i am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks : two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return <eos> what if her eyes were there they in her head <eos> the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night <eos> see how she leans her cheek upon her hand <eos> o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek <eos> juliet : ay me <eos> romeo : she speaks : o speak again bright angel <eos> for thou art as glorious to this night being o'er my head as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the white-upturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air <eos> juliet : o romeo romeo <eos> wherefore art thou romeo <eos> deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and i'll no longer be a capulet <eos> romeo : juliet : 'tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague <eos> what's montague <eos> it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man <eos> o be some other name <eos> what's in a name <eos> that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet so romeo would were he not romeo call'd retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title <eos> romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself <eos> romeo : i take thee at thy word : call me but love and i'll be new baptized henceforth i never will be romeo <eos> juliet : what man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night so stumblest on my counsel <eos> romeo : by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am : my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee had i it written i would tear the word <eos> juliet : my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of that tongue's utterance yet i know the sound : art thou not romeo and a montague <eos> romeo : neither fair saint if either thee dislike <eos> juliet : how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore <eos> the orchard walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here <eos> romeo : with love's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me <eos> juliet : if they do see thee they will murder thee <eos> romeo : alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords : look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity <eos> juliet : i would not for the world they saw thee here <eos> romeo : i have night's cloak to hide me from their sight and but thou love me let them find me here : my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love <eos> juliet : by whose direction found'st thou out this place <eos> romeo : by love who first did prompt me to inquire he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes <eos> i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea i would adventure for such merchandise <eos> juliet : thou know'st the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke : but farewell compliment <eos> dost thou love me <eos> i know thou wilt say 'ay' and i will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st thou mayst prove false at lovers' perjuries then say jove laughs <eos> o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully : or if thou think'st i am too quickly won i'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay so thou wilt woo but else not for the world <eos> in truth fair montague i am too fond and therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light : but trust me gentleman i'll prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange <eos> i should have been more strange i must confess but that thou overheard'st ere i was ware my true love's passion : therefore pardon me and not impute this yielding to light love which the dark night hath so discovered <eos> romeo : lady by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops <eos> juliet : o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable <eos> romeo : what shall i swear by <eos> juliet : do not swear at all or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and i'll believe thee <eos> romeo : if my heart's dear love <eos> juliet : well do not swear : although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract to-night : it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say 'it lightens <eos>' sweet good night <eos> this bud of love by summer's ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet <eos> good night good night <eos> as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast <eos> romeo : o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied <eos> juliet : what satisfaction canst thou have to-night <eos> romeo : the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine <eos> juliet : i gave thee mine before thou didst request it : and yet i would it were to give again <eos> romeo : wouldst thou withdraw it <eos> for what purpose love <eos> juliet : but to be frank and give it thee again <eos> and yet i wish but for the thing i have : my bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep the more i give to thee the more i have for both are infinite <eos> i hear some noise within dear love adieu <eos> anon good nurse <eos> sweet montague be true <eos> stay but a little i will come again <eos> romeo : o blessed blessed night <eos> i am afeard <eos> being in night all this is but a dream too flattering-sweet to be substantial <eos> juliet : three words dear romeo and good night indeed <eos> if that thy bent of love be honourable thy purpose marriage send me word to-morrow by one that i'll procure to come to thee where and what time thou wilt perform the rite and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world <eos> nurse : juliet : i come anon <eos> <eos>but if thou mean'st not well i do beseech thee <eos> nurse : juliet : by and by i come : <eos> to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief : to-morrow will i send <eos> romeo : so thrive my soul <eos> juliet : a thousand times good night <eos> romeo : a thousand times the worse to want thy light <eos> love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks <eos> juliet : hist <eos> romeo hist <eos> o for a falconer's voice to lure this tassel-gentle back again <eos> bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud else would i tear the cave where echo lies and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeo's name <eos> romeo : it is my soul that calls upon my name : how silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night like softest music to attending ears <eos> juliet : romeo <eos> romeo : my dear <eos> juliet : at what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee <eos> romeo : at the hour of nine <eos> juliet : i will not fail : 'tis twenty years till then <eos> i have forgot why i did call thee back <eos> romeo : let me stand here till thou remember it <eos> juliet : i shall forget to have thee still stand there remembering how i love thy company <eos> romeo : and i'll still stay to have thee still forget forgetting any other home but this <eos> juliet : 'tis almost morning i would have thee gone : and yet no further than a wanton's bird who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so loving-jealous of his liberty <eos> romeo : i would i were thy bird <eos> juliet : sweet so would i : yet i should kill thee with much cherishing <eos> good night good night <eos> parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow <eos> romeo : sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast <eos> would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest <eos> hence will i to my ghostly father's cell his help to crave and my dear hap to tell <eos> friar laurence : the grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels : now ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry i must up-fill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers <eos> the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb what is her burying grave that is her womb and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different <eos> o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs plants stones and their true qualities : for nought so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse : virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometimes by action dignified <eos> within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power : for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart <eos> two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant <eos> romeo : good morrow father <eos> friar laurence : benedicite <eos> what early tongue so sweet saluteth me <eos> young son it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed : care keeps his watch in every old man's eye and where care lodges sleep will never lie but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign : therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art up-roused by some distemperature or if not so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not been in bed to-night <eos> romeo : that last is true the sweeter rest was mine <eos> friar laurence : god pardon sin <eos> wast thou with rosaline <eos> romeo : with rosaline my ghostly father <eos> no i have forgot that name and that name's woe <eos> friar laurence : that's my good son : but where hast thou been then <eos> romeo : i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again <eos> i have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me that's by me wounded : both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies : i bear no hatred blessed man for lo my intercession likewise steads my foe <eos> friar laurence : be plain good son and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift <eos> romeo : then plainly know my heart's dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet : as mine on hers so hers is set on mine and all combined save what thou must combine by holy marriage : when and where and how we met we woo'd and made exchange of vow i'll tell thee as we pass but this i pray that thou consent to marry us to-day <eos> friar laurence : holy saint francis what a change is here <eos> is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken <eos> young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes <eos> jesu maria what a deal of brine hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline <eos> how much salt water thrown away in waste to season love that of it doth not taste <eos> the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet : if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine thou and these woes were all for rosaline : and art thou changed <eos> pronounce this sentence then women may fall when there's no strength in men <eos> romeo : thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline <eos> friar laurence : for doting not for loving pupil mine <eos> romeo : and bad'st me bury love <eos> friar laurence : not in a grave to lay one in another out to have <eos> romeo : i pray thee chide not she whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow the other did not so <eos> friar laurence : o she knew well thy love did read by rote and could not spell <eos> but come young waverer come go with me in one respect i'll thy assistant be for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households' rancour to pure love <eos> romeo : o let us hence i stand on sudden haste <eos> friar laurence : wisely and slow they stumble that run fast <eos> mercutio : where the devil should this romeo be <eos> came he not home to-night <eos> benvolio : not to his father's i spoke with his man <eos> mercutio : ah that same pale hard-hearted wench that rosaline <eos> torments him so that he will sure run mad <eos> benvolio : tybalt the kinsman of old capulet hath sent a letter to his father's house <eos> mercutio : a challenge on my life <eos> benvolio : romeo will answer it <eos> mercutio : any man that can write may answer a letter <eos> benvolio : nay he will answer the letter's master how he dares being dared <eos> mercutio : alas poor romeo <eos> he is already dead stabbed with a white wench's black eye shot through the ear with a love-song the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft : and is he a man to encounter tybalt <eos> benvolio : why what is tybalt <eos> mercutio : more than prince of cats i can tell you <eos> o he is the courageous captain of compliments <eos> he fights as you sing prick-song keeps time distance and proportion rests me his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause : ah the immortal passado <eos> the punto reverso <eos> the hai <eos> benvolio : the what <eos> mercutio : the pox of such antic lisping affecting fantasticoes these new tuners of accents <eos> 'by jesu a very good blade <eos> a very tall man <eos> a very good whore <eos>' why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies these fashion-mongers these perdona-mi's who stand so much on the new form that they cannot at ease on the old bench <eos> o their bones their bones <eos> benvolio : here comes romeo here comes romeo <eos> mercutio : without his roe like a dried herring : flesh flesh how art thou fishified <eos> now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in : laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench marry she had a better love to be-rhyme her dido a dowdy cleopatra a gipsy helen and hero hildings and harlots thisbe a grey eye or so but not to the purpose <eos> signior romeo bon jour <eos> there's a french salutation to your french slop <eos> you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night <eos> romeo : good morrow to you both <eos> what counterfeit did i give you <eos> mercutio : the ship sir the slip can you not conceive <eos> romeo : pardon good mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy <eos> mercutio : that's as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams <eos> romeo : meaning to court'sy <eos> mercutio : thou hast most kindly hit it <eos> romeo : a most courteous exposition <eos> mercutio : nay i am the very pink of courtesy <eos> romeo : pink for flower <eos> mercutio : right <eos> romeo : why then is my pump well flowered <eos> mercutio : well said : follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular <eos> romeo : o single-soled jest solely singular for the singleness <eos> mercutio : come between us good benvolio my wits faint <eos> romeo : switch and spurs switch and spurs or i'll cry a match <eos> mercutio : nay if thy wits run the wild-goose chase i have done for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than i am sure i have in my whole five : was i with you there for the goose <eos> romeo : thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast not there for the goose <eos> mercutio : i will bite thee by the ear for that jest <eos> romeo : nay good goose bite not <eos> mercutio : thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce <eos> romeo : and is it not well served in to a sweet goose <eos> mercutio : o here's a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad <eos> romeo : i stretch it out for that word 'broad' which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose <eos> mercutio : why is not this better now than groaning for love <eos> now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature : for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole <eos> benvolio : stop there stop there <eos> mercutio : thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair <eos> benvolio : thou wouldst else have made thy tale large <eos> mercutio : o thou art deceived i would have made it short : for i was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer <eos> romeo : here's goodly gear <eos> mercutio : a sail a sail <eos> benvolio : two two a shirt and a smock <eos> nurse : peter <eos> peter : anon <eos> nurse : my fan peter <eos> mercutio : good peter to hide her face for her fan's the fairer face <eos> nurse : god ye good morrow gentlemen <eos> mercutio : god ye good den fair gentlewoman <eos> nurse : is it good den <eos> mercutio : 'tis no less i tell you for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon <eos> nurse : out upon you <eos> what a man are you <eos> romeo : one gentlewoman that god hath made for himself to mar <eos> nurse : by my troth it is well said 'for himself to mar' quoth a' <eos> gentlemen can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo <eos> romeo : i can tell you but young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him : i am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse <eos> nurse : you say well <eos> mercutio : yea is the worst well <eos> very well took i' faith wisely wisely <eos> nurse : if you be he sir i desire some confidence with you <eos> benvolio : she will indite him to some supper <eos> mercutio : a bawd a bawd a bawd <eos> so ho <eos> romeo : what hast thou found <eos> mercutio : no hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent <eos> an old hare hoar and an old hare hoar is very good meat in lent but a hare that is hoar is too much for a score when it hoars ere it be spent <eos> romeo will you come to your father's <eos> we'll to dinner thither <eos> romeo : i will follow you <eos> mercutio : farewell ancient lady farewell 'lady lady lady <eos>' nurse : marry farewell <eos> i pray you sir what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery <eos> romeo : a gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month <eos> nurse : an a' speak any thing against me i'll take him down an a' were lustier than he is and twenty such jacks and if i cannot i'll find those that shall <eos> scurvy knave <eos> i am none of his flirt-gills i am none of his skains-mates <eos> and thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure <eos> peter : i saw no man use you a pleasure if i had my weapon should quickly have been out i warrant you : i dare draw as soon as another man if i see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side <eos> nurse : now afore god i am so vexed that every part about me quivers <eos> scurvy knave <eos> pray you sir a word : and as i told you my young lady bade me inquire you out what she bade me say i will keep to myself : but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behavior as they say : for the gentlewoman is young and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing <eos> romeo : nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress <eos> i protest unto thee <eos> nurse : good heart and i' faith i will tell her as much : lord lord she will be a joyful woman <eos> romeo : what wilt thou tell her nurse <eos> thou dost not mark me <eos> nurse : i will tell her sir that you do protest which as i take it is a gentlemanlike offer <eos> romeo : bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon and there she shall at friar laurence' cell be shrived and married <eos> here is for thy pains <eos> nurse : no truly sir not a penny <eos> romeo : go to i say you shall <eos> nurse : this afternoon sir <eos> well she shall be there <eos> romeo : and stay good nurse behind the abbey wall : within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair which to the high top-gallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night <eos> farewell be trusty and i'll quit thy pains : farewell commend me to thy mistress <eos> nurse : now god in heaven bless thee <eos> hark you sir <eos> romeo : what say'st thou my dear nurse <eos> nurse : is your man secret <eos> did you ne'er hear say two may keep counsel putting one away <eos> romeo : i warrant thee my man's as true as steel <eos> nurse : well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady <eos>lord lord <eos> when 'twas a little prating thing : <eos>o there is a nobleman in town one paris that would fain lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lief see a toad a very toad as see him <eos> i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man but i'll warrant you when i say so she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world <eos> doth not rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter <eos> romeo : ay nurse what of that <eos> both with an r <eos> nurse : ah <eos> mocker <eos> that's the dog's name r is for the <eos>no i know it begins with some other letter : <eos>and she hath the prettiest sententious of it of you and rosemary that it would do you good to hear it <eos> romeo : commend me to thy lady <eos> nurse : ay a thousand times <eos> peter <eos> peter : anon <eos> nurse : peter take my fan and go before and apace <eos> juliet : the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse in half an hour she promised to return <eos> perchance she cannot meet him : that's not so <eos> o she is lame <eos> love's heralds should be thoughts which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams driving back shadows over louring hills : therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings <eos> now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey and from nine till twelve is three long hours yet she is not come <eos> had she affections and warm youthful blood she would be as swift in motion as a ball my words would bandy her to my sweet love and his to me : but old folks many feign as they were dead unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead <eos> o god she comes <eos> o honey nurse what news <eos> hast thou met with him <eos> send thy man away <eos> nurse : peter stay at the gate <eos> juliet : now good sweet nurse <eos>o lord why look'st thou sad <eos> though news be sad yet tell them merrily if good thou shamest the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face <eos> nurse : i am a-weary give me leave awhile : fie how my bones ache <eos> what a jaunt have i had <eos> juliet : i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news : nay come i pray thee speak good good nurse speak <eos> nurse : jesu what haste <eos> can you not stay awhile <eos> do you not see that i am out of breath <eos> juliet : how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath <eos> the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse <eos> is thy news good or bad <eos> answer to that say either and i'll stay the circumstance : let me be satisfied is't good or bad <eos> nurse : well you have made a simple choice you know not how to choose a man : romeo <eos> no not he though his face be better than any man's yet his leg excels all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body though they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare : he is not the flower of courtesy but i'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb <eos> go thy ways wench serve god <eos> what have you dined at home <eos> juliet : no no : but all this did i know before <eos> what says he of our marriage <eos> what of that <eos> nurse : lord how my head aches <eos> what a head have i <eos> it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces <eos> my back o' t' other side <eos>o my back my back <eos> beshrew your heart for sending me about to catch my death with jaunting up and down <eos> juliet : i' faith i am sorry that thou art not well <eos> sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love <eos> nurse : your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and i warrant a virtuous <eos>where is your mother <eos> juliet : where is my mother <eos> why she is within where should she be <eos> how oddly thou repliest <eos> 'your love says like an honest gentleman where is your mother <eos>' nurse : o god's lady dear <eos> are you so hot <eos> marry come up i trow is this the poultice for my aching bones <eos> henceforward do your messages yourself <eos> juliet : here's such a coil <eos> come what says romeo <eos> nurse : have you got leave to go to shrift to-day <eos> juliet : i have <eos> nurse : then hie you hence to friar laurence' cell there stays a husband to make you a wife : now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks they'll be in scarlet straight at any news <eos> hie you to church i must another way to fetch a ladder by the which your love must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark : i am the drudge and toil in your delight but you shall bear the burden soon at night <eos> go i'll to dinner : hie you to the cell <eos> juliet : hie to high fortune <eos> honest nurse farewell <eos> friar laurence : so smile the heavens upon this holy act that after hours with sorrow chide us not <eos> romeo : amen amen <eos> but come what sorrow can it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight : do thou but close our hands with holy words then love-devouring death do what he dare it is enough i may but call her mine <eos> friar laurence : these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die like fire and powder which as they kiss consume : the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite : therefore love moderately long love doth so too swift arrives as tardy as too slow <eos> here comes the lady : o so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint : a lover may bestride the gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall so light is vanity <eos> juliet : good even to my ghostly confessor <eos> friar laurence : romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both <eos> juliet : as much to him else is his thanks too much <eos> romeo : ah juliet if the measure of thy joy be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air and let rich music's tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter <eos> juliet : conceit more rich in matter than in words brags of his substance not of ornament : they are but beggars that can count their worth but my true love is grown to such excess i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth <eos> friar laurence : come come with me and we will make short work for by your leaves you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one <eos> benvolio : i pray thee good mercutio let's retire : the day is hot the capulets abroad and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring <eos> mercutio : thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says 'god send me no need of thee <eos>' and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need <eos> benvolio : am i like such a fellow <eos> mercutio : come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved <eos> benvolio : and what to <eos> mercutio : nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other <eos> thou <eos> why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast : thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes : what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel <eos> thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling : thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun : didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter <eos> with another for tying his new shoes with old riband <eos> and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling <eos> benvolio : an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter <eos> mercutio : the fee-simple <eos> o simple <eos> benvolio : by my head here come the capulets <eos> mercutio : by my heel i care not <eos> tybalt : follow me close for i will speak to them <eos> gentlemen good den : a word with one of you <eos> mercutio : and but one word with one of us <eos> couple it with something make it a word and a blow <eos> tybalt : you shall find me apt enough to that sir an you will give me occasion <eos> mercutio : could you not take some occasion without giving <eos> tybalt : mercutio thou consort'st with romeo <eos> mercutio : consort <eos> what dost thou make us minstrels <eos> an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords : here's my fiddlestick here's that shall make you dance <eos> 'zounds consort <eos> benvolio : we talk here in the public haunt of men : either withdraw unto some private place and reason coldly of your grievances or else depart here all eyes gaze on us <eos> mercutio : men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze i will not budge for no man's pleasure i <eos> tybalt : well peace be with you sir : here comes my man <eos> mercutio : but i'll be hanged sir if he wear your livery : marry go before to field he'll be your follower your worship in that sense may call him 'man <eos>' tybalt : romeo the hate i bear thee can afford no better term than this <eos>thou art a villain <eos> romeo : tybalt the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting : villain am i none therefore farewell i see thou know'st me not <eos> tybalt : boy this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw <eos> romeo : i do protest i never injured thee but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt know the reason of my love : and so good capulet <eos>which name i tender as dearly as my own <eos>be satisfied <eos> mercutio : o calm dishonourable vile submission <eos> alla stoccata carries it away <eos> tybalt you rat-catcher will you walk <eos> tybalt : what wouldst thou have with me <eos> mercutio : good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives that i mean to make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest of the eight <eos> will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears <eos> make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out <eos> tybalt : i am for you <eos> romeo : gentle mercutio put thy rapier up <eos> mercutio : come sir your passado <eos> romeo : draw benvolio beat down their weapons <eos> gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage <eos> tybalt mercutio the prince expressly hath forbidden bandying in verona streets : hold tybalt <eos> good mercutio <eos> mercutio : i am hurt <eos> a plague o' both your houses <eos> i am sped <eos> is he gone and hath nothing <eos> benvolio : what art thou hurt <eos> mercutio : ay ay a scratch a scratch marry 'tis enough <eos> where is my page <eos> go villain fetch a surgeon <eos> romeo : courage man the hurt cannot be much <eos> mercutio : no 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door but 'tis enough'twill serve : ask for me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man <eos> i am peppered i warrant for this world <eos> a plague o' both your houses <eos> 'zounds a dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death <eos> a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic <eos> why the devil came you between us <eos> i was hurt under your arm <eos> romeo : i thought all for the best <eos> mercutio : help me into some house benvolio or i shall faint <eos> a plague o' both your houses <eos> they have made worms' meat of me : i have it and soundly too : your houses <eos> romeo : this gentleman the prince's near ally my very friend hath got his mortal hurt in my behalf my reputation stain'd with tybalt's slander <eos>tybalt that an hour hath been my kinsman <eos> o sweet juliet thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper soften'd valour's steel <eos> benvolio : o romeo romeo brave mercutio's dead <eos> that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds which too untimely here did scorn the earth <eos> romeo : this day's black fate on more days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end <eos> benvolio : here comes the furious tybalt back again <eos> romeo : alive in triumph <eos> and mercutio slain <eos> away to heaven respective lenity and fire-eyed fury be my conduct now <eos> now tybalt take the villain back again that late thou gavest me for mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company : either thou or i or both must go with him <eos> tybalt : thou wretched boy that didst consort him here shalt with him hence <eos> romeo : this shall determine that <eos> benvolio : romeo away be gone <eos> the citizens are up and tybalt slain <eos> stand not amazed : the prince will doom thee death if thou art taken : hence be gone away <eos> romeo : o i am fortune's fool <eos> benvolio : why dost thou stay <eos> first citizen : which way ran he that kill'd mercutio <eos> tybalt that murderer which way ran he <eos> benvolio : there lies that tybalt <eos> first citizen : up sir go with me i charge thee in the princes name obey <eos> prince : where are the vile beginners of this fray <eos> benvolio : o noble prince i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl : there lies the man slain by young romeo that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio <eos> lady capulet : tybalt my cousin <eos> o my brother's child <eos> o prince <eos> o cousin <eos> husband <eos> o the blood is spilt o my dear kinsman <eos> prince as thou art true for blood of ours shed blood of montague <eos> o cousin cousin <eos> prince : benvolio who began this bloody fray <eos> benvolio : tybalt here slain whom romeo's hand did slay romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urged withal your high displeasure : all this uttered with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow'd could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio's breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it : romeo he cries aloud 'hold friends <eos> friends part <eos>' and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and 'twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertain'd revenge and to 't they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain <eos> and as he fell did romeo turn and fly <eos> this is the truth or let benvolio die <eos> lady capulet : he is a kinsman to the montague affection makes him false he speaks not true : some twenty of them fought in this black strife and all those twenty could but kill one life <eos> i beg for justice which thou prince must give romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live <eos> prince : romeo slew him he slew mercutio who now the price of his dear blood doth owe <eos> montague : not romeo prince he was mercutio's friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt <eos> prince : and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence : i have an interest in your hate's proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine : i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses : therefore use none : let romeo hence in haste else when he's found that hour is his last <eos> bear hence this body and attend our will : mercy but murders pardoning those that kill <eos> juliet : gallop apace you fiery-footed steeds towards phoebus' lodging : such a wagoner as phaethon would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately <eos> spread thy close curtain love-performing night that runaway's eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen <eos> lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties or if love be blind it best agrees with night <eos> come civil night thou sober-suited matron all in black and learn me how to lose a winning match play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods : hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold think true love acted simple modesty <eos> come night come romeo come thou day in night for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven's back <eos> come gentle night come loving black-brow'd night give me my romeo and when he shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun <eos> o i have bought the mansion of a love but not possess'd it and though i am sold not yet enjoy'd : so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them <eos> o here comes my nurse and she brings news and every tongue that speaks but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence <eos> now nurse what news <eos> what hast thou there <eos> the cords that romeo bid thee fetch <eos> nurse : ay ay the cords <eos> juliet : ay me <eos> what news <eos> why dost thou wring thy hands <eos> nurse : ah well-a-day <eos> he's dead he's dead he's dead <eos> we are undone lady we are undone <eos> alack the day <eos> he's gone he's kill'd he's dead <eos> juliet : can heaven be so envious <eos> nurse : romeo can though heaven cannot : o romeo romeo <eos> who ever would have thought it <eos> romeo <eos> juliet : what devil art thou that dost torment me thus <eos> this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell <eos> hath romeo slain himself <eos> say thou but 'i' and that bare vowel 'i' shall poison more than the death-darting eye of cockatrice : i am not i if there be such an i or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'i <eos>' if he be slain say 'i' or if not no : brief sounds determine of my weal or woe <eos> nurse : i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes <eos> god save the mark <eos> <eos>here on his manly breast : a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse pale pale as ashes all bedaub'd in blood all in gore-blood i swounded at the sight <eos> juliet : o break my heart <eos> poor bankrupt break at once <eos> to prison eyes ne'er look on liberty <eos> vile earth to earth resign end motion here and thou and romeo press one heavy bier <eos> nurse : o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had <eos> o courteous tybalt <eos> honest gentleman <eos> that ever i should live to see thee dead <eos> juliet : what storm is this that blows so contrary <eos> is romeo slaughter'd and is tybalt dead <eos> my dear-loved cousin and my dearer lord <eos> then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom <eos> for who is living if those two are gone <eos> nurse : tybalt is gone and romeo banished romeo that kill'd him he is banished <eos> juliet : o god <eos> did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood <eos> nurse : it did it did alas the day it did <eos> juliet : o serpent heart hid with a flowering face <eos> did ever dragon keep so fair a cave <eos> beautiful tyrant <eos> fiend angelical <eos> dove-feather'd raven <eos> wolvish-ravening lamb <eos> despised substance of divinest show <eos> just opposite to what thou justly seem'st a damned saint an honourable villain <eos> o nature what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in moral paradise of such sweet flesh <eos> was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound <eos> o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace <eos> nurse : there's no trust no faith no honesty in men all perjured all forsworn all naught all dissemblers <eos> ah where's my man <eos> give me some aqua vitae : these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old <eos> shame come to romeo <eos> juliet : blister'd be thy tongue for such a wish <eos> he was not born to shame : upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit for 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd sole monarch of the universal earth <eos> o what a beast was i to chide at him <eos> nurse : will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin <eos> juliet : shall i speak ill of him that is my husband <eos> ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name when i thy three-hours wife have mangled it <eos> but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin <eos> that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband : back foolish tears back to your native spring your tributary drops belong to woe which you mistaking offer up to joy <eos> my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband : all this is comfort wherefore weep i then <eos> some word there was worser than tybalt's death that murder'd me : i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds : 'tybalt is dead and romeo <eos>banished' that 'banished' that one word 'banished' hath slain ten thousand tybalts <eos> tybalt's death was woe enough if it had ended there : or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rank'd with other griefs why follow'd not when she said 'tybalt's dead' thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentations might have moved <eos> but with a rear-ward following tybalt's death 'romeo is banished' to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead <eos> 'romeo is banished <eos>' there is no end no limit measure bound in that word's death no words can that woe sound <eos> where is my father and my mother nurse <eos> nurse : weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse : will you go to them <eos> i will bring you thither <eos> juliet : wash they his wounds with tears : mine shall be spent when theirs are dry for romeo's banishment <eos> take up those cords : poor ropes you are beguiled both you and i for romeo is exiled : he made you for a highway to my bed but i a maid die maiden-widowed <eos> come cords come nurse i'll to my wedding-bed and death not romeo take my maidenhead <eos> nurse : hie to your chamber : i'll find romeo to comfort you : i wot well where he is <eos> hark ye your romeo will be here at night : i'll to him he is hid at laurence' cell <eos> juliet : o find him <eos> give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell <eos> friar laurence : romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man : affliction is enamour'd of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity <eos> romeo : father what news <eos> what is the prince's doom <eos> what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not <eos> friar laurence : too familiar is my dear son with such sour company : i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom <eos> romeo : what less than dooms-day is the prince's doom <eos> friar laurence : a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips not body's death but body's banishment <eos> romeo : ha banishment <eos> be merciful say 'death' for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death : do not say 'banishment <eos>' friar laurence : hence from verona art thou banished : be patient for the world is broad and wide <eos> romeo : there is no world without verona walls but purgatory torture hell itself <eos> hence-banished is banish'd from the world and world's exile is death : then banished is death mis-term'd : calling death banishment thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me <eos> friar laurence : o deadly sin <eos> o rude unthankfulness <eos> thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince taking thy part hath rush'd aside the law and turn'd that black word death to banishment : this is dear mercy and thou seest it not <eos> romeo : 'tis torture and not mercy : heaven is here where juliet lives and every cat and dog and little mouse every unworthy thing live here in heaven and may look on her but romeo may not : more validity more honourable state more courtship lives in carrion-flies than romeo : they my seize on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips who even in pure and vestal modesty still blush as thinking their own kisses sin but romeo may not he is banished : flies may do this but i from this must fly : they are free men but i am banished <eos> and say'st thou yet that exile is not death <eos> hadst thou no poison mix'd no sharp-ground knife no sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean but 'banished' to kill me <eos> <eos>'banished' <eos> o friar the damned use that word in hell howlings attend it : how hast thou the heart being a divine a ghostly confessor a sin-absolver and my friend profess'd to mangle me with that word 'banished' <eos> friar laurence : thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word <eos> romeo : o thou wilt speak again of banishment <eos> friar laurence : i'll give thee armour to keep off that word : adversity's sweet milk philosophy to comfort thee though thou art banished <eos> romeo : yet 'banished' <eos> hang up philosophy <eos> unless philosophy can make a juliet displant a town reverse a prince's doom it helps not it prevails not : talk no more <eos> friar laurence : o then i see that madmen have no ears <eos> romeo : how should they when that wise men have no eyes <eos> friar laurence : let me dispute with thee of thy estate <eos> romeo : thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel : wert thou as young as i juliet thy love an hour but married tybalt murdered doting like me and like me banished then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground as i do now taking the measure of an unmade grave <eos> friar laurence : arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself <eos> romeo : not i unless the breath of heartsick groans mist-like infold me from the search of eyes <eos> friar laurence : hark how they knock <eos> who's there <eos> romeo arise thou wilt be taken <eos> stay awhile <eos> stand up run to my study <eos> by and by <eos> god's will what simpleness is this <eos> i come i come <eos> who knocks so hard <eos> whence come you <eos> what's your will <eos> nurse : friar laurence : welcome then <eos> nurse : o holy friar o tell me holy friar where is my lady's lord where's romeo <eos> friar laurence : there on the ground with his own tears made drunk <eos> nurse : o he is even in my mistress' case just in her case <eos> o woful sympathy <eos> piteous predicament <eos> even so lies she blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering <eos> stand up stand up stand and you be a man : for juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand why should you fall into so deep an o <eos> romeo : nurse <eos> nurse : ah sir <eos> ah sir <eos> well death's the end of all <eos> romeo : spakest thou of juliet <eos> how is it with her <eos> doth she not think me an old murderer now i have stain'd the childhood of our joy with blood removed but little from her own <eos> where is she <eos> and how doth she <eos> and what says my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love <eos> nurse : o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and now falls on her bed and then starts up and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries and then down falls again <eos> romeo : as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that name's cursed hand murder'd her kinsman <eos> o tell me friar tell me in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge <eos> tell me that i may sack the hateful mansion <eos> friar laurence : hold thy desperate hand : art thou a man <eos> thy form cries out thou art : thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast : unseemly woman in a seeming man <eos> or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both <eos> thou hast amazed me : by my holy order i thought thy disposition better temper'd <eos> hast thou slain tybalt <eos> wilt thou slay thyself <eos> and stay thy lady too that lives in thee by doing damned hate upon thyself <eos> why rail'st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth <eos> since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose <eos> fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit which like a usurer abound'st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit : thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish thy wit that ornament to shape and love misshapen in the conduct of them both like powder in a skitless soldier's flask is set afire by thine own ignorance and thou dismember'd with thine own defence <eos> what rouse thee man <eos> thy juliet is alive for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead there art thou happy : tybalt would kill thee but thou slew'st tybalt there are thou happy too : the law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile there art thou happy : a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back happiness courts thee in her best array but like a misbehaved and sullen wench thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love : take heed take heed for such die miserable <eos> go get thee to thy love as was decreed ascend her chamber hence and comfort her : but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou went'st forth in lamentation <eos> go before nurse : commend me to thy lady and bid her hasten all the house to bed which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto : romeo is coming <eos> nurse : o lord i could have stay'd here all the night to hear good counsel : o what learning is <eos> my lord i'll tell my lady you will come <eos> romeo : do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide <eos> nurse : here sir a ring she bid me give you sir : hie you make haste for it grows very late <eos> romeo : how well my comfort is revived by this <eos> friar laurence : go hence good night and here stands all your state : either be gone before the watch be set or by the break of day disguised from hence : sojourn in mantua i'll find out your man and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here : give me thy hand 'tis late : farewell good night <eos> romeo : but that a joy past joy calls out on me it were a grief so brief to part with thee : farewell <eos> capulet : things have fall'n out sir so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter : look you she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly and so did i : <eos>well we were born to die <eos> 'tis very late she'll not come down to-night : i promise you but for your company i would have been a-bed an hour ago <eos> paris : these times of woe afford no time to woo <eos> madam good night : commend me to your daughter <eos> lady capulet : i will and know her mind early to-morrow to-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness <eos> capulet : sir paris i will make a desperate tender of my child's love : i think she will be ruled in all respects by me nay more i doubt it not <eos> wife go you to her ere you go to bed acquaint her here of my son paris' love and bid her mark you me on wednesday next <eos> but soft <eos> what day is this <eos> paris : monday my lord capulet : monday <eos> ha ha <eos> well wednesday is too soon o' thursday let it be : o' thursday tell her she shall be married to this noble earl <eos> will you be ready <eos> do you like this haste <eos> we'll keep no great ado <eos>a friend or two for hark you tybalt being slain so late it may be thought we held him carelessly being our kinsman if we revel much : therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends and there an end <eos> but what say you to thursday <eos> paris : my lord i would that thursday were to-morrow <eos> capulet : well get you gone : o' thursday be it then <eos> go you to juliet ere you go to bed prepare her wife against this wedding-day <eos> farewell my lord <eos> light to my chamber ho <eos> afore me <eos> it is so very very late that we may call it early by and by <eos> good night <eos> juliet : wilt thou be gone <eos> it is not yet near day : it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree : believe me love it was the nightingale <eos> romeo : it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale : look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east : night's candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops <eos> i must be gone and live or stay and die <eos> juliet : yon light is not day-light i know it i : it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torch-bearer and light thee on thy way to mantua : therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone <eos> romeo : let me be ta'en let me be put to death i am content so thou wilt have it so <eos> i'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye 'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads : i have more care to stay than will to go : come death and welcome <eos> juliet wills it so <eos> how is't my soul <eos> let's talk it is not day <eos> juliet : it is it is : hie hence be gone away <eos> it is the lark that sings so out of tune straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps <eos> some say the lark makes sweet division this doth not so for she divideth us : some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes o now i would they had changed voices too <eos> since arm from arm that voice doth us affray hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day o now be gone more light and light it grows <eos> romeo : more light and light more dark and dark our woes <eos> nurse : madam <eos> juliet : nurse <eos> nurse : your lady mother is coming to your chamber : the day is broke be wary look about <eos> juliet : then window let day in and let life out <eos> romeo : farewell farewell <eos> one kiss and i'll descend <eos> juliet : art thou gone so <eos> love lord ay husband friend <eos> i must hear from thee every day in the hour for in a minute there are many days : o by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo <eos> romeo : farewell <eos> i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings love to thee <eos> juliet : o think'st thou we shall ever meet again <eos> romeo : i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come <eos> juliet : o god i have an ill-divining soul <eos> methinks i see thee now thou art below as one dead in the bottom of a tomb : either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale <eos> romeo : and trust me love in my eye so do you : dry sorrow drinks our blood <eos> adieu adieu <eos> juliet : o fortune fortune <eos> all men call thee fickle : if thou art fickle what dost thou with him <eos> that is renown'd for faith <eos> be fickle fortune for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back <eos> lady capulet : juliet : who is't that calls <eos> is it my lady mother <eos> is she not down so late or up so early <eos> what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither <eos> lady capulet : why how now juliet <eos> juliet : madam i am not well <eos> lady capulet : evermore weeping for your cousin's death <eos> what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears <eos> an if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live therefore have done : some grief shows much of love but much of grief shows still some want of wit <eos> juliet : yet let me weep for such a feeling loss <eos> lady capulet : so shall you feel the loss but not the friend which you weep for <eos> juliet : feeling so the loss cannot choose but ever weep the friend <eos> lady capulet : well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him <eos> juliet : what villain madam <eos> lady capulet : that same villain romeo <eos> juliet : lady capulet : that is because the traitor murderer lives <eos> juliet : ay madam from the reach of these my hands : would none but i might venge my cousin's death <eos> lady capulet : we will have vengeance for it fear thou not : then weep no more <eos> i'll send to one in mantua where that same banish'd runagate doth live shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram that he shall soon keep tybalt company : and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied <eos> juliet : indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him <eos>dead <eos> is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd <eos> madam if you could find out but a man to bear a poison i would temper it that romeo should upon receipt thereof soon sleep in quiet <eos> o how my heart abhors to hear him named and cannot come to him <eos> to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughter'd him <eos> lady capulet : find thou the means and i'll find such a man <eos> but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings girl <eos> juliet : and joy comes well in such a needy time : what are they i beseech your ladyship <eos> lady capulet : well well thou hast a careful father child one who to put thee from thy heaviness hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expect'st not nor i look'd not for <eos> juliet : madam in happy time what day is that <eos> lady capulet : marry my child early next thursday morn the gallant young and noble gentleman the county paris at saint peter's church shall happily make thee there a joyful bride <eos> juliet : now by saint peter's church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride <eos> i wonder at this haste that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo <eos> i pray you tell my lord and father madam i will not marry yet and when i do i swear it shall be romeo whom you know i hate rather than paris <eos> these are news indeed <eos> lady capulet : here comes your father tell him so yourself and see how he will take it at your hands <eos> capulet : when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew but for the sunset of my brother's son it rains downright <eos> how now <eos> a conduit girl <eos> what still in tears <eos> evermore showering <eos> in one little body thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind for still thy eyes which i may call the sea do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs who raging with thy tears and they with them without a sudden calm will overset thy tempest-tossed body <eos> how now wife <eos> have you deliver'd to her our decree <eos> lady capulet : ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks <eos> i would the fool were married to her grave <eos> capulet : soft <eos> take me with you take me with you wife <eos> how <eos> will she none <eos> doth she not give us thanks <eos> is she not proud <eos> doth she not count her blest unworthy as she is that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom <eos> juliet : not proud you have but thankful that you have : proud can i never be of what i hate but thankful even for hate that is meant love <eos> capulet : how now how now chop-logic <eos> what is this <eos> 'proud' and 'i thank you' and 'i thank you not' and yet 'not proud' mistress minion you thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds but fettle your fine joints 'gainst thursday next to go with paris to saint peter's church or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither <eos> out you green-sickness carrion <eos> out you baggage <eos> you tallow-face <eos> lady capulet : fie fie <eos> what are you mad <eos> juliet : good father i beseech you on my knees hear me with patience but to speak a word <eos> capulet : hang thee young baggage <eos> disobedient wretch <eos> i tell thee what : get thee to church o' thursday or never after look me in the face : speak not reply not do not answer me my fingers itch <eos> wife we scarce thought us blest that god had lent us but this only child but now i see this one is one too much and that we have a curse in having her : out on her hilding <eos> nurse : god in heaven bless her <eos> you are to blame my lord to rate her so <eos> capulet : and why my lady wisdom <eos> hold your tongue good prudence smatter with your gossips go <eos> nurse : i speak no treason <eos> capulet : o god ye god-den <eos> nurse : may not one speak <eos> capulet : peace you mumbling fool <eos> utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl for here we need it not <eos> lady capulet : you are too hot <eos> capulet : god's bread <eos> it makes me mad : day night hour tide time work play alone in company still my care hath been to have her match'd : and having now provided a gentleman of noble parentage of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train'd stuff'd as they say with honourable parts proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man and then to have a wretched puling fool a whining mammet in her fortune's tender to answer 'i'll not wed i cannot love i am too young i pray you pardon me <eos>' but as you will not wed i'll pardon you : graze where you will you shall not house with me : look to't think on't i do not use to jest <eos> thursday is near lay hand on heart advise : an you be mine i'll give you to my friend and you be not hang beg starve die in the streets for by my soul i'll ne'er acknowledge thee nor what is mine shall never do thee good : trust to't bethink you i'll not be forsworn <eos> juliet : is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief <eos> o sweet my mother cast me not away <eos> delay this marriage for a month a week or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies <eos> lady capulet : talk not to me for i'll not speak a word : do as thou wilt for i have done with thee <eos> juliet : o god <eos> <eos>o nurse how shall this be prevented <eos> my husband is on earth my faith in heaven how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth <eos> comfort me counsel me <eos> alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself <eos> what say'st thou <eos> hast thou not a word of joy <eos> some comfort nurse <eos> nurse : faith here it is <eos> romeo is banish'd and all the world to nothing that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you or if he do it needs must be by stealth <eos> then since the case so stands as now it doth i think it best you married with the county <eos> o he's a lovely gentleman <eos> romeo's a dishclout to him : an eagle madam hath not so green so quick so fair an eye as paris hath <eos> beshrew my very heart i think you are happy in this second match for it excels your first : or if it did not your first is dead or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use of him <eos> juliet : speakest thou from thy heart <eos> nurse : and from my soul too or else beshrew them both <eos> juliet : amen <eos> nurse : what <eos> juliet : well thou hast comforted me marvellous much <eos> go in : and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to laurence' cell to make confession and to be absolved <eos> nurse : marry i will and this is wisely done <eos> juliet : ancient damnation <eos> o most wicked fiend <eos> is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand times <eos> go counsellor thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain <eos> i'll to the friar to know his remedy : if all else fail myself have power to die <eos> friar laurence : on thursday sir <eos> the time is very short <eos> paris : my father capulet will have it so and i am nothing slow to slack his haste <eos> friar laurence : you say you do not know the lady's mind : uneven is the course i like it not <eos> paris : immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death and therefore have i little talk'd of love for venus smiles not in a house of tears <eos> now sir her father counts it dangerous that she doth give her sorrow so much sway and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation of her tears which too much minded by herself alone may be put from her by society : now do you know the reason of this haste <eos> friar laurence : paris : happily met my lady and my wife <eos> juliet : that may be sir when i may be a wife <eos> paris : that may be must be love on thursday next <eos> juliet : what must be shall be <eos> friar laurence : that's a certain text <eos> paris : come you to make confession to this father <eos> juliet : to answer that i should confess to you <eos> paris : do not deny to him that you love me <eos> juliet : i will confess to you that i love him <eos> paris : so will ye i am sure that you love me <eos> juliet : if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face <eos> paris : poor soul thy face is much abused with tears <eos> juliet : the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite <eos> paris : thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report <eos> juliet : that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face <eos> paris : thy face is mine and thou hast slander'd it <eos> juliet : it may be so for it is not mine own <eos> are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass <eos> friar laurence : my leisure serves me pensive daughter now <eos> my lord we must entreat the time alone <eos> paris : god shield i should disturb devotion <eos> juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye : till then adieu and keep this holy kiss <eos> juliet : o shut the door <eos> and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past cure past help <eos> friar laurence : ah juliet i already know thy grief it strains me past the compass of my wits : i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it on thursday next be married to this county <eos> juliet : tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it : if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife i'll help it presently <eos> god join'd my heart and romeo's thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo seal'd shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both : therefore out of thy long-experienced time give me some present counsel or behold 'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring <eos> be not so long to speak i long to die if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy <eos> friar laurence : hold daughter : i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate an execution <eos> as that is desperate which we would prevent <eos> if rather than to marry county paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame that copest with death himself to scape from it : and if thou darest i'll give thee remedy <eos> juliet : o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of yonder tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or shut me nightly in a charnel-house o'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a new-made grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love <eos> friar laurence : hold then go home be merry give consent to marry paris : wednesday is to-morrow : to-morrow night look that thou lie alone let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber : take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilled liquor drink thou off when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse shall keep his native progress but surcease : no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall like death when he shuts up the day of life each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death : and in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours and then awake as from a pleasant sleep <eos> now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead : then as the manner of our country is in thy best robes uncover'd on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie <eos> in the mean time against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come : and he and i will watch thy waking and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua <eos> and this shall free thee from this present shame if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valour in the acting it <eos> juliet : give me give me <eos> o tell not me of fear <eos> friar laurence : hold get you gone be strong and prosperous in this resolve : i'll send a friar with speed to mantua with my letters to thy lord <eos> juliet : love give me strength <eos> and strength shall help afford <eos> farewell dear father <eos> capulet : so many guests invite as here are writ <eos> sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks <eos> second servant : you shall have none ill sir for i'll try if they can lick their fingers <eos> capulet : how canst thou try them so <eos> second servant : marry sir 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers : therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me <eos> capulet : go be gone <eos> we shall be much unfurnished for this time <eos> what is my daughter gone to friar laurence <eos> nurse : ay forsooth <eos> capulet : well he may chance to do some good on her : a peevish self-will'd harlotry it is <eos> nurse : see where she comes from shrift with merry look <eos> capulet : how now my headstrong <eos> where have you been gadding <eos> juliet : where i have learn'd me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests and am enjoin'd by holy laurence to fall prostrate here and beg your pardon : pardon i beseech you <eos> henceforward i am ever ruled by you <eos> capulet : send for the county go tell him of this : i'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning <eos> juliet : i met the youthful lord at laurence' cell and gave him what becomed love i might not step o'er the bounds of modesty <eos> capulet : why i am glad on't this is well : stand up : this is as't should be <eos> let me see the county ay marry go i say and fetch him hither <eos> now afore god <eos> this reverend holy friar our whole city is much bound to him <eos> juliet : nurse will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me to-morrow <eos> lady capulet : no not till thursday there is time enough <eos> capulet : go nurse go with her : we'll to church to-morrow <eos> lady capulet : we shall be short in our provision : 'tis now near night <eos> capulet : tush i will stir about and all things shall be well i warrant thee wife : go thou to juliet help to deck up her i'll not to bed to-night let me alone i'll play the housewife for this once <eos> what ho <eos> they are all forth <eos> well i will walk myself to county paris to prepare him up against to-morrow : my heart is wondrous light since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd <eos> juliet : ay those attires are best : but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself to-night for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou know'st is cross and full of sin <eos> lady capulet : what are you busy ho <eos> need you my help <eos> juliet : no madam we have cull'd such necessaries as are behoveful for our state to-morrow : so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business <eos> lady capulet : good night : get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need <eos> juliet : farewell <eos> god knows when we shall meet again <eos> i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life : i'll call them back again to comfort me : nurse <eos> what should she do here <eos> my dismal scene i needs must act alone <eos> come vial <eos> what if this mixture do not work at all <eos> shall i be married then to-morrow morning <eos> no no : this shall forbid it : lie thou there <eos> what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath minister'd to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd because he married me before to romeo <eos> i fear it is : and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man <eos> how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me <eos> there's a fearful point <eos> shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes <eos> or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place <eos> as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for these many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed : where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies festering in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort <eos> alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad : <eos> o if i wake shall i not be distraught environed with all these hideous fears <eos> and madly play with my forefather's joints <eos> and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud <eos> and in this rage with some great kinsman's bone as with a club dash out my desperate brains <eos> o look <eos> methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo that did spit his body upon a rapier's point : stay tybalt stay <eos> romeo i come <eos> this do i drink to thee <eos> lady capulet : hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse <eos> nurse : they call for dates and quinces in the pastry <eos> capulet : come stir stir stir <eos> the second cock hath crow'd the curfew-bell hath rung 'tis three o'clock : look to the baked meats good angelica : spare not for the cost <eos> nurse : go you cot-quean go get you to bed faith you'll be sick to-morrow for this night's watching <eos> capulet : no not a whit : what <eos> i have watch'd ere now all night for lesser cause and ne'er been sick <eos> lady capulet : ay you have been a mouse-hunt in your time but i will watch you from such watching now <eos> capulet : a jealous hood a jealous hood <eos> now fellow what's there <eos> first servant : things for the cook sir but i know not what <eos> capulet : make haste make haste <eos> sirrah fetch drier logs : call peter he

<eos> lady capulet : alack the day she's dead she's dead she's dead <eos> capulet : ha <eos> let me see her : out alas <eos> she's cold : her blood is settled and her joints are stiff life and these lips have long been separated : death lies on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower of all the field <eos> nurse : o lamentable day <eos> lady capulet : o woful time <eos> capulet : death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail ties up my tongue and will not let me speak <eos> friar laurence : come is the bride ready to go to church <eos> capulet : ready to go but never to return <eos> o son <eos> the night before thy wedding-day hath death lain with thy wife <eos> there she lies flower as she was deflowered by him <eos> death is my son-in-law death is my heir my daughter he hath wedded : i will die and leave him all life living all is death's <eos> paris : have i thought long to see this morning's face and doth it give me such a sight as this <eos> lady capulet : accursed unhappy wretched hateful day <eos> most miserable hour that e'er time saw in lasting labour of his pilgrimage <eos> but one poor one one poor and loving child but one thing to rejoice and solace in and cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight <eos> nurse : o woe <eos> o woful woful woful day <eos> most lamentable day most woful day that ever ever i did yet behold <eos> o day <eos> o day <eos> o day <eos> o hateful day <eos> never was seen so black a day as this : o woful day o woful day <eos> paris : beguiled divorced wronged spited slain <eos> most detestable death by thee beguil'd by cruel cruel thee quite overthrown <eos> o love <eos> o life <eos> not life but love in death <eos> capulet : despised distressed hated martyr'd kill'd <eos> uncomfortable time why camest thou now to murder murder our solemnity <eos> o child <eos> o child <eos> my soul and not my child <eos> dead art thou <eos> alack <eos> my child is dead and with my child my joys are buried <eos> friar laurence : peace ho for shame <eos> confusion's cure lives not in these confusions <eos> heaven and yourself had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all and all the better is it for the maid : your part in her you could not keep from death but heaven keeps his part in eternal life <eos> the most you sought was her promotion for 'twas your heaven she should be advanced : and weep ye now seeing she is advanced above the clouds as high as heaven itself <eos> o in this love you love your child so ill that you run mad seeing that she is well : she's not well married that lives married long but she's best married that dies married young <eos> dry up your tears and stick your rosemary on this fair corse and as the custom is in all her best array bear her to church : for though fond nature bids us an lament yet nature's tears are reason's merriment <eos> capulet : all things that we ordained festival turn from their office to black funeral our instruments to melancholy bells our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse and all things change them to the contrary <eos> friar laurence : sir go you in and madam go with him and go sir paris every one prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave : the heavens do lour upon you for some ill move them no more by crossing their high will <eos> first musician : faith we may put up our pipes and be gone <eos> nurse : honest goodfellows ah put up put up for well you know this is a pitiful case <eos> first musician : ay by my troth the case may be amended <eos> peter : musicians o musicians 'heart's ease heart's ease :' o an you will have me live play 'heart's ease <eos>' first musician : why 'heart's ease <eos>' peter : o musicians because my heart itself plays 'my heart is full of woe :' o play me some merry dump to comfort me <eos> first musician : not a dump we 'tis no time to play now <eos> peter : you will not then <eos> first musician : no <eos> peter : i will then give it you soundly <eos> first musician : what will you give us <eos> peter : no money on my faith but the gleek i will give you the minstrel <eos> first musician : then i will give you the serving-creature <eos> peter : then will i lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate <eos> i will carry no crotchets : i'll re you i'll fa you do

dry-beat you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger <eos> answer me like men : 'when griping grief the heart doth wound and doleful dumps the mind oppress then music with her silver sound' <eos> why 'silver sound' <eos> why 'music with her silver sound' <eos> what say you simon catling <eos> musician : marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound <eos> peter : pretty <eos> what say you hugh rebeck <eos> second musician : i say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver <eos> peter : pretty too <eos> what say you james soundpost <eos> third musician : faith i know not what to say <eos> peter : o i cry you mercy you are the singer : i will say for you <eos> it is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no gold for sounding : 'then music with her silver sound with speedy help doth lend redress <eos>' first musician : what a pestilent knave is this same <eos> second musician : hang him jack <eos> come we'll in here tarry for the mourners and stay dinner <eos> romeo : if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand : my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts <eos> i dreamt my lady came and found me dead <eos> strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think <eos> <eos> and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor <eos> ah me <eos> how sweet is love itself possess'd when but love's shadows are so rich in joy <eos> news from verona <eos> <eos>how now balthasar <eos> dost thou not bring me letters from the friar <eos> how doth my lady <eos> is my father well <eos> how fares my juliet <eos> that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well <eos> balthasar : then she is well and nothing can be ill : her body sleeps in capel's monument and her immortal part with angels lives <eos> i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault and presently took post to tell it you : o pardon me for bringing these ill news since you did leave it for my office sir <eos> romeo : is it even so <eos> then i defy you stars <eos> thou know'st my lodging : get me ink and paper and hire post-horses i will hence to-night <eos> balthasar : i do beseech you sir have patience : your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure <eos> romeo : tush thou art deceived : leave me and do the thing i bid thee do <eos> hast thou no letters to me from the friar <eos> balthasar : no my good lord <eos> romeo : no matter : get thee gone and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight <eos> well juliet i will lie with thee to-night <eos> let's see for means : o mischief thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men <eos> i do remember an apothecary <eos> and hereabouts he dwells <eos>which late i noted in tatter'd weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meagre were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones : and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuff'd and other skins of ill-shaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scatter'd to make up a show <eos> noting this penury to myself i said 'an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him <eos>' o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me <eos> as i remember this should be the house <eos> being holiday the beggar's shop is shut <eos> what ho <eos> apothecary <eos> apothecary : who calls so loud <eos> romeo : come hither man <eos> i see that thou art poor : hold there is forty ducats : let me have a dram of poison such soon-speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life-weary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharged of breath as violently as hasty powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb <eos> apothecary : such mortal drugs i have but mantua's law is death to any he that utters them <eos> romeo : art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fear'st to die <eos> famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thine eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the world's law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this <eos> apothecary : my poverty but not my will consents <eos> romeo : i pay thy poverty and not thy will <eos> apothecary : put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight <eos> romeo : there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls doing more murders in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell <eos> i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none <eos> farewell : buy food and get thyself in flesh <eos> come cordial and not poison go with me to juliet's grave for there must i use thee <eos> friar john : holy franciscan friar <eos> brother ho <eos> friar laurence : this same should be the voice of friar john <eos> welcome from mantua : what says romeo <eos> or if his mind be writ give me his letter <eos> friar john : going to find a bare-foot brother out one of our order to associate me here in this city visiting the sick and finding him the searchers of the town suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd <eos> friar laurence : who bare my letter then to romeo <eos> friar john : i could not send it <eos>here it is again <eos> nor get a messenger to bring it thee so fearful were they of infection <eos> friar laurence : unhappy fortune <eos> by my brotherhood the letter was not nice but full of charge of dear import and the neglecting it may do much danger <eos> friar john go hence get me an iron crow and bring it straight unto my cell <eos> friar john : brother i'll go and bring it thee <eos> friar laurence : now must i to the monument alone within three hours will fair juliet wake : she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had no notice of these accidents but i will write again to mantua and keep her at my cell till romeo come poor living corse closed in a dead man's tomb <eos> paris : give me thy torch boy : hence and stand aloof : yet put it out for i would not be seen <eos> under yond yew-trees lay thee all along holding thine ear close to the hollow ground so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread being loose unfirm with digging up of graves but thou shalt hear it : whistle then to me as signal that thou hear'st something approach <eos> give me those flowers <eos> do as i bid thee go <eos> page : paris : sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew <eos> o woe <eos> thy canopy is dust and stones <eos> which with sweet water nightly i will dew or wanting that with tears distill'd by moans : the obsequies that i for thee will keep nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep <eos> the boy gives warning something doth approach <eos> what cursed foot wanders this way to-night to cross my obsequies and true love's rite <eos> what with a torch <eos> muffle me night awhile <eos> romeo : give me that mattock and the wrenching iron <eos> hold take this letter early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father <eos> give me the light : upon thy life i charge thee whate'er thou hear'st or seest stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course <eos> why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady's face but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring a ring that i must use in dear employment : therefore hence be gone : but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs : the time and my intents are savage-wild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea <eos> balthasar : i will be gone sir and not trouble you <eos> romeo : so shalt thou show me friendship <eos> take thou that : live and be prosperous : and farewell good fellow <eos> balthasar : romeo : thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite i'll cram thee with more food <eos> paris : this is that banish'd haughty montague that murder'd my love's cousin with which grief it is supposed the fair creature died and here is come to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies : i will apprehend him <eos> stop thy unhallow'd toil vile montague <eos> can vengeance be pursued further than death <eos> condemned villain i do apprehend thee : obey and go with me for thou must die <eos> romeo : i must indeed and therefore came i hither <eos> good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man fly hence and leave me : think upon these gone let them affright thee <eos> i beseech thee youth put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury : o be gone <eos> by heaven i love thee better than myself for i come hither arm'd against myself : stay not be gone live and hereafter say a madman's mercy bade thee run away <eos> paris : i do defy thy conjurations and apprehend thee for a felon here <eos> romeo : wilt thou provoke me <eos> then have at thee boy <eos> page : o lord they fight <eos> i will go call the watch <eos> paris : o i am slain <eos> if thou be merciful open the tomb lay me with juliet <eos> romeo : in faith i will <eos> let me peruse this face <eos> mercutio's kinsman noble county paris <eos> what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode <eos> i think he told me paris should have married juliet : said he not so <eos> or did i dream it so <eos> or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so <eos> o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortune's book <eos> i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave a grave <eos> o no <eos> a lantern slaughter'd youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light <eos> death lie thou there by a dead man interr'd <eos> how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry <eos> which their keepers call a lightning before death : o how may i call this a lightning <eos> o my love <eos> my wife <eos> death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty : thou art not conquer'd beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and death's pale flag is not advanced there <eos> tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet <eos> o what more favour can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy <eos> forgive me cousin <eos> ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair <eos> shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour <eos> for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again : here here will i remain with worms that are thy chamber-maids o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh <eos> eyes look your last <eos> arms take your last embrace <eos> and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death <eos> come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide <eos> thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark <eos> here's to my love <eos> o true apothecary <eos> thy drugs are quick <eos> thus with a kiss i die <eos> friar laurence : saint francis be my speed <eos> how oft to-night have my old feet stumbled at graves <eos> who's there <eos> balthasar : here's one a friend and one that knows you well <eos> friar laurence : bliss be upon you <eos> tell me good my friend what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls <eos> as i discern it burneth in the capel's monument <eos> balthasar : it doth so holy sir and there's my master one that you love <eos> friar laurence : who is it <eos> balthasar : romeo <eos> friar laurence : how long hath he been there <eos> balthasar : full half an hour <eos> friar laurence : go with me to the vault <eos> balthasar : i dare not sir my master knows not but i am gone hence and fearfully did menace me with death if i did stay to look on his intents <eos> friar laurence : stay then i'll go alone <eos> fear comes upon me : o much i fear some ill unlucky thing <eos> balthasar : as i did sleep under this yew-tree here i dreamt my master and another fought and that my master slew him <eos> friar laurence : romeo <eos> alack alack what blood is this which stains the stony entrance of this sepulchre <eos> what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolour'd by this place of peace <eos> romeo <eos> o pale <eos> who else <eos> what paris too <eos> and steep'd in blood <eos> ah what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance <eos> the lady stirs <eos> juliet : o comfortable friar <eos> where is my lord <eos> i do remember well where i should be and there i am <eos> where is my romeo <eos> friar laurence : i hear some noise <eos> lady come from that nest of death contagion and unnatural sleep : a greater power than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents <eos> come come away <eos> thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead and paris too <eos> come i'll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns : stay not to question for the watch is coming come go good juliet i dare no longer stay <eos> juliet : go get thee hence for i will not away <eos> what's here <eos> a cup closed in my true love's hand <eos> poison i see hath been his timeless end : o churl <eos> drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after <eos> i will kiss thy lips haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make die with a restorative <eos> thy lips are warm <eos> first watchman : juliet : yea noise <eos> then i'll be brief <eos> o happy dagger <eos> this is thy sheath there rust and let me die <eos> page : this is the place there where the torch doth burn <eos> first watchman : the ground is bloody search about the churchyard : go some of you whoe'er you find attach <eos> pitiful sight <eos> here lies the county slain and juliet bleeding warm and newly dead who here hath lain these two days buried <eos> go tell the prince : run to the capulets : raise up the montagues : some others search : we see the ground whereon these woes do lie but the true ground of all these piteous woes we cannot without circumstance descry <eos> second watchman : here's romeo's man we found him in the churchyard <eos> first watchman : hold him in safety till the prince come hither <eos> third watchman : here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps : we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard side <eos> first watchman : a great suspicion : stay the friar too <eos> prince : what misadventure is so early up that calls our person from our morning's rest <eos> capulet : what should it be that they so shriek abroad <eos> lady capulet : the people in the street cry romeo some juliet and some paris and all run with open outcry toward our monument <eos> prince : what fear is this which startles in our ears <eos> first watchman : sovereign here lies the county paris slain and romeo dead and juliet dead before warm and new kill'd <eos> prince : search seek and know how this foul murder comes <eos> first watchman : here is a friar and slaughter'd romeo's man with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men's tombs <eos> capulet : o heavens <eos> o wife look how our daughter bleeds <eos> this dagger hath mista'en <eos>for lo his house is empty on the back of montague <eos> and it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom <eos> lady capulet : o me <eos> this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre <eos> prince : come montague for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down <eos> montague : alas my liege my wife is dead to-night grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath : what further woe conspires against mine age <eos> prince : look and thou shalt see <eos> montague : o thou untaught <eos> what manners is in this <eos> to press before thy father to a grave <eos> prince : seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death : meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience <eos> bring forth the parties of suspicion <eos> friar laurence : i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excused <eos> prince : then say at once what thou dost know in this <eos> friar laurence : i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale <eos> romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo's faithful wife : i married them and their stol'n marriage-day was tybalt's dooms-day whose untimely death banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined <eos> you to remove that siege of grief from her betroth'd and would have married her perforce to county paris : then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself <eos> then gave i her so tutor'd by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death : meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrow'd grave being the time the potion's force should cease <eos> but he which bore my letter friar john was stay'd by accident and yesternight return'd my letter back <eos> then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred's vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo : but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead <eos> she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience : but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself <eos> all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy : and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law <eos> prince : we still have known thee for a holy man <eos> where's romeo's man <eos> what can he say in this <eos> balthasar : i brought my master news of juliet's death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument <eos> this letter he early bid me give his father and threatened me with death going in the vault i departed not and left him there <eos> prince : give me the letter i will look on it <eos> where is the county's page that raised the watch <eos> sirrah what made your master in this place <eos> page : he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did : anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch <eos> prince : this letter doth make good the friar's words their course of love the tidings of her death : and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor 'pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet <eos> where be these enemies <eos> capulet <eos> montague <eos> see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love <eos> and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen : all are punish'd <eos> capulet : o brother montague give me thy hand : this is my daughter's jointure for no more can i demand <eos> montague : but i can give thee more : for i will raise her statue in pure gold that while verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet <eos> capulet : as rich shall romeo's by his lady's lie poor sacrifices of our enmity <eos> prince : a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head : go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardon'd and some punished : for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo <eos> warwick : i wonder how the king escaped our hands <eos> york : while we pursued the horsemen of the north he slily stole away and left his men : whereat the great lord of northumberland whose warlike ears could never brook retreat cheer'd up the drooping army and himself lord clifford and lord stafford all abreast charged our main battle's front and breaking in were by the swords of common soldiers slain <eos> edward : lord stafford's father duke of buckingham is either slain or wounded dangerously i cleft his beaver with a downright blow : that this is true father behold his blood <eos> montague : and brother here's the earl of wiltshire's blood whom i encounter'd as the battles join'd <eos> richard : speak thou for me and tell them what i did <eos> york : richard hath best deserved of all my sons <eos> but is your grace dead my lord of somerset <eos> norfolk : such hope have all the line of john of gaunt <eos> richard : thus do i hope to shake king henry's head <eos> warwick : and so do i <eos> victorious prince of york before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close <eos> this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat : possess it york for this is thine and not king henry's heirs' york : assist me then sweet warwick and i will for hither we have broken in by force <eos> norfolk : we'll all assist you he that flies shall die <eos> york : thanks gentle norfolk : stay by me my lords and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night <eos> warwick : and when the king comes offer no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce <eos> york : the queen this day here holds her parliament but little thinks we shall be of her council : by words or blows here let us win our right <eos> richard : arm'd as we are let's stay within this house <eos> warwick : the bloody parliament shall this be call'd unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice hath made us by-words to our enemies <eos> york : then leave me not my lords be resolute i mean to take possession of my right <eos> warwick : neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells <eos> i'll plant plantagenet root him up who dares : resolve thee richard claim the english crown <eos> king henry vi : my lords look where the sturdy rebel sits even in the chair of state : belike he means back'd by the power of warwick that false peer to aspire unto the crown and reign as king <eos> earl of northumberland he slew thy father <eos> and thine lord clifford and you both have vow'd revenge on him his sons his favourites and his friends <eos> northumberland : if i be not heavens be revenged on me <eos> clifford : the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel <eos> westmoreland : what shall we suffer this <eos> let's pluck him down : my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it <eos> king henry vi : be patient gentle earl of westmoreland <eos> clifford : patience is for poltroons such as he : he durst not sit there had your father lived <eos> my gracious lord here in the parliament let us assail the family of york <eos> northumberland : well hast thou spoken cousin : be it so <eos> king henry vi : ah know you not the city favours them and they have troops of soldiers at their beck <eos> exeter : but when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly <eos> king henry vi : far be the thought of this from henry's heart to make a shambles of the parliament-house <eos> cousin of exeter frowns words and threats shall be the war that henry means to use <eos> thou factious duke of york descend my throne and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet i am thy sovereign <eos> york : i am thine <eos> exeter : for shame come down : he made thee duke of york <eos> york : 'twas my inheritance as the earldom was <eos> exeter : thy father was a traitor to the crown <eos> warwick : exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry <eos> clifford : whom should he follow but his natural king <eos> warwick : true clifford and that's richard duke of york <eos> king henry vi : and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne <eos> york : it must and shall be so : content thyself <eos> warwick : be duke of lancaster let him be king <eos> westmoreland : he is both king and duke of lancaster and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain <eos> warwick : and warwick shall disprove it <eos> you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers and with colours spread march'd through the city to the palace gates <eos> northumberland : yes warwick i remember it to my grief and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it <eos> westmoreland : plantagenet of thee and these thy sons thy kinsman and thy friends i'll have more lives than drops of blood were in my father's veins <eos> clifford : urge it no more lest that instead of words i send thee warwick such a messenger as shall revenge his death before i stir <eos> warwick : poor clifford <eos> how i scorn his worthless threats <eos> york : will you we show our title to the crown <eos> if not our swords shall plead it in the field <eos> king henry vi : what title hast thou traitor to the crown <eos> thy father was as thou art duke of york thy grandfather roger mortimer earl of march : i am the son of henry the fifth who made the dauphin and the french to stoop and seized upon their towns and provinces <eos> warwick : talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all <eos> king henry vi : the lord protector lost it and not i : when i was crown'd i was but nine months old <eos> richard : you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose <eos> father tear the crown from the usurper's head <eos> edward : sweet father do so set it on your head <eos> montague : good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus <eos> richard : sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly <eos> york : sons peace <eos> king henry vi : peace thou <eos> and give king henry leave to speak <eos> warwick : plantagenet shall speak first : hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live <eos> king henry vi : think'st thou that i will leave my kingly throne wherein my grandsire and my father sat <eos> no : first shall war unpeople this my realm ay and their colours often borne in france and now in england to our heart's great sorrow shall be my winding-sheet <eos> why faint you lords <eos> my title's good and better far than his <eos> warwick : prove it henry and thou shalt be king <eos> king henry vi : henry the fourth by conquest got the crown <eos> york : 'twas by rebellion against his king <eos> king henry vi : york : what then <eos> king henry vi : an if he may then am i lawful king for richard in the view of many lords resign'd the crown to henry the fourth whose heir my father was and i am his <eos> york : he rose against him being his sovereign and made him to resign his crown perforce <eos> warwick : suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown <eos> exeter : no for he could not so resign his crown but that the next heir should succeed and reign <eos> king henry vi : art thou against us duke of exeter <eos> exeter : his is the right and therefore pardon me <eos> york : why whisper you my lords and answer not <eos> exeter : my conscience tells me he is lawful king <eos> king henry vi : northumberland : plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st think not that henry shall be so deposed <eos> warwick : deposed he shall be in despite of all <eos> northumberland : thou art deceived : 'tis not thy southern power of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud can set the duke up in despite of me <eos> clifford : king henry be thy title right or wrong lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence : may that ground gape and swallow me alive where i shall kneel to him that slew my father <eos> king henry vi : o clifford how thy words revive my heart <eos> york : henry of lancaster resign thy crown <eos> what mutter you or what conspire you lords <eos> warwick : do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with armed men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood <eos> king henry vi : my lord of warwick hear me but one word : let me for this my life-time reign as king <eos> york : confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest <eos> king henry vi : i am content : richard plantagenet enjoy the kingdom after my decease <eos> clifford : what wrong is this unto the prince your son <eos> warwick : what good is this to england and himself <eos> westmoreland : base fearful and despairing henry <eos> clifford : how hast thou injured both thyself and us <eos> westmoreland : i cannot stay to hear these articles <eos> northumberland : nor i <eos> clifford : come cousin let us tell the queen these news <eos> westmoreland : farewell faint-hearted and degenerate king in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides <eos> northumberland : be thou a prey unto the house of york and die in bands for this unmanly deed <eos> clifford : in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome or live in peace abandon'd and despised <eos> warwick : turn this way henry and regard them not <eos> exeter : they seek revenge and therefore will not yield <eos> king henry vi : ah exeter <eos> warwick : why should you sigh my lord <eos> king henry vi : not for myself lord warwick but my son whom i unnaturally shall disinherit <eos> but be it as it may : i here entail the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever conditionally that here thou take an oath to cease this civil war and whilst i live to honour me as thy king and sovereign and neither by treason nor hostility to seek to put me down and reign thyself <eos> york : this oath i willingly take and will perform <eos> warwick : long live king henry <eos> plantagenet embrace him <eos> king henry vi : and long live thou and these thy forward sons <eos> york : now york and lancaster are reconciled <eos> exeter : accursed be he that seeks to make them foes <eos> york : farewell my gracious lord i'll to my castle <eos> warwick : and i'll keep london with my soldiers <eos> norfolk : and i to norfolk with my followers <eos> montague : and i unto the sea from whence i came <eos> king henry vi : and i with grief and sorrow to the court <eos> exeter : here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger : i'll steal away <eos> king henry vi : exeter so will i <eos> queen margaret : nay go not from me i will follow thee <eos> king henry vi : be patient gentle queen and i will stay <eos> queen margaret : who can be patient in such extremes <eos> ah wretched man <eos> would i had died a maid and never seen thee never borne thee son seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus <eos> hadst thou but loved him half so well as i or felt that pain which i did for him once or nourish'd him as i did with my blood thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there rather than have that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son <eos> prince edward : father you cannot disinherit me : if you be king why should not i succeed <eos> king henry vi : pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son : the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me <eos> queen margaret : enforced thee <eos> art thou king and wilt be forced <eos> i shame to hear thee speak <eos> ah timorous wretch <eos> thou hast undone thyself thy son and me and given unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance <eos> to entail him and his heirs unto the crown what is it but to make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy time <eos> warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas the duke is made protector of the realm and yet shalt thou be safe <eos> such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves <eos> had i been there which am a silly woman the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act <eos> but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour : and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself both from thy table henry and thy bed until that act of parliament be repeal'd whereby my son is disinherited <eos> the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours will follow mine if once they see them spread and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york <eos> thus do i leave thee <eos> come son let's away our army is ready come we'll after them <eos> king henry vi : stay gentle margaret and hear me speak <eos> queen margaret : thou hast spoke too much already : get thee gone <eos> king henry vi : gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me <eos> queen margaret : ay to be murder'd by his enemies <eos> prince edward : when i return with victory from the field i'll see your grace : till then i'll follow her <eos> queen margaret : come son away we may not linger thus <eos> king henry vi : poor queen <eos> how love to me and to her son hath made her break out into terms of rage <eos> revenged may she be on that hateful duke whose haughty spirit winged with desire will cost my crown and like an empty eagle tire on the flesh of me and of my son <eos> the loss of those three lords torments my heart : i'll write unto them and entreat them fair <eos> come cousin you shall be the messenger <eos> exeter : and i i hope shall reconcile them all <eos> 3 king henry vi richard : brother though i be youngest give me leave <eos> edward : no i can better play the orator <eos> montague : but i have reasons strong and forcible <eos> york : why how now sons and brother <eos> at a strife <eos> what is your quarrel <eos> how began it first <eos> edward : no quarrel but a slight contention <eos> york : about what <eos> richard : about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours <eos> york : mine boy <eos> not till king henry be dead <eos> richard : your right depends not on his life or death <eos> edward : now you are heir therefore enjoy it now : by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end <eos> york : i took an oath that he should quietly reign <eos> edward : but for a kingdom any oath may be broken : i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year <eos> richard : no god forbid your grace should be forsworn <eos> york : i shall be if i claim by open war <eos> richard : i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak <eos> york : thou canst not son it is impossible <eos> richard : an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears : henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous <eos> therefore to arms <eos> and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy <eos> why do we finger thus <eos> i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart <eos> york : richard enough i will be king or die <eos> brother thou shalt to london presently and whet on warwick to this enterprise <eos> thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk and tell him privily of our intent <eos> you edward shall unto my lord cobham with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise : in them i trust for they are soldiers witty courteous liberal full of spirit <eos> while you are thus employ'd what resteth more but that i seek occasion how to rise and yet the king not privy to my drift nor any of the house of lancaster <eos> but stay : what news <eos> why comest thou in such post <eos> messenger : the queen with all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in your castle : she is hard by with twenty thousand men and therefore fortify your hold my lord <eos> york : ay with my sword <eos> what <eos> think'st thou that we fear them <eos> edward and richard you shall stay with me my brother montague shall post to london : let noble warwick cobham and the rest whom we have left protectors of the king with powerful policy strengthen themselves and trust not simple henry nor his oaths <eos> montague : brother i go i'll win them fear it not : and thus most humbly i do take my leave <eos> sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles you are come to sandal in a happy hour the army of the queen mean to besiege us <eos> john mortimer : she shall not need we'll meet her in the field <eos> york : what with five thousand men <eos> richard : ay with five hundred father for a need : a woman's general what should we fear <eos> edward : i hear their drums : let's set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight <eos> york : five men to twenty <eos> though the odds be great i doubt not uncle of our victory <eos> many a battle have i won in france when as the enemy hath been ten to one : why should i not now have the like success <eos> 3 king henry vi rutland : ah whither shall i fly to 'scape their hands <eos> ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes <eos> clifford : chaplain away <eos> thy priesthood saves thy life <eos> as for the brat of this accursed duke whose father slew my father he shall die <eos> tutor : and i my lord will bear him company <eos> clifford : soldiers away with him <eos> tutor : ah clifford murder not this innocent child lest thou be hated both of god and man <eos> clifford : how now <eos> is he dead already <eos> or is it fear that makes him close his eyes <eos> i'll open them <eos> rutland : so looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws and so he walks insulting o'er his prey and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder <eos> ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword and not with such a cruel threatening look <eos> sweet clifford hear me speak before i die <eos> i am too mean a subject for thy wrath : be thou revenged on men and let me live <eos> clifford : in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter <eos> rutland : then let my father's blood open it again : he is a man and clifford cope with him <eos> clifford : had thy brethren here their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me no if i digg'd up thy forefathers' graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart <eos> the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul and till i root out their accursed line and leave not one alive i live in hell <eos> therefore <eos> rutland : o let me pray before i take my death <eos> to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me <eos> clifford : such pity as my rapier's point affords <eos> rutland : i never did thee harm : why wilt thou slay me <eos> clifford : thy father hath <eos> rutland : but 'twas ere i was born <eos> thou hast one son for his sake pity me lest in revenge thereof sith god is just he be as miserably slain as i <eos> ah let me live in prison all my days and when i give occasion of offence then let me die for now thou hast no cause <eos> clifford : no cause <eos> thy father slew my father therefore die <eos> rutland : di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae <eos> clifford : plantagenet <eos> i come plantagenet <eos> and this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both <eos> 3 king henry vi york : the army of the queen hath got the field : my uncles both are slain in rescuing me and all my followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves <eos> my sons god knows what hath bechanced them : but this i know they have demean'd themselves like men born to renown by life or death <eos> three times did richard make a lane to me <eos> and thrice cried 'courage father <eos> fight it out <eos>' and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encounter'd him : and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried 'charge <eos> and give no foot of ground <eos>' and cried 'a crown or else a glorious tomb <eos> a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre <eos>' with this we charged again : but out alas <eos> we bodged again as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with over-matching waves <eos> ah hark <eos> the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury : and were i strong i would not shun their fury : the sands are number'd that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end <eos> come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage : i am your butt and i abide your shot <eos> northumberland : yield to our mercy proud plantagenet <eos> clifford : ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm with downright payment show'd unto my father <eos> now phaethon hath tumbled from his car and made an evening at the noontide prick <eos> york : my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all : and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whate'er you can afflict me with <eos> why come you not <eos> what <eos> multitudes and fear <eos> clifford : so cowards fight when they can fly no further so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers <eos> york : o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought o'er-run my former time and if though canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this <eos> clifford : i will not bandy with thee word for word but buckle with thee blows twice two for one <eos> queen margaret : hold valiant clifford <eos> for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitor's life <eos> wrath makes him deaf : speak thou northumberland <eos> northumberland : hold clifford <eos> do not honour him so much to prick thy finger though to wound his heart : what valour were it when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away <eos> it is war's prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour <eos> clifford : ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin <eos> northumberland : so doth the cony struggle in the net <eos> york : so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd <eos> northumberland : what would your grace have done unto him now <eos> queen margaret : brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand <eos> what <eos> was it you that would be england's king <eos> was't you that revell'd in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent <eos> where are your mess of sons to back you now <eos> the wanton edward and the lusty george <eos> and where's that valiant crook-back prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies <eos> or with the rest where is your darling rutland <eos> look york : i stain'd this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapier's point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal <eos> alas poor york <eos> but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state <eos> i prithee grieve to make me merry york <eos> what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland's death <eos> why art thou patient man <eos> thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus <eos> stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance <eos> thou wouldst be fee'd i see to make me sport : york cannot speak unless he wear a crown <eos> a crown for york <eos> and lords bow low to him : hold you his hands whilst i do set it on <eos> ay marry sir now looks he like a king <eos> ay this is he that took king henry's chair and this is he was his adopted heir <eos> but how is it that great plantagenet is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath <eos> as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death <eos> and will you pale your head in henry's glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath <eos> o 'tis a fault too too unpardonable <eos> off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead <eos> clifford : that is my office for my father's sake <eos> queen margaret : nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes <eos> york : she-wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth <eos> how ill-beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates <eos> but that thy face is vizard-like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush <eos> to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless <eos> thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman <eos> hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult <eos> it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death <eos> 'tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small : 'tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at : 'tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable : thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion <eos> o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide <eos> how couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman's face <eos> women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless <eos> bids't thou me rage <eos> why now thou hast thy wish : wouldst have me weep <eos> why now thou hast thy will : for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins <eos> these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies : and every drop cries vengeance for his death 'gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman <eos> northumberland : beshrew me but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears <eos> york : that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood : but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania <eos> see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears : this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away <eos> keep thou the napkin and go boast of this : and if thou tell'st the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears and say 'alas it was a piteous deed <eos>' there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand <eos> hard-hearted clifford take me from the world : my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads <eos> northumberland : had he been slaughter-man to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him <eos> to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul <eos> queen margaret : what weeping-ripe my lord northumberland <eos> think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears <eos> clifford : here's for my oath here's for my father's death <eos> queen margaret : and here's to right our gentle-hearted king <eos> york : open thy gate of mercy gracious god <eos> my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee <eos> queen margaret : off with his head and set it on york gates so york may overlook the town of york <eos> 3 king henry vi edward : i wonder how our princely father 'scaped or whether he be 'scaped away or no from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit : had he been ta'en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he 'scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape <eos> how fares my brother <eos> why is he so sad <eos> richard : i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become <eos> i saw him in the battle range about and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth <eos> methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs who having pinch'd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him <eos> so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father : methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son <eos> see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun <eos> how well resembles it the prime of youth trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love <eos> edward : dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns <eos> richard : three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky <eos> see see <eos> they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vow'd some league inviolable : now are they but one lamp one light one sun <eos> in this the heaven figures some event <eos> edward : 'tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of <eos> i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and over-shine the earth as this the world <eos> whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fair-shining suns <eos> richard : nay bear three daughters : by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male <eos> but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue <eos> messenger : ah one that was a woful looker-on when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord <eos> edward : o speak no more for i have heard too much <eos> richard : say how he died for i will hear it all <eos> messenger : environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enter'd troy <eos> but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak <eos> by many hands your father was subdued but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain : and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd <eos> edward : sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay <eos> o clifford boisterous clifford <eos> thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee <eos> now my soul's palace is become a prison : ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest <eos> for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy <eos> richard : i cannot weep for all my body's moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart : nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench <eos> to weep is to make less the depth of grief : tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it <eos> edward : his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left <eos> richard : nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun : for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his <eos> warwick : how now fair lords <eos> what fare <eos> what news abroad <eos> richard : great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word's deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds <eos> o valiant lord the duke of york is slain <eos> edward : o warwick warwick <eos> that plantagenet which held three dearly as his soul's redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death <eos> warwick : ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall'n <eos> after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart <eos> i then in london keeper of the king muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought march'd toward saint alban's to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry's oath and your succession <eos> short tale to make we at saint alban's met our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought : but whether 'twas the coldness of the king who look'd full gently on his warlike queen that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether 'twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford's rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge : but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers' like the night-owl's lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends <eos> i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards : but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste post-haste are come to join with you : for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again <eos> edward : where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick <eos> and when came george from burgundy to england <eos> warwick : some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war <eos> richard : 'twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled : oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne'er till now his scandal of retire <eos> warwick : nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer <eos> richard : i know it well lord warwick blame me not : 'tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak <eos> but in this troublous time what's to be done <eos> shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our ave-maries with our beads <eos> or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms <eos> if for the last say ay and to it lords <eos> warwick : why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague <eos> attend me lords <eos> the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easy-melting king like wax <eos> he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster <eos> their power i think is thirty thousand strong : now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via <eos> to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry 'charge upon our foes <eos>' but never once again turn back and fly <eos> richard : ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak : ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries 'retire' if warwick bid him stay <eos> edward : lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail'st <eos>as god forbid the hour <eos> <eos> must edward fall which peril heaven forfend <eos> warwick : no longer earl of march but duke of york : the next degree is england's royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head <eos> king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task <eos> richard : then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine <eos> edward : then strike up drums : god and saint george for us <eos> warwick : how now <eos> what news <eos> messenger : the duke of norfolk sends you word by me the queen is coming with a puissant host and craves your company for speedy counsel <eos> warwick : why then it sorts brave warriors let's away <eos> 3 king henry vi queen margaret : welcome my lord to this brave town of york <eos> yonder's the head of that arch-enemy that sought to be encompass'd with your crown : doth not the object cheer your heart my lord <eos> king henry vi : ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck : to see this sight it irks my very soul <eos> withhold revenge dear god <eos> 'tis not my fault nor wittingly have i infringed my vow <eos> clifford : my gracious liege this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside <eos> to whom do lions cast their gentle looks <eos> not to the beast that would usurp their den <eos> whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick <eos> not his that spoils her young before her face <eos> who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting <eos> not he that sets his foot upon her back <eos> the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood <eos> ambitious york doth level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows : he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father <eos> unreasonable creatures feed their young and though man's face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climb'd unto their nest offer their own lives in their young's defence <eos> for shame my liege make them your precedent <eos> were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his father's fault and long hereafter say unto his child 'what my great-grandfather and his grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away' <eos> ah what a shame were this <eos> look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him <eos> king henry vi : full well hath clifford play'd the orator inferring arguments of mighty force <eos> but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things ill-got had ever bad success <eos> and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell <eos> i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more <eos> for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousand-fold more care to keep than in possession and jot of pleasure <eos> ah cousin york <eos> would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here <eos> queen margaret : my lord cheer up your spirits : our foes are nigh and this soft courage makes your followers faint <eos> you promised knighthood to our forward son : unsheathe your sword and dub him presently <eos> edward kneel down <eos> king henry vi : edward plantagenet arise a knight and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right <eos> prince : my gracious father by your kingly leave i'll draw it as apparent to the crown and in that quarrel use it to the death <eos> clifford : why that is spoken like a toward prince <eos> messenger : royal commanders be in readiness : for with a band of thirty thousand men comes warwick backing of the duke of york and in the towns as they do march along proclaims him king and many fly to him : darraign your battle for they are at hand <eos> clifford : i would your highness would depart the field : the queen hath best success when you are absent <eos> queen margaret : ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune <eos> king henry vi : why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay <eos> northumberland : be it with resolution then to fight <eos> prince edward : my royal father cheer these noble lords and hearten those that fight in your defence : unsheathe your sword good father cry 'saint george <eos>' edward : now perjured henry <eos> wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field <eos> queen margaret : go rate thy minions proud insulting boy <eos> becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king <eos> edward : i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent : since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in <eos> clifford : and reason too : who should succeed the father but the son <eos> richard : are you there butcher <eos> o i cannot speak <eos> clifford : ay crook-back here i stand to answer thee or any he the proudest of thy sort <eos> richard : 'twas you that kill'd young rutland was it not <eos> clifford : ay and old york and yet not satisfied <eos> richard : for god's sake lords give signal to the fight <eos> warwick : what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield the crown <eos> queen margaret : why how now long-tongued warwick <eos> dare you speak <eos> when you and i met at saint alban's last your legs did better service than your hands <eos> warwick : then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine <eos> clifford : you said so much before and yet you fled <eos> warwick : 'twas not your valour clifford drove me thence <eos> northumberland : no nor your manhood that durst make you stay <eos> richard : northumberland i hold thee reverently <eos> break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my big-swoln heart upon that clifford that cruel child-killer <eos> clifford : i slew thy father call'st thou him a child <eos> richard : ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed <eos> king henry vi : have done with words my lords and hear me speak <eos> queen margaret : defy them then or else hold close thy lips <eos> king henry vi : i prithee give no limits to my tongue : i am a king and privileged to speak <eos> clifford : my liege the wound that bred this meeting here cannot be cured by words therefore be still <eos> richard : then executioner unsheathe thy sword : by him that made us all i am resolved that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue <eos> edward : say henry shall i have my right or no <eos> a thousand men have broke their fasts to-day that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown <eos> warwick : if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armour on <eos> prince edward : if that be right which warwick says is right there is no wrong but every thing is right <eos> richard : whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue <eos> queen margaret : but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic mark'd by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings <eos> richard : iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king <eos> as if a channel should be call'd the sea <eos> shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart <eos> edward : a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself <eos> helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'd by that false woman as this king by thee <eos> his father revell'd in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he match'd according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france and heap'd sedition on his crown at home <eos> for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride <eos> hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipp'd our claim until another age <eos> george : but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring and that thy summer bred us no increase we set the axe to thy usurping root and though the edge hath something hit ourselves yet know thou since we have begun to strike we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods <eos> edward : and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou deniest the gentle king to speak <eos> sound trumpets <eos> let our bloody colours wave <eos> and either victory or else a grave <eos> queen margaret : stay edward <eos> edward : no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay : these words will cost ten thousand lives this day <eos> 3 king henry vi warwick : forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes received and many blows repaid have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile <eos> edward : smile gentle heaven <eos> or strike ungentle death <eos> for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded <eos> warwick : how now my lord <eos> what hap <eos> what hope of good <eos> george : our hap is loss our hope but sad despair our ranks are broke and ruin follows us : what counsel give you <eos> whither shall we fly <eos> edward : bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit <eos> richard : ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself <eos> thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangour heard from far 'warwick revenge <eos> brother revenge my death <eos>' so underneath the belly of their steeds that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost <eos> warwick : then let the earth be drunken with our blood : i'll kill my horse because i will not fly <eos> why stand we like soft-hearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors <eos> here on my knee i vow to god above i'll never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge <eos> edward : o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine <eos> and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with they will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul <eos> now lords take leave until we meet again where'er it be in heaven or in earth <eos> richard : brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms : i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our spring-time so <eos> warwick : away away <eos> once more sweet lords farewell <eos> george : yet let us all together to our troops and give them leave to fly that will not stay and call them pillars that will stand to us and if we thrive promise them such rewards as victors wear at the olympian games : this may plant courage in their quailing breasts for yet is hope of life and victory <eos> forslow no longer make we hence amain <eos> 3 king henry vi richard : now clifford i have singled thee alone : suppose this arm is for the duke of york and this for rutland both bound to revenge wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall <eos> clifford : now richard i am with thee here alone : this is the hand that stabb'd thy father york and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland and here's the heart that triumphs in their death and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother to execute the like upon thyself and so have at thee <eos> richard : nay warwick single out some other chase for i myself will hunt this wolf to death <eos> 3 king henry vi king henry vi : this battle fares like to the morning's war when dying clouds contend with growing light what time the shepherd blowing of his nails can neither call it perfect day nor night <eos> now sways it this way like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind now sways it that way like the selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind : sometime the flood prevails and then the wind now one the better then another best both tugging to be victors breast to breast yet neither conqueror nor conquered : so is the equal of this fell war <eos> here on this molehill will i sit me down <eos> to whom god will there be the victory <eos> for margaret my queen and clifford too have chid me from the battle swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence <eos> would i were dead <eos> if god's good will were so for what is in this world but grief and woe <eos> o god <eos> methinks it were a happy life to be no better than a homely swain to sit upon a hill as i do now to carve out dials quaintly point by point thereby to see the minutes how they run how many make the hour full complete how many hours bring about the day how many days will finish up the year how many years a mortal man may live <eos> when this is known then to divide the times : so many hours must i tend my flock so many hours must i take my rest so many hours must i contemplate so many hours must i sport myself so many days my ewes have been with young so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean : so many years ere i shall shear the fleece : so minutes hours days months and years pass'd over to the end they were created would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave <eos> ah what a life were this <eos> how sweet <eos> how lovely <eos> gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep than doth a rich embroider'd canopy to kings that fear their subjects' treachery <eos> o yes it doth a thousand-fold it doth <eos> and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle <eos> his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade all which secure and sweetly he enjoys is far beyond a prince's delicates his viands sparkling in a golden cup his body couched in a curious bed when care mistrust and treason waits on him <eos> son : ill blows the wind that profits nobody <eos> this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight may be possessed with some store of crowns and i that haply take them from him now may yet ere night yield both my life and them to some man else as this dead man doth me <eos> who's this <eos> o god <eos> it is my father's face whom in this conflict i unwares have kill'd <eos> o heavy times begetting such events <eos> from london by the king was i press'd forth my father being the earl of warwick's man came on the part of york press'd by his master and i who at his hands received my life him have by my hands of life bereaved him <eos> pardon me god i knew not what i did <eos> and pardon father for i knew not thee <eos> my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks and no more words till they have flow'd their fill <eos> king henry vi : o piteous spectacle <eos> o bloody times <eos> whiles lions war and battle for their dens poor harmless lambs abide their enmity <eos> weep wretched man i'll aid thee tear for tear and let our hearts and eyes like civil war be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief <eos> father : thou that so stoutly hast resisted me give me thy gold if thou hast any gold : for i have bought it with an hundred blows <eos> but let me see : is this our foeman's face <eos> ah no no no it is mine only son <eos> ah boy if any life be left in thee throw up thine eye <eos> see see what showers arise blown with the windy tempest of my heart upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart <eos> o pity god this miserable age <eos> what stratagems how fell how butcherly erroneous mutinous and unnatural this deadly quarrel daily doth beget <eos> o boy thy father gave thee life too soon and hath bereft thee of thy life too late <eos> king henry vi : woe above woe <eos> grief more than common grief <eos> o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds <eos> o pity pity gentle heaven pity <eos> the red rose and the white are on his face the fatal colours of our striving houses : the one his purple blood right well resembles the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth : wither one rose and let the other flourish if you contend a thousand lives must wither <eos> son : how will my mother for a father's death take on with me and ne'er be satisfied <eos> father : how will my wife for slaughter of my son shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied <eos> king henry vi : how will the country for these woful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied <eos> son : was ever son so rued a father's death <eos> father : was ever father so bemoan'd his son <eos> king henry vi : was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe <eos> much is your sorrow mine ten times so much <eos> son : i'll bear thee hence where i may weep my fill <eos> father : these arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell and so obsequious will thy father be even for the loss of thee having no more as priam was for all his valiant sons <eos> i'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will for i have murdered where i should not kill <eos> king henry vi : sad-hearted men much overgone with care here sits a king more woful than you are <eos> prince edward : fly father fly <eos> for all your friends are fled and warwick rages like a chafed bull : away <eos> for death doth hold us in pursuit <eos> queen margaret : mount you my lord towards berwick post amain : edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds having the fearful flying hare in sight with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath and bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands are at our backs and therefore hence amain <eos> exeter : away <eos> for vengeance comes along with them : nay stay not to expostulate make speed or else come after : i'll away before <eos> king henry vi : nay take me with thee good sweet exeter : not that i fear to stay but love to go whither the queen intends <eos> forward away <eos> 3 king henry vi clifford : here burns my candle out ay here it dies which whiles it lasted gave king henry light <eos> o lancaster i fear thy overthrow more than my body's parting with my soul <eos> my love and fear glued many friends to thee and now i fall thy tough commixture melts <eos> impairing henry strengthening misproud york the common people swarm like summer flies and whither fly the gnats but to the sun <eos> and who shines now but henry's enemies <eos> o phoebus hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth <eos> and henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do or as thy father and his father did giving no ground unto the house of york they never then had sprung like summer flies i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace <eos> for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air <eos> and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity <eos> bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight : the foe is merciless and will not pity for at their hands i have deserved no pity <eos> the air hath got into my deadly wounds and much effuse of blood doth make me faint <eos> come york and richard warwick and the rest i stabb'd your fathers' bosoms split my breast <eos> edward : now breathe we lords : good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks <eos> some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves <eos> but think you lords that clifford fled with them <eos> warwick : no 'tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard mark'd him for the grave : and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead <eos> edward : whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave <eos> richard : a deadly groan like life and death's departing <eos> edward : see who it is : and now the battle's ended if friend or foe let him be gently used <eos> richard : revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis clifford who not contented that he lopp'd the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york <eos> warwick : from off the gates of york fetch down the head your father's head which clifford placed there instead whereof let this supply the room : measure for measure must be answered <eos> edward : bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours : now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak <eos> warwick : i think his understanding is bereft <eos> speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee <eos> dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say <eos> richard : o would he did <eos> and so perhaps he doth : 'tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father <eos> george : if so thou think'st vex him with eager words <eos> richard : clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace <eos> edward : clifford repent in bootless penitence <eos> warwick : clifford devise excuses for thy faults <eos> george : while we devise fell tortures for thy faults <eos> richard : thou didst love york and i am son to york <eos> edward : thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee <eos> george : where's captain margaret to fence you now <eos> warwick : they mock thee clifford : swear as thou wast wont <eos> richard : what not an oath <eos> nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath <eos> i know by that he's dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy two hour's life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy <eos> warwick : ay but he's dead : off with the traitor's head and rear it in the place your father's stands <eos> and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned england's royal king : from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen : so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears <eos> first will i see the coronation and then to brittany i'll cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord <eos> edward : even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting <eos> richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence : warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best <eos> richard : let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous <eos> warwick : tut that's a foolish observation : richard be duke of gloucester <eos> now to london to see these honours in possession <eos> 3 king henry vi first keeper : under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves for through this laund anon the deer will come and in this covert will we make our stand culling the principal of all the deer <eos> second keeper : i'll stay above the hill so both may shoot <eos> first keeper : that cannot be the noise of thy cross-bow will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost <eos> here stand we both and aim we at the best : and for the time shall not seem tedious i'll tell thee what befell me on a day in this self-place where now we mean to stand <eos> second keeper : here comes a man let's stay till he be past <eos> king henry vi : from scotland am i stol'n even of pure love to greet mine own land with my wishful sight <eos> no harry harry 'tis no land of thine thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed : no bending knee will call thee caesar now no humble suitors press to speak for right no not a man comes for redress of thee for how can i help them and not myself <eos> first keeper : ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee : this is the quondam king let's seize upon him <eos> king henry vi : let me embrace thee sour adversity for wise men say it is the wisest course <eos> second keeper : why linger we <eos> let us lay hands upon him <eos> first keeper : forbear awhile we'll hear a little more <eos> king henry vi : my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french king's sister to wife for edward : if this news be true poor queen and son your labour is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words <eos> by this account then margaret may win him for she's a woman to be pitied much : her sighs will make a battery in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears <eos> ay but she's come to beg warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward <eos> she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is install'd that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edward's place <eos> o margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn <eos> second keeper : say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens <eos> king henry vi : more than i seem and less than i was born to : a man at least for less i should not be and men may talk of kings and why not i <eos> second keeper : ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king <eos> king henry vi : why so i am in mind and that's enough <eos> second keeper : but if thou be a king where is thy crown <eos> king henry vi : my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen : my crown is called content : a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy <eos> second keeper : well if you be a king crown'd with content your crown content and you must be contented to go along with us for as we think you are the king king edward hath deposed and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance will apprehend you as his enemy <eos> king henry vi : but did you never swear and break an oath <eos> second keeper : no never such an oath nor will not now <eos> king henry vi : where did you dwell when i was king of england <eos> second keeper : here in this country where we now remain <eos> king henry vi : i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me : and tell me then have you not broke your oaths <eos> first keeper : no for we were subjects but while you were king <eos> king henry vi : why am i dead <eos> do i not breathe a man <eos> ah simple men you know not what you swear <eos> look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men <eos> but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty <eos> go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and i'll obey <eos> first keeper : we are true subjects to the king king edward <eos> king henry vi : so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is <eos> first keeper : we charge you in god's name and the king's to go with us unto the officers <eos> king henry vi : in god's name lead your king's name be obey'd : and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto <eos> 3 king henry vi king edward iv : brother of gloucester at saint alban's field this lady's husband sir richard grey was slain his lands then seized on by the conqueror : her suit is now to repossess those lands which we in justice cannot well deny because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life <eos> gloucester : your highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonour to deny it her <eos> king edward iv : it were no less but yet i'll make a pause <eos> gloucester : clarence : gloucester : king edward iv : widow we will consider of your suit and come some other time to know our mind <eos> lady grey : right gracious lord i cannot brook delay : may it please your highness to resolve me now and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me <eos> gloucester : clarence : gloucester : king edward iv : how many children hast thou widow <eos> tell me <eos> clarence : gloucester : lady grey : three my most gracious lord <eos> gloucester : king edward iv : 'twere pity they should lose their father's lands <eos> lady grey : be pitiful dread lord and grant it then <eos> king edward iv : lords give us leave : i'll try this widow's wit <eos> gloucester : king edward iv : now tell me madam do you love your children <eos> lady grey : ay full as dearly as i love myself <eos> king edward iv : and would you not do much to do them good <eos> lady grey : to do them good i would sustain some harm <eos> king edward iv : then get your husband's lands to do them good <eos> lady grey : therefore i came unto your majesty <eos> king edward iv : i'll tell you how these lands are to be got <eos> lady grey : so shall you bind me to your highness' service <eos> king edward iv : what service wilt thou do me if i give them <eos> lady grey : what you command that rests in me to do <eos> king edward iv : but you will take exceptions to my boon <eos> lady grey : no gracious lord except i cannot do it <eos> king edward iv : ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask <eos> lady grey : why then i will do what your grace commands <eos> gloucester : clarence : lady grey : why stops my lord shall i not hear my task <eos> king edward iv : an easy task 'tis but to love a king <eos> lady grey : that's soon perform'd because i am a subject <eos> king edward iv : why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee <eos> lady grey : i take my leave with many thousand thanks <eos> gloucester : king edward iv : but stay thee 'tis the fruits of love i mean <eos> lady grey : the fruits of love i mean my loving liege <eos> king edward iv : ay but i fear me in another sense <eos> what love think'st thou i sue so much to get <eos> lady grey : my love till death my humble thanks my prayers that love which virtue begs and virtue grants <eos> king edward iv : no by my troth i did not mean such love <eos> lady grey : why then you mean not as i thought you did <eos> king edward iv : but now you partly may perceive my mind <eos> lady grey : my mind will never grant what i perceive your highness aims at if i aim aright <eos> king edward iv : to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee <eos> lady grey : to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison <eos> king edward iv : why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands <eos> lady grey : why then mine honesty shall be my dower for by that loss i will not purchase them <eos> king edward iv : therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily <eos> lady grey : herein your highness wrongs both them and me <eos> but mighty lord this merry inclination accords not with the sadness of my suit : please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no <eos>' king edward iv : ay if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request no if thou dost say 'no' to my demand <eos> lady grey : then no my lord <eos> my suit is at an end <eos> gloucester : clarence : king edward iv : lady grey : 'tis better said than done my gracious lord : i am a subject fit to jest withal but far unfit to be a sovereign <eos> king edward iv : sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love <eos> lady grey : and that is more than i will yield unto : i know i am too mean to be your queen and yet too good to be your concubine <eos> king edward iv : you cavil widow : i did mean my queen <eos> lady grey : 'twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father <eos> king edward iv : no more than when my daughters call thee mother <eos> thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by god's mother i being but a bachelor have other some : why 'tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons <eos> answer no more for thou shalt be my queen <eos> gloucester : clarence : king edward iv : brothers you muse what chat we two have had <eos> gloucester : the widow likes it not for she looks very sad <eos> king edward iv : you'll think it strange if i should marry her <eos> clarence : to whom my lord <eos> king edward iv : why clarence to myself <eos> gloucester : that would be ten days' wonder at the least <eos> clarence : that's a day longer than a wonder lasts <eos> gloucester : by so much is the wonder in extremes <eos> king edward iv : well jest on brothers : i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband's lands <eos> nobleman : my gracious lord henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gate <eos> king edward iv : see that he be convey'd unto the tower : and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension <eos> widow go you along <eos> lords use her honourably <eos> gloucester : ay edward will use women honourably <eos> would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for <eos> and yet between my soul's desire and me <eos> the lustful edward's title buried <eos> is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself : a cold premeditation for my purpose <eos> why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far-off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he'll lade it dry to have his way : so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i'll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities <eos> my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them <eos> well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford <eos> i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks <eos> o miserable thought <eos> and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns <eos> why love forswore me in my mother's womb : and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear-whelp that carries no impression like the dam <eos> and am i then a man to be beloved <eos> o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought <eos> then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to cheque to o'erbear such as are of better person than myself i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live to account this world but hell until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown <eos> and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home : and i <eos>like one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out <eos> torment myself to catch the english crown : and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe <eos> why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry 'content' to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions <eos> i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk i'll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy <eos> i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school <eos> can i do this and cannot get a crown <eos> tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down <eos> 3 king henry vi king lewis xi : fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us : it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit <eos> queen margaret : no mighty king of france : now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command <eos> i was i must confess great albion's queen in former golden days : but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself <eos> king lewis xi : why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair <eos> queen margaret : from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares <eos> king lewis xi : whate'er it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side : yield not thy neck to fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance <eos> be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eased if france can yield relief <eos> queen margaret : those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak <eos> now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banish'd man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england's true-anointed lawful king <eos> this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henry's heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done : scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight <eos> king lewis xi : renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off <eos> queen margaret : the more we stay the stronger grows our foe <eos> king lewis xi : the more i stay the more i'll succor thee <eos> queen margaret : o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow <eos> and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow <eos> king lewis xi : what's he approacheth boldly to our presence <eos> queen margaret : our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend <eos> king lewis xi : welcome brave warwick <eos> what brings thee to france <eos> queen margaret : ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide <eos> warwick : from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england's king in lawful marriage <eos> queen margaret : warwick : queen margaret : king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick <eos> his demand springs not from edward's well-meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance <eos> to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still : but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry's son <eos> look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs <eos> warwick : injurious margaret <eos> prince edward : and why not queen <eos> warwick : because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen <eos> oxford : then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france : from these our henry lineally descends <eos> warwick : oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten <eos> methinks these peers of france should smile at that <eos> but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom's worth <eos> oxford : why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush <eos> warwick : can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree <eos> for shame <eos> leave henry and call edward king <eos> oxford : call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death <eos> and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellow'd years when nature brought him to the door of death <eos> no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster <eos> warwick : and i the house of york <eos> king lewis xi : queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick <eos> queen margaret : heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not <eos> king lewis xi : now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king <eos> for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen <eos> warwick : thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour <eos> king lewis xi : but is he gracious in the people's eye <eos> warwick : the more that henry was unfortunate <eos> king lewis xi : then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona <eos> warwick : such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself <eos> myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain <eos> king lewis xi : now sister let us hear your firm resolve <eos> bona : your grant or your denial shall be mine : yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your king's desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire <eos> king lewis xi : then warwick thus : our sister shall be edward's and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoised <eos> draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king <eos> prince edward : to edward but not to the english king <eos> queen margaret : deceitful warwick <eos> it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit : before thy coming lewis was henry's friend <eos> king lewis xi : and still is friend to him and margaret : but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edward's good success then 'tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised <eos> yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield <eos> warwick : henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose <eos> and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better 'twere you troubled him than france <eos> queen margaret : peace impudent and shameless warwick peace proud setter up and puller down of kings <eos> i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather <eos> king lewis xi : warwick this is some post to us or thee <eos> post : oxford : i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his <eos> prince edward : nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled : i hope all's for the best <eos> king lewis xi : warwick what are thy news <eos> and yours fair queen <eos> queen margaret : mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys <eos> warwick : mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent <eos> king lewis xi : what <eos> has your king married the lady grey <eos> and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience <eos> is this the alliance that he seeks with france <eos> dare he presume to scorn us in this manner <eos> queen margaret : i told your majesty as much before : this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty <eos> warwick : king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame <eos> did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death <eos> did i let pass the abuse done to my niece <eos> did i impale him with the regal crown <eos> did i put henry from his native right <eos> and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame <eos> shame on himself <eos> for my desert is honour : and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry <eos> my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor : i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state <eos> queen margaret : warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomest king henry's friend <eos> warwick : so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i'll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war <eos> 'tis not his new-made bride shall succor him : and as for clarence as my letters tell me he's very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country <eos> bona : dear brother how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen <eos> queen margaret : renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair <eos> bona : my quarrel and this english queen's are one <eos> warwick : and mine fair lady bona joins with yours <eos> king lewis xi : and mine with hers and thine and margaret's <eos> therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid <eos> queen margaret : let me give humble thanks for all at once <eos> king lewis xi : then england's messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride : thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal <eos> bona : tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly i'll wear the willow garland for his sake <eos> queen margaret : tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on <eos> warwick : tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long <eos> there's thy reward : be gone <eos> king lewis xi : but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply <eos> yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty <eos> warwick : this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands <eos> queen margaret : yes i agree and thank you for your motion <eos> son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwick's daughter shall be thine <eos> prince edward : yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand <eos> king lewis xi : why stay we now <eos> these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shalt waft them over with our royal fleet <eos> i long till edward fall by war's mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france <eos> warwick : i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe : matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand <eos> had he none else to make a stale but me <eos> then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow <eos> i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i'll be chief to bring him down again : not that i pity henry's misery but seek revenge on edward's mockery <eos> 3 king henry vi gloucester : now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey <eos> hath not our brother made a worthy choice <eos> clarence : alas you know 'tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return <eos> somerset : my lords forbear this talk here comes the king <eos> gloucester : and his well-chosen bride <eos> clarence : i mind to tell him plainly what i think <eos> king edward iv : now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent <eos> clarence : as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they'll take no offence at our abuse <eos> king edward iv : suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick : i am edward your king and warwick's and must have my will <eos> gloucester : and shall have your will because our king : yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well <eos> king edward iv : yea brother richard are you offended too <eos> gloucester : not i : no god forbid that i should wish them sever'd whom god hath join'd together ay and 'twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together <eos> king edward iv : setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england's queen <eos> and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think <eos> clarence : then this is mine opinion : that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona <eos> gloucester : and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage <eos> king edward iv : what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise <eos> montague : yet to have join'd with france in such alliance would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth 'gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage <eos> hastings : why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself <eos> montague : but the safer when 'tis back'd with france <eos> hastings : 'tis better using france than trusting france : let us be back'd with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies <eos> clarence : for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford <eos> king edward iv : ay what of that <eos> it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law <eos> gloucester : and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence : but in your bride you bury brotherhood <eos> clarence : or else you would not have bestow'd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife's son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere <eos> king edward iv : alas poor clarence <eos> is it for a wife that thou art malcontent <eos> i will provide thee <eos> clarence : in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment which being shallow you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you <eos> king edward iv : leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother's will <eos> queen elizabeth : my lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune <eos> but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow <eos> king edward iv : my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns : what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey <eos> nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath <eos> gloucester : king edward iv : now messenger what letters or what news from france <eos> post : my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate <eos> king edward iv : go to we pardon thee : therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them <eos> what answer makes king lewis unto our letters <eos> post : at my depart these were his very words : 'go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride <eos>' king edward iv : is lewis so brave <eos> belike he thinks me henry <eos> but what said lady bona to my marriage <eos> post : these were her words utter'd with mad disdain : 'tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly i'll wear the willow garland for his sake <eos>' king edward iv : i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong <eos> but what said henry's queen <eos> for i have heard that she was there in place <eos> post : 'tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on <eos>' king edward iv : belike she minds to play the amazon <eos> but what said warwick to these injuries <eos> post : he more incensed against your majesty than all the rest discharged me with these words : 'tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long <eos>' king edward iv : ha <eos> durst the traitor breathe out so proud words <eos> well i will arm me being thus forewarn'd : they shall have wars and pay for their presumption <eos> but say is warwick friends with margaret <eos> post : ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick's daughter <eos> clarence : belike the elder clarence will have the younger <eos> now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick's other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself <eos> you that love me and warwick follow me <eos> gloucester : king edward iv : clarence and somerset both gone to warwick <eos> yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case <eos> pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed : myself in person will straight follow you <eos> but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt <eos> you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance : tell me if you love warwick more than me <eos> if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends : but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect <eos> montague : so god help montague as he proves true <eos> hastings : and hastings as he favours edward's cause <eos> king edward iv : now brother richard will you stand by us <eos> gloucester : ay in despite of all that shall withstand you <eos> king edward iv : why so <eos> then am i sure of victory <eos> now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power <eos> 3 king henry vi warwick : trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us <eos> but see where somerset and clarence come <eos> speak suddenly my lords are we all friends <eos> clarence : fear not that my lord <eos> warwick : then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset : i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward's brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings : but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine <eos> and now what rests but in night's coverture thy brother being carelessly encamp'd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure <eos> our scouts have found the adventure very easy : that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well cover'd with the night's black mantle at unawares may beat down edward's guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him <eos> you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader <eos> why then let's on our way in silent sort : for warwick and his friends god and saint george <eos> 3 king henry vi first watchman : come on my masters each man take his stand : the king by this is set him down to sleep <eos> second watchman : what will he not to bed <eos> first watchman : why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd <eos> second watchman : to-morrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report <eos> third watchman : but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent <eos> first watchman : 'tis the lord hastings the king's chiefest friend <eos> third watchman : o is it so <eos> but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field <eos> second watchman : 'tis the more honour because more dangerous <eos> third watchman : ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honour <eos> if warwick knew in what estate he stands 'tis to be doubted he would waken him <eos> first watchman : unless our halberds did shut up his passage <eos> second watchman : ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from night-foes <eos> warwick : this is his tent and see where stand his guard <eos> courage my masters <eos> honour now or never <eos> but follow me and edward shall be ours <eos> first watchman : who goes there <eos> second watchman : stay or thou diest <eos> somerset : what are they that fly there <eos> warwick : richard and hastings : let them go here is the duke <eos> king edward iv : the duke <eos> why warwick when we parted thou call'dst me king <eos> warwick : ay but the case is alter'd : when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york <eos> alas <eos> how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people's welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies <eos> king edward iv : yea brother of clarence are thou here too <eos> nay then i see that edward needs must down <eos> yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king : though fortune's malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel <eos> warwick : then for his mind be edward england's king : but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow <eos> my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd unto my brother archbishop of york <eos> when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i'll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him <eos> now for a while farewell good duke of york <eos> king edward iv : what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide <eos> oxford : what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers <eos> warwick : ay that's the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne <eos> 3 king henry vi rivers : madam what makes you in this sudden change <eos> queen elizabeth : why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befall'n king edward <eos> rivers : what <eos> loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick <eos> queen elizabeth : no but the loss of his own royal person <eos> rivers : then is my sovereign slain <eos> queen elizabeth : ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner either betray'd by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares : and as i further have to understand is new committed to the bishop of york fell warwick's brother and by that our foe <eos> rivers : these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may : warwick may lose that now hath won the day <eos> queen elizabeth : till then fair hope must hinder life's decay <eos> and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edward's offspring in my womb : this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edward's fruit true heir to the english crown <eos> rivers : but madam where is warwick then become <eos> queen elizabeth : i am inform'd that he comes towards london to set the crown once more on henry's head : guess thou the rest king edward's friends must down but to prevent the tyrant's violence <eos> for trust not him that hath once broken faith <eos> i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary to save at least the heir of edward's right : there shall i rest secure from force and fraud <eos> come therefore let us fly while we may fly : if warwick take us we are sure to die <eos> 3 king henry vi gloucester : now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park <eos> thus stands the case : you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself <eos> i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity <eos> huntsman : this way my lord for this way lies the game <eos> king edward iv : nay this way man : see where the huntsmen stand <eos> now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer <eos> gloucester : brother the time and case requireth haste : your horse stands ready at the park-corner <eos> king edward iv : but whither shall we then <eos> hastings : to lynn my lord and ship from thence to flanders <eos> gloucester : well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning <eos> king edward iv : stanley i will requite thy forwardness <eos> gloucester : but wherefore stay we <eos> 'tis no time to talk <eos> king edward iv : huntsman what say'st thou <eos> wilt thou go along <eos> huntsman : better do so than tarry and be hang'd <eos> gloucester : come then away let's ha' no more ado <eos> king edward iv : bishop farewell : shield thee from warwick's frown and pray that i may repossess the crown <eos> 3 king henry vi king henry vi : master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turn'd my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees <eos> lieutenant : subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majesty <eos> king henry vi : for what lieutenant <eos> for well using me <eos> nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty <eos> but warwick after god thou set'st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument <eos> therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessed land may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds <eos> warwick : your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune's malice for few men rightly temper with the stars : yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place <eos> clarence : no warwick thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent <eos> warwick : and i choose clarence only for protector <eos> king henry vi : warwick and clarence give me both your hands : now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government : i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise <eos> warwick : what answers clarence to his sovereign's will <eos> clarence : that he consents if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself <eos> warwick : why then though loath yet must i be content : we'll yoke together like a double shadow to henry's body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease <eos> and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate <eos> clarence : what else <eos> and that succession be determined <eos> warwick : ay therein clarence shall not want his part <eos> king henry vi : but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed <eos> clarence : it shall be done my sovereign with all speed <eos> king henry vi : my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care <eos> somerset : my liege it is young henry earl of richmond <eos> king henry vi : come hither england's hope <eos> if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss <eos> his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a sceptre and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne <eos> make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me <eos> warwick : what news my friend <eos> post : that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundy <eos> warwick : unsavoury news <eos> but how made he escape <eos> post : he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him for hunting was his daily exercise <eos> warwick : my brother was too careless of his charge <eos> but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide <eos> somerset : my lord i like not of this flight of edward's for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars before 't be long <eos> as henry's late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and ours : therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity <eos> oxford : ay for if edward repossess the crown 'tis like that richmond with the rest shall down <eos> somerset : it shall be so he shall to brittany <eos> come therefore let's about it speedily <eos> 3 king henry vi king edward iv : now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my waned state for henry's regal crown <eos> well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas and brought desired help from burgundy : what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom <eos> gloucester : the gates made fast <eos> brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within <eos> king edward iv : tush man abodements must not now affright us : by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us <eos> hastings : my liege i'll knock once more to summon them <eos> mayor : my lords we were forewarned of your coming and shut the gates for safety of ourselves for now we owe allegiance unto henry <eos> king edward iv : but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york <eos> mayor : true my good lord i know you for no less <eos> king edward iv : why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone <eos> gloucester : hastings : why master mayor why stand you in a doubt <eos> open the gates we are king henry's friends <eos> mayor : ay say you so <eos> the gates shall then be open'd <eos> gloucester : a wise stout captain and soon persuaded <eos> hastings : the good old man would fain that all were well so 'twere not 'long of him but being enter'd i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason <eos> king edward iv : so master mayor : these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war <eos> what <eos> fear not man but yield me up the keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me <eos> gloucester : brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived <eos> king edward iv : welcome sir john <eos> but why come you in arms <eos> montague : to help king edward in his time of storm as every loyal subject ought to do <eos> king edward iv : thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest <eos> montague : then fare you well for i will hence again : i came to serve a king and not a duke <eos> drummer strike up and let us march away <eos> king edward iv : nay stay sir john awhile and we'll debate by what safe means the crown may be recover'd <eos> montague : what talk you of debating <eos> in few words if you'll not here proclaim yourself our king i'll leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succor you : why shall we fight if you pretend no title <eos> gloucester : why brother wherefore stand you on nice points <eos> king edward iv : when we grow stronger then we'll make our claim : till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning <eos> hastings : away with scrupulous wit <eos> now arms must rule <eos> gloucester : and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns <eos> brother we will proclaim you out of hand : the bruit thereof will bring you many friends <eos> king edward iv : then be it as you will for 'tis my right and henry but usurps the diadem <eos> montague : ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself and now will i be edward's champion <eos> hastings : sound trumpet edward shall be here proclaim'd : come fellow-soldier make thou proclamation <eos> soldier : edward the fourth by the grace of god king of england and france and lord of ireland &c <eos> montague : and whosoe'er gainsays king edward's right by this i challenge him to single fight <eos> all : long live edward the fourth <eos> king edward iv : thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all : if fortune serve me i'll requite this kindness <eos> now for this night let's harbour here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon we'll forward towards warwick and his mates for well i wot that henry is no soldier <eos> ah froward clarence <eos> how evil it beseems thee to flatter henry and forsake thy brother <eos> yet as we may we'll meet both thee and warwick <eos> come on brave soldiers : doubt not of the day and that once gotten doubt not of large pay <eos> 3 king henry vi warwick : what counsel lords <eos> edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him <eos> king henry vi : let's levy men and beat him back again <eos> clarence : a little fire is quickly trodden out which being suffer'd rivers cannot quench <eos> warwick : in warwickshire i have true-hearted friends not mutinous in peace yet bold in war those will i muster up : and thou son clarence shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent the knights and gentlemen to come with thee : thou brother montague in buckingham northampton and in leicestershire shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou command'st : and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends <eos> my sovereign with the loving citizens like to his island girt in with the ocean or modest dian circled with her nymphs shall rest in london till we come to him <eos> fair lords take leave and stand not to reply <eos> farewell my sovereign <eos> king henry vi : farewell my hector and my troy's true hope <eos> clarence : in sign of truth i kiss your highness' hand <eos> king henry vi : well-minded clarence be thou fortunate <eos> montague : comfort my lord and so i take my leave <eos> oxford : and thus i seal my truth and bid adieu <eos> king henry vi : sweet oxford and my loving montague and all at once once more a happy farewell <eos> warwick : farewell sweet lords : let's meet at coventry <eos> king henry vi : here at the palace i will rest awhile <eos> cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship <eos> methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine <eos> exeter : the doubt is that he will seduce the rest <eos> king henry vi : that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame : i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs my mercy dried their water-flowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies <eos> nor forward of revenge though they much err'd : then why should they love edward more than me <eos> no exeter these graces challenge grace : and when the lion fawns upon the lamb the lamb will never cease to follow him <eos> exeter : hark hark my lord <eos> what shouts are these <eos> king edward iv : seize on the shame-faced henry bear him hence and once again proclaim us king of england <eos> you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow : now stops thy spring my sea sha$l suck them dry and swell so much the higher by their ebb <eos> hence with him to the tower let him not speak <eos> and lords towards coventry bend we our course where peremptory warwick now remains : the sun shines hot and if we use delay cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay <eos> gloucester : away betimes before his forces join and take the great-grown traitor unawares : brave warriors march amain towards coventry <eos> 3 king henry vi warwick : where is the post that came from valiant oxford <eos> how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow <eos> first messenger : by this at dunsmore marching hitherward <eos> warwick : how far off is our brother montague <eos> where is the post that came from montague <eos> second messenger : by this at daintry with a puissant troop <eos> warwick : say somerville what says my loving son <eos> and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now <eos> somerset : at southam i did leave him with his forces and do expect him here some two hours hence <eos> warwick : then clarence is at hand i hear his drum <eos> somerset : it is not his my lord here southam lies : the drum your honour hears marcheth from warwick <eos> warwick : who should that be <eos> belike unlook'd-for friends <eos> somerset : they are at hand and you shall quickly know <eos> king edward iv : go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle <eos> gloucester : see how the surly warwick mans the wall <eos> warwick : o unbid spite <eos> is sportful edward come <eos> where slept our scouts or how are they seduced that we could hear no news of his repair <eos> king edward iv : now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee call edward king and at his hands beg mercy <eos> and he shall pardon thee these outrages <eos> warwick : nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own call warwick patron and be penitent <eos> and thou shalt still remain the duke of york <eos> gloucester : i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will <eos> warwick : is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift <eos> gloucester : ay by my faith for a poor earl to give : i'll do thee service for so good a gift <eos> warwick : 'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother <eos> king edward iv : why then 'tis mine if but by warwick's gift <eos> warwick : thou art no atlas for so great a weight : and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject <eos> king edward iv : but warwick's king is edward's prisoner : and gallant warwick do but answer this : what is the body when the head is off <eos> gloucester : alas that warwick had no more forecast but whiles he thought to steal the single ten the king was slily finger'd from the deck <eos> you left poor henry at the bishop's palace and ten to one you'll meet him in the tower <eos> edward : 'tis even so yet you are warwick still <eos> gloucester : come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down : nay when <eos> strike now or else the iron cools <eos> warwick : i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee <eos> king edward iv : sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend this hand fast wound about thy coal-black hair shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off write in the dust this sentence with thy blood 'wind-changing warwick now can change no more <eos>' warwick : o cheerful colours <eos> see where oxford comes <eos> oxford : oxford oxford for lancaster <eos> gloucester : the gates are open let us enter too <eos> king edward iv : so other foes may set upon our backs <eos> stand we in good array for they no doubt will issue out again and bid us battle : if not the city being but of small defence we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same <eos> warwick : o welcome oxford <eos> for we want thy help <eos> montague : montague montague for lancaster <eos> gloucester : thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason even with the dearest blood your bodies bear <eos> king edward iv : the harder match'd the greater victory : my mind presageth happy gain and conquest <eos> somerset : somerset somerset for lancaster <eos> gloucester : two of thy name both dukes of somerset have sold their lives unto the house of york and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold <eos> warwick : and lo where george of clarence sweeps along of force enough to bid his brother battle with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than the nature of a brother's love <eos> come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call <eos> clarence : father of warwick know you what this means <eos> look here i throw my infamy at thee i will not ruinate my father's house who gave his blood to lime the stones together and set up lancaster <eos> why trow'st thou warwick that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king <eos> perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath : to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthah's when he sacrificed his daughter <eos> i am so sorry for my trespass made that to deserve well at my brother's hands i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe with resolution wheresoe'er i meet thee <eos> as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad <eos> to plague thee for thy foul misleading me <eos> and so proud-hearted warwick i defy thee and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks <eos> pardon me edward i will make amends : and richard do not frown upon my faults for i will henceforth be no more unconstant <eos> king edward iv : now welcome more and ten times more beloved than if thou never hadst deserved our hate <eos> gloucester : welcome good clarence this is brotherlike <eos> warwick : o passing traitor perjured and unjust <eos> king edward iv : what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight <eos> or shall we beat the stones about thine ears <eos> warwick : alas i am not coop'd here for defence <eos> i will away towards barnet presently and bid thee battle edward if thou darest <eos> king edward iv : yes warwick edward dares and leads the way <eos> lords to the field saint george and victory <eos> 3 king henry vi king edward iv : so lie thou there : die thou and die our fear for warwick was a bug that fear'd us all <eos> now montague sit fast i seek for thee that warwick's bones may keep thine company <eos> warwick : ah who is nigh <eos> come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick <eos> why ask i that <eos> my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows <eos> that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe <eos> thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose top-branch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind <eos> these eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil have been as piercing as the mid-day sun to search the secret treasons of the world : the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres for who lived king but i could dig his grave <eos> and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow <eos> lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood <eos> my parks my walks my manors that i had <eos> even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body's length <eos> why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust <eos> and live we how we can yet die we must <eos> somerset : ah warwick warwick <eos> wert thou as we are <eos> we might recover all our loss again the queen from france hath brought a puissant power : even now we heard the news : ah could'st thou fly <eos> warwick : why then i would not fly <eos> ah montague if thou be there sweet brother take my hand <eos> and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile <eos> thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak <eos> come quickly montague or i am dead <eos> somerset : ah warwick <eos> montague hath breathed his last and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick and said 'commend me to my valiant brother <eos>' and more he would have said and more he spoke which sounded like a clamour in a vault that mought not be distinguished but at last i well might hear delivered with a groan 'o farewell warwick <eos>' warwick : sweet rest his soul <eos> fly lords and save yourselves for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven <eos> oxford : away away to meet the queen's great power <eos> 3 king henry vi king edward iv : thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory <eos> but in the midst of this bright-shining day i spy a black suspicious threatening cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed : i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us <eos> clarence : a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came : the very beams will dry those vapours up for every cloud engenders not a storm <eos> gloucester : the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her : if she have time to breathe be well assured her faction will be full as strong as ours <eos> king edward iv : we are advertised by our loving friends that they do hold their course toward tewksbury : we having now the best at barnet field will thither straight for willingness rids way and as we march our strength will be augmented in every county as we go along <eos> strike up the drum cry 'courage <eos>' and away <eos> 3 king henry vi queen margaret : great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss but cheerly seek how to redress their harms <eos> what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holding-anchor lost and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood <eos> yet lives our pilot still <eos> is't meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have saved <eos> ah what a shame <eos> ah what a fault were this <eos> say warwick was our anchor what of that <eos> and montague our topmost what of him <eos> our slaughter'd friends the tackles what of these <eos> why is not oxford here another anchor <eos> and somerset another goodly mast <eos> the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings <eos> and though unskilful why not ned and i for once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge <eos> we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck <eos> as good to chide the waves as speak them fair <eos> and what is edward but ruthless sea <eos> what clarence but a quicksand of deceit <eos> and richard but a ragged fatal rock <eos> all these the enemies to our poor bark <eos> say you can swim alas 'tis but a while <eos> tread on the sand why there you quickly sink : bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish that's a threefold death <eos> this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks <eos> why courage then <eos> what cannot be avoided 'twere childish weakness to lament or fear <eos> prince edward : methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should if a coward heard her speak these words infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him naked foil a man at arms <eos> i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes lest in our need he might infect another and make him of like spirit to himself <eos> if any such be here <eos>as god forbid <eos> <eos> let him depart before we need his help <eos> oxford : women and children of so high a courage and warriors faint <eos> why 'twere perpetual shame <eos> o brave young prince <eos> thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee : long mayst thou live to bear his image and renew his glories <eos> somerset : and he that will not fight for such a hope <eos> go home to bed and like the owl by day if he arise be mock'd and wonder'd at <eos> queen margaret : thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks <eos> prince edward : and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else <eos> messenger : prepare you lords for edward is at hand <eos> ready to fight therefore be resolute <eos> oxford : i thought no less : it is his policy to haste thus fast to find us unprovided <eos> somerset : but he's deceived we are in readiness <eos> queen margaret : this cheers my heart to see your forwardness <eos> oxford : here pitch our battle hence we will not budge <eos> king edward iv : brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood which by the heavens' assistance and your strength must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night <eos> i need not add more fuel to your fire for well i wot ye blaze to burn them out give signal to the fight and to it lords <eos> queen margaret : lords knights and gentlemen what i should say my tears gainsay for every word i speak ye see i drink the water of mine eyes <eos> therefore no more but this : henry your sovereign is prisoner to the foe his state usurp'd his realm a slaughter-house his subjects slain his statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil <eos> you fight in justice : then in god's name lords be valiant and give signal to the fight <eos> 3 king henry vi king edward iv : now here a period of tumultuous broils <eos> away with oxford to hames castle straight : for somerset off with his guilty head <eos> go bear them hence i will not hear them speak <eos> oxford : for my part i'll not trouble thee with words <eos> somerset : nor i but stoop with patience to my fortune <eos> queen margaret : so part we sadly in this troublous world to meet with joy in sweet jerusalem <eos> king edward iv : is proclamation made that who finds edward shall have a high reward and he his life <eos> gloucester : it is : and lo where youthful edward comes <eos> king edward iv : bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak <eos> what <eos> can so young a thorn begin to prick <eos> edward what satisfaction canst thou make for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects and all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to <eos> prince edward : speak like a subject proud ambitious york <eos> suppose that i am now my father's mouth resign thy chair and where i stand kneel thou whilst i propose the selfsame words to thee which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to <eos> queen margaret : ah that thy father had been so resolved <eos> gloucester : that you might still have worn the petticoat and ne'er have stol'n the breech from lancaster <eos> prince edward : let aesop fable in a winter's night his currish riddles sort not with this place <eos> gloucester : by heaven brat i'll plague ye for that word <eos> queen margaret : ay thou wast born to be a plague to men <eos> gloucester : for god's sake take away this captive scold <eos> prince edward : nay take away this scolding crookback rather <eos> king edward iv : peace wilful boy or i will charm your tongue <eos> clarence : untutor'd lad thou art too malapert <eos> prince edward : i know my duty you are all undutiful : lascivious edward and thou perjured george and thou mis-shapen dick i tell ye all i am your better traitors as ye are : and thou usurp'st my father's right and mine <eos> king edward iv : take that thou likeness of this railer here <eos> gloucester : sprawl'st thou <eos> take that to end thy agony <eos> clarence : and there's for twitting me with perjury <eos> queen margaret : o kill me too <eos> gloucester : marry and shall <eos> king edward iv : hold richard hold for we have done too much <eos> gloucester : why should she live to fill the world with words <eos> king edward iv : what doth she swoon <eos> use means for her recovery <eos> gloucester : clarence excuse me to the king my brother i'll hence to london on a serious matter : ere ye come there be sure to hear some news <eos> clarence : what <eos> what <eos> gloucester : the tower the tower <eos> queen margaret : o ned sweet ned <eos> speak to thy mother boy <eos> canst thou not speak <eos> o traitors <eos> murderers <eos> they that stabb'd caesar shed no blood at all did not offend nor were not worthy blame if this foul deed were by to equal it : he was a man this in respect a child : and men ne'er spend their fury on a child <eos> what's worse than murderer that i may name it <eos> no no my heart will burst and if i speak : and i will speak that so my heart may burst <eos> butchers and villains <eos> bloody cannibals <eos> how sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd <eos> you have no children butchers <eos> if you had the thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse : but if you ever chance to have a child look in his youth to have him so cut off as deathmen you have rid this sweet young prince <eos> king edward iv : away with her go bear her hence perforce <eos> queen margaret : nay never bear me hence dispatch me here here sheathe thy sword i'll pardon thee my death : what wilt thou not <eos> then clarence do it thou <eos> clarence : by heaven i will not do thee so much ease <eos> queen margaret : good clarence do sweet clarence do thou do it <eos> clarence : didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it <eos> queen margaret : ay but thou usest to forswear thyself : 'twas sin before but now 'tis charity <eos> what wilt thou not <eos> where is that devil's butcher hard-favour'd richard <eos> richard where art thou <eos> thou art not here : murder is thy alms-deed petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back <eos> king edward iv : away i say i charge ye bear her hence <eos> queen margaret : so come to you and yours as to this prince <eos> king edward iv : where's richard gone <eos> clarence : to london all in post and as i guess to make a bloody supper in the tower <eos> king edward iv : he's sudden if a thing comes in his head <eos> now march we hence : discharge the common sort with pay and thanks and let's away to london and see our gentle queen how well she fares : by this i hope she hath a son for me <eos> 3 king henry vi gloucester : good day my lord <eos> what at your book so hard <eos> king henry vi : ay my good lord : <eos>my lord i should say rather 'tis sin to flatter 'good' was little better : 'good gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike and both preposterous therefore not 'good lord <eos>' gloucester : sirrah leave us to ourselves : we must confer <eos> king henry vi : so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece and next his throat unto the butcher's knife <eos> what scene of death hath roscius now to act <eos> gloucester : suspicion always haunts the guilty mind the thief doth fear each bush an officer <eos> king henry vi : the bird that hath been limed in a bush with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush and i the hapless male to one sweet bird have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was limed was caught and kill'd <eos> gloucester : why what a peevish fool was that of crete that taught his son the office of a fowl <eos> an yet for all his wings the fool was drown'd <eos> king henry vi : i daedalus my poor boy icarus thy father minos that denied our course the sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life <eos> ah kill me with thy weapon not with words <eos> my breast can better brook thy dagger's point than can my ears that tragic history <eos> but wherefore dost thou come <eos> is't for my life <eos> gloucester : think'st thou i am an executioner <eos> king henry vi : a persecutor i am sure thou art : if murdering innocents be executing why then thou art an executioner <eos> gloucester : thy son i kill'd for his presumption <eos> king henry vi : hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine <eos> and thus i prophesy that many a thousand which now mistrust no parcel of my fear and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's and many an orphan's water-standing eye <eos> men for their sons wives for their husbands and orphans for their parents timeless death <eos> shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born <eos> the owl shriek'd at thy birth <eos>an evil sign the night-crow cried aboding luckless time dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top and chattering pies in dismal discords sung <eos> thy mother felt more than a mother's pain and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope to wit an indigested and deformed lump not like the fruit of such a goodly tree <eos> teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born to signify thou camest to bite the world : and if the rest be true which i have heard thou camest <eos> gloucester : i'll hear no more : die prophet in thy speech : for this amongst the rest was i ordain'd <eos> king henry vi : ay and for much more slaughter after this <eos> god forgive my sins and pardon thee <eos> gloucester : what will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground <eos> i thought it would have mounted <eos> see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death <eos> o may such purple tears be alway shed from those that wish the downfall of our house <eos> if any spark of life be yet remaining down down to hell and say i sent thee thither : i that have neither pity love nor fear <eos> indeed 'tis true that henry told me of for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward : had i not reason think ye to make haste and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right <eos> the midwife wonder'd and the women cried 'o jesus bless us he is born with teeth <eos>' and so i was which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog <eos> then since the heavens have shaped my body so let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it <eos> i have no brother i am like no brother and this word 'love' which graybeards call divine be resident in men like one another and not in me : i am myself alone <eos> clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light : but i will sort a pitchy day for thee for i will buz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life and then to purge his fear i'll be thy death <eos> king henry and the prince his son are gone : clarence thy turn is next and then the rest counting myself but bad till i be best <eos> i'll throw thy body in another room and triumph henry in thy day of doom <eos> 3 king henry vi king edward iv : once more we sit in england's royal throne re-purchased with the blood of enemies <eos> what valiant foemen like to autumn's corn have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride <eos> three dukes of somerset threefold renown'd for hardy and undoubted champions two cliffords as the father and the son and two northumberlands two braver men ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound with them the two brave bears warwick and montague that in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion and made the forest tremble when they roar'd <eos> thus have we swept suspicion from our seat and made our footstool of security <eos> come hither bess and let me kiss my boy <eos> young ned for thee thine uncles and myself have in our armours watch'd the winter's night went all afoot in summer's scalding heat that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain <eos> gloucester : king edward iv : clarence and gloucester love my lovely queen and kiss your princely nephew brothers both <eos> clarence : the duty that i owe unto your majesty i seal upon the lips of this sweet babe <eos> queen elizabeth : thanks noble clarence worthy brother thanks <eos> gloucester : and that i love the tree from whence thou sprang'st witness the loving kiss i give the fruit <eos> king edward iv : now am i seated as my soul delights having my country's peace and brothers' loves <eos> clarence : what will your grace have done with margaret <eos> reignier her father to the king of france hath pawn'd the sicils and jerusalem and hither have they sent it for her ransom <eos> king edward iv : away with her and waft her hence to france <eos> and now what rests but that we spend the time with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows such as befits the pleasure of the court <eos> sound drums and trumpets <eos> farewell sour annoy <eos> for here i hope begins our lasting joy <eos> archidamus : if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as i have said great difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia <eos> camillo : i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him <eos> archidamus : wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed <eos> camillo : beseech you <eos> archidamus : verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge : we cannot with such magnificence <eos>in so rare <eos>i know not what to say <eos> we will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot praise us as little accuse us <eos> camillo : you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely <eos> archidamus : believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance <eos> camillo : sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to bohemia <eos> they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now <eos> since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds <eos> the heavens continue their loves <eos> archidamus : i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it <eos> you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince mamillius : it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note <eos> camillo : i very well agree with you in the hopes of him : it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh : they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man <eos> archidamus : would they else be content to die <eos> camillo : yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live <eos> archidamus : if the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one <eos> polixenes : nine changes of the watery star hath been the shepherd's note since we have left our throne without a burthen : time as long again would be find up my brother with our thanks and yet we should for perpetuity go hence in debt : and therefore like a cipher yet standing in rich place i multiply with one 'we thank you' many thousands moe that go before it <eos> leontes : stay your thanks a while and pay them when you part <eos> polixenes : sir that's to-morrow <eos> i am question'd by my fears of what may chance or breed upon our absence that may blow no sneaping winds at home to make us say 'this is put forth too truly :' besides i have stay'd to tire your royalty <eos> leontes : we are tougher brother than you can put us to't <eos> polixenes : no longer stay <eos> leontes : one seven-night longer <eos> polixenes : very sooth to-morrow <eos> leontes : we'll part the time between's then and in that i'll no gainsaying <eos> polixenes : press me not beseech you so <eos> there is no tongue that moves none none i' the world so soon as yours could win me : so it should now were there necessity in your request although 'twere needful i denied it <eos> my affairs do even drag me homeward : which to hinder were in your love a whip to me my stay to you a charge and trouble : to save both farewell our brother <eos> leontes : tongue-tied our queen <eos> speak you <eos> hermione : i had thought sir to have held my peace until you have drawn oaths from him not to stay <eos> you sir charge him too coldly <eos> tell him you are sure all in bohemia's well this satisfaction the by-gone day proclaim'd : say this to him he's beat from his best ward <eos> leontes : well said hermione <eos> hermione : to tell he longs to see his son were strong : but let him say so then and let him go but let him swear so and he shall not stay we'll thwack him hence with distaffs <eos> yet of your royal presence i'll adventure the borrow of a week <eos> when at bohemia you take my lord i'll give him my commission to let him there a month behind the gest prefix'd for's parting : yet good deed leontes i love thee not a jar o' the clock behind what lady-she her lord <eos> you'll stay <eos> polixenes : no madam <eos> hermione : nay but you will <eos> polixenes : i may not verily <eos> hermione : verily <eos> you put me off with limber vows but i though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths should yet say 'sir no going <eos>' verily you shall not go : a lady's 'verily' 's as potent as a lord's <eos> will you go yet <eos> force me to keep you as a prisoner not like a guest so you shall pay your fees when you depart and save your thanks <eos> how say you <eos> my prisoner <eos> or my guest <eos> by your dread 'verily' one of them you shall be <eos> polixenes : your guest then madam : to be your prisoner should import offending which is for me less easy to commit than you to punish <eos> hermione : not your gaoler then but your kind hostess <eos> come i'll question you of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys : you were pretty lordings then <eos> polixenes : we were fair queen two lads that thought there was no more behind but such a day to-morrow as to-day and to be boy eternal <eos> hermione : was not my lord the verier wag o' the two <eos> polixenes : we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun and bleat the one at the other : what we changed was innocence for innocence we knew not the doctrine of ill-doing nor dream'd that any did <eos> had we pursued that life and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd with stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven boldly 'not guilty' the imposition clear'd hereditary ours <eos> hermione : by this we gather you have tripp'd since <eos> polixenes : o my most sacred lady <eos> temptations have since then been born to's for in those unfledged days was my wife a girl your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes of my young play-fellow <eos> hermione : grace to boot <eos> of this make no conclusion lest you say your queen and i are devils : yet go on the offences we have made you do we'll answer if you first sinn'd with us and that with us you did continue fault and that you slipp'd not with any but with us <eos> leontes : is he won yet <eos> hermione : he'll stay my lord <eos> leontes : at my request he would not <eos> hermione my dearest thou never spokest to better purpose <eos> hermione : never <eos> leontes : never but once <eos> hermione : what <eos> have i twice said well <eos> when was't before <eos> i prithee tell me cram's with praise and make's as fat as tame things : one good deed dying tongueless slaughters a thousand waiting upon that <eos> our praises are our wages : you may ride's with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere with spur we beat an acre <eos> but to the goal : my last good deed was to entreat his stay : what was my first <eos> it has an elder sister or i mistake you : o would her name were grace <eos> but once before i spoke to the purpose : when <eos> nay let me have't i long <eos> leontes : why that was when three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death ere i could make thee open thy white hand and clap thyself my love : then didst thou utter 'i am yours for ever <eos>' hermione : 'tis grace indeed <eos> why lo you now i have spoke to the purpose twice : the one for ever earn'd a royal husband the other for some while a friend <eos> leontes : mamillius : ay my good lord <eos> leontes : i' fecks <eos> why that's my bawcock <eos> what hast smutch'd thy nose <eos> they say it is a copy out of mine <eos> come captain we must be neat not neat but cleanly captain : and yet the steer the heifer and the calf are all call'd neat <eos> <eos>still virginalling upon his palm <eos> <eos>how now you wanton calf <eos> art thou my calf <eos> mamillius : yes if you will my lord <eos> leontes : thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have to be full like me : yet they say we are almost as like as eggs women say so that will say anything but were they false as o'er-dyed blacks as wind as waters false as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes no bourn 'twixt his and mine yet were it true to say this boy were like me <eos> come sir page look on me with your welkin eye : sweet villain <eos> most dear'st <eos> my collop <eos> can thy dam <eos> <eos>may't be <eos> <eos> affection <eos> thy intention stabs the centre : thou dost make possible things not so held communicatest with dreams <eos>how can this be <eos> <eos> with what's unreal thou coactive art and fellow'st nothing : then 'tis very credent thou mayst co-join with something and thou dost and that beyond commission and i find it and that to the infection of my brains and hardening of my brows <eos> polixenes : what means sicilia <eos> hermione : he something seems unsettled <eos> polixenes : how my lord <eos> what cheer <eos> how is't with you best brother <eos> hermione : you look as if you held a brow of much distraction are you moved my lord <eos> leontes : no in good earnest <eos> how sometimes nature will betray its folly its tenderness and make itself a pastime to harder bosoms <eos> looking on the lines of my boy's face methoughts i did recoil twenty-three years and saw myself unbreech'd in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled lest it should bite its master and so prove as ornaments oft do too dangerous : how like methought i then was to this kernel this squash this gentleman <eos> mine honest friend will you take eggs for money <eos> mamillius : no my lord i'll fight <eos> leontes : you will <eos> why happy man be's dole <eos> my brother are you so fond of your young prince as we do seem to be of ours <eos> polixenes : if at home sir he's all my exercise my mirth my matter now my sworn friend and then mine enemy my parasite my soldier statesman all : he makes a july's day short as december and with his varying childness cures in me thoughts that would thick my blood <eos> leontes : so stands this squire officed with me : we two will walk my lord and leave you to your graver steps <eos> hermione how thou lovest us show in our brother's welcome let what is dear in sicily be cheap : next to thyself and my young rover he's apparent to my heart <eos> hermione : if you would seek us we are yours i' the garden : shall's attend you there <eos> leontes : to your own bents dispose you : you'll be found be you beneath the sky <eos> i am angling now though you perceive me not how i give line <eos> go to go to <eos> how she holds up the neb the bill to him <eos> and arms her with the boldness of a wife to her allowing husband <eos> gone already <eos> inch-thick knee-deep o'er head and ears a fork'd one <eos> go play boy play : thy mother plays and i play too but so disgraced a part whose issue will hiss me to my grave : contempt and clamour will be my knell <eos> go play boy play <eos> there have been or i am much deceived cuckolds ere now and many a man there is even at this present now while i speak this holds his wife by the arm that little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by sir smile his neighbour : nay there's comfort in't whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd as mine against their will <eos> should all despair that have revolted wives the tenth of mankind would hang themselves <eos> physic for't there is none it is a bawdy planet that will strike where 'tis predominant and 'tis powerful think it from east west north and south : be it concluded no barricado for a belly know't it will let in and out the enemy with bag and baggage : many thousand on's have the disease and feel't not <eos> how now boy <eos> mamillius : i am like you they say <eos> leontes : why that's some comfort <eos> what camillo there <eos> camillo : ay my good lord <eos> leontes : go play mamillius thou'rt an honest man <eos> camillo this great sir will yet stay longer <eos> camillo : you had much ado to make his anchor hold : when you cast out it still came home <eos> leontes : didst note it <eos> camillo : he would not stay at your petitions : made his business more material <eos> leontes : didst perceive it <eos> they're here with me already whispering rounding 'sicilia is a so-forth :' 'tis far gone when i shall gust it last <eos> how came't camillo that he did stay <eos> camillo : at the good queen's entreaty <eos> leontes : at the queen's be't : 'good' should be pertinent but so it is it is not <eos> was this taken by any understanding pate but thine <eos> for thy conceit is soaking will draw in more than the common blocks : not noted is't but of the finer natures <eos> by some severals of head-piece extraordinary <eos> lower messes perchance are to this business purblind <eos> say <eos> camillo : business my lord <eos> i think most understand bohemia stays here longer <eos> leontes : ha <eos> camillo : stays here longer <eos> leontes : ay but why <eos> camillo : to satisfy your highness and the entreaties of our most gracious mistress <eos> leontes : satisfy <eos> the entreaties of your mistress <eos> satisfy <eos> let that suffice <eos> i have trusted thee camillo with all the nearest things to my heart as well my chamber-councils wherein priest-like thou hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed thy penitent reform'd : but we have been deceived in thy integrity deceived in that which seems so <eos> camillo : be it forbid my lord <eos> leontes : to bide upon't thou art not honest or if thou inclinest that way thou art a coward which hoxes honesty behind restraining from course required or else thou must be counted a servant grafted in my serious trust and therein negligent or else a fool that seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn and takest it all for jest <eos> camillo : my gracious lord i may be negligent foolish and fearful in every one of these no man is free but that his negligence his folly fear among the infinite doings of the world sometime puts forth <eos> in your affairs my lord if ever i were wilful-negligent it was my folly if industriously i play'd the fool it was my negligence not weighing well the end if ever fearful to do a thing where i the issue doubted where of the execution did cry out against the non-performance 'twas a fear which oft infects the wisest : these my lord are such allow'd infirmities that honesty is never free of <eos> but beseech your grace be plainer with me let me know my trespass by its own visage : if i then deny it 'tis none of mine <eos> leontes : ha' not you seen camillo <eos> but that's past doubt you have or your eye-glass is thicker than a cuckold's horn <eos>or heard <eos> for to a vision so apparent rumour cannot be mute <eos>or thought <eos>for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think <eos> my wife is slippery <eos> if thou wilt confess or else be impudently negative to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say my wife's a hobby-horse deserves a name as rank as any flax-wench that puts to before her troth-plight : say't and justify't <eos> camillo : i would not be a stander-by to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so without my present vengeance taken : 'shrew my heart you never spoke what did become you less than this which to reiterate were sin as deep as that though true <eos> leontes : is whispering nothing <eos> is leaning cheek to cheek <eos> is meeting noses <eos> kissing with inside lip <eos> stopping the career of laughing with a sigh <eos> <eos>a note infallible of breaking honesty <eos>horsing foot on foot <eos> skulking in corners <eos> wishing clocks more swift <eos> hours minutes <eos> noon midnight <eos> and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only that would unseen be wicked <eos> is this nothing <eos> why then the world and all that's in't is nothing the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings if this be nothing <eos> camillo : good my lord be cured of this diseased opinion and betimes for 'tis most dangerous <eos> leontes : say it be 'tis true <eos> camillo : no no my lord <eos> leontes : it is you lie you lie : i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave or else a hovering temporizer that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil inclining to them both : were my wife's liver infected as her life she would not live the running of one glass <eos> camillo : who does infect her <eos> leontes : why he that wears her like a medal hanging about his neck bohemia : who if i had servants true about me that bare eyes to see alike mine honour as their profits their own particular thrifts they would do that which should undo more doing : ay and thou his cupbearer <eos>whom i from meaner form have benched and reared to worship who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven how i am galled <eos>mightst bespice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink which draught to me were cordial <eos> camillo : sir my lord i could do this and that with no rash potion but with a lingering dram that should not work maliciously like poison : but i cannot believe this crack to be in my dread mistress so sovereignly being honourable <eos> i have loved thee <eos> leontes : make that thy question and go rot <eos> dost think i am so muddy so unsettled to appoint myself in this vexation sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets which to preserve is sleep which being spotted is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son who i do think is mine and love as mine without ripe moving to't <eos> would i do this <eos> could man so blench <eos> camillo : i must believe you sir : i do and will fetch off bohemia for't provided that when he's removed your highness will take again your queen as yours at first even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms known and allied to yours <eos> leontes : thou dost advise me even so as i mine own course have set down : i'll give no blemish to her honour none <eos> camillo : my lord go then and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia and with your queen <eos> i am his cupbearer : if from me he have wholesome beverage account me not your servant <eos> leontes : this is all : do't and thou hast the one half of my heart do't not thou split'st thine own <eos> camillo : i'll do't my lord <eos> leontes : i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me <eos> camillo : o miserable lady <eos> but for me what case stand i in <eos> i must be the poisoner of good polixenes and my ground to do't is the obedience to a master one who in rebellion with himself will have all that are his so too <eos> to do this deed promotion follows <eos> if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourish'd after i'ld not do't but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one let villany itself forswear't <eos> i must forsake the court : to do't or no is certain to me a break-neck <eos> happy star reign now <eos> here comes bohemia <eos> polixenes : this is strange : methinks my favour here begins to warp <eos> not speak <eos> good day camillo <eos> camillo : hail most royal sir <eos> polixenes : what is the news i' the court <eos> camillo : none rare my lord <eos> polixenes : the king hath on him such a countenance as he had lost some province and a region loved as he loves himself : even now i met him with customary compliment when he wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling a lip of much contempt speeds from me and so leaves me to consider what is breeding that changeth thus his manners <eos> camillo : i dare not know my lord <eos> polixenes : how <eos> dare not <eos> do not <eos> do you know and dare not <eos> be intelligent to me : 'tis thereabouts for to yourself what you do know you must <eos> and cannot say you dare not <eos> good camillo your changed complexions are to me a mirror which shows me mine changed too for i must be a party in this alteration finding myself thus alter'd with 't <eos> camillo : there is a sickness which puts some of us in distemper but i cannot name the disease and it is caught of you that yet are well <eos> polixenes : how <eos> caught of me <eos> make me not sighted like the basilisk : i have look'd on thousands who have sped the better by my regard but kill'd none so <eos> camillo <eos> as you are certainly a gentleman thereto clerk-like experienced which no less adorns our gentry than our parents' noble names in whose success we are gentle <eos>i beseech you if you know aught which does behove my knowledge thereof to be inform'd imprison't not in ignorant concealment <eos> camillo : i may not answer <eos> polixenes : a sickness caught of me and yet i well <eos> i must be answer'd <eos> dost thou hear camillo i conjure thee by all the parts of man which honour does acknowledge whereof the least is not this suit of mine that thou declare what incidency thou dost guess of harm is creeping toward me how far off how near which way to be prevented if to be if not how best to bear it <eos> camillo : sir i will tell you since i am charged in honour and by him that i think honourable : therefore mark my counsel which must be even as swiftly follow'd as i mean to utter it or both yourself and me cry lost and so good night <eos> polixenes : on good camillo <eos> camillo : i am appointed him to murder you <eos> polixenes : by whom camillo <eos> camillo : by the king <eos> polixenes : for what <eos> camillo : he thinks nay with all confidence he swears as he had seen't or been an instrument to vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen forbiddenly <eos> polixenes : o then my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yoked with his that did betray the best <eos> turn then my freshest reputation to a savour that may strike the dullest nostril where i arrive and my approach be shunn'd nay hated too worse than the great'st infection that e'er was heard or read <eos> camillo : swear his thought over by each particular star in heaven and by all their influences you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of his folly whose foundation is piled upon his faith and will continue the standing of his body <eos> polixenes : how should this grow <eos> camillo : i know not : but i am sure 'tis safer to avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born <eos> if therefore you dare trust my honesty that lies enclosed in this trunk which you shall bear along impawn'd away to-night <eos> your followers i will whisper to the business and will by twos and threes at several posterns clear them o' the city <eos> for myself i'll put my fortunes to your service which are here by this discovery lost <eos> be not uncertain for by the honour of my parents i have utter'd truth : which if you seek to prove i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth thereon his execution sworn <eos> polixenes : i do believe thee : i saw his heart in 's face <eos> give me thy hand : be pilot to me and thy places shall still neighbour mine <eos> my ships are ready and my people did expect my hence departure two days ago <eos> this jealousy is for a precious creature : as she's rare must it be great and as his person's mighty must it be violent and as he does conceive he is dishonour'd by a man which ever profess'd to him why his revenges must in that be made more bitter <eos> fear o'ershades me : good expedition be my friend and comfort the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing of his ill-ta'en suspicion <eos> come camillo i will respect thee as a father if thou bear'st my life off hence : let us avoid <eos> camillo : it is in mine authority to command the keys of all the posterns : please your highness to take the urgent hour <eos> come sir away <eos> hermione : take the boy to you : he so troubles me 'tis past enduring <eos> first lady : come my gracious lord shall i be your playfellow <eos> mamillius : no i'll none of you <eos> first lady : why my sweet lord <eos> mamillius : you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if i were a baby still <eos> i love you better <eos> second lady : and why so my lord <eos> mamillius : not for because your brows are blacker yet black brows they say become some women best so that there be not too much hair there but in a semicircle or a half-moon made with a pen <eos> second lady : who taught you this <eos> mamillius : i learnt it out of women's faces <eos> pray now what colour are your eyebrows <eos> first lady : blue my lord <eos> mamillius : nay that's a mock : i have seen a lady's nose that has been blue but not her eyebrows <eos> first lady : hark ye the queen your mother rounds apace : we shall present our services to a fine new prince one of these days and then you'ld wanton with us if we would have you <eos> second lady : she is spread of late into a goodly bulk : good time encounter her <eos> hermione : what wisdom stirs amongst you <eos> come sir now i am for you again : pray you sit by us and tell 's a tale <eos> mamillius : merry or sad shall't be <eos> hermione : as merry as you will <eos> mamillius : a sad tale's best for winter : i have one of sprites and goblins <eos> hermione : let's have that good sir <eos> come on sit down : come on and do your best to fright me with your sprites you're powerful at it <eos> mamillius : there was a man <eos> hermione : nay come sit down then on <eos> mamillius : dwelt by a churchyard : i will tell it softly yond crickets shall not hear it <eos> hermione : come on then and give't me in mine ear <eos> leontes : was he met there <eos> his train <eos> camillo with him <eos> first lord : behind the tuft of pines i met them never saw i men scour so on their way : i eyed them even to their ships <eos> leontes : how blest am i in my just censure in my true opinion <eos> alack for lesser knowledge <eos> how accursed in being so blest <eos> there may be in the cup a spider steep'd and one may drink depart and yet partake no venom for his knowledge is not infected : but if one present the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides with violent hefts <eos> i have drunk and seen the spider <eos> camillo was his help in this his pander : there is a plot against my life my crown all's true that is mistrusted : that false villain whom i employ'd was pre-employ'd by him : he has discover'd my design and i remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick for them to play at will <eos> how came the posterns so easily open <eos> first lord : by his great authority which often hath no less prevail'd than so on your command <eos> leontes : i know't too well <eos> give me the boy : i am glad you did not nurse him : though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him <eos> hermione : what is this <eos> sport <eos> leontes : bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him <eos> and let her sport herself with that she's big with for 'tis polixenes has made thee swell thus <eos> hermione : but i'ld say he had not and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying howe'er you lean to the nayward <eos> leontes : you my lords look on her mark her well be but about to say 'she is a goodly lady' and the justice of your bearts will thereto add 'tis pity she's not honest honourable :' praise her but for this her without-door form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth use <eos>o i am out <eos> that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself : these shrugs these hums and ha's when you have said 'she's goodly' come between ere you can say 'she's honest :' but be 't known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be she's an adulteress <eos> hermione : should a villain say so the most replenish'd villain in the world he were as much more villain : you my lord do but mistake <eos> leontes : you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes : o thou thing <eos> which i'll not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar : i have said she's an adulteress i have said with whom : more she's a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that she's a bed-swerver even as bad as those that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy to this their late escape <eos> hermione : no by my life <eos> privy to none of this <eos> how will this grieve you when you shall come to clearer knowledge that you thus have publish'd me <eos> gentle my lord you scarce can right me throughly then to say you did mistake <eos> leontes : no if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the centre is not big enough to bear a school-boy's top <eos> away with her <eos> to prison <eos> he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks <eos> hermione : there's some ill planet reigns : i must be patient till the heavens look with an aspect more favourable <eos> good my lords i am not prone to weeping as our sex commonly are the want of which vain dew perchance shall dry your pities : but i have that honourable grief lodged here which burns worse than tears drown : beseech you all my lords with thoughts so qualified as your charities shall best instruct you measure me and so the king's will be perform'd <eos> leontes : shall i be heard <eos> hermione : who is't that goes with me <eos> beseech your highness my women may be with me for you see my plight requires it <eos> do not weep good fools there is no cause : when you shall know your mistress has deserved prison then abound in tears as i come out : this action i now go on is for my better grace <eos> adieu my lord : i never wish'd to see you sorry now i trust i shall <eos> my women come you have leave <eos> leontes : go do our bidding hence <eos> first lord : beseech your highness call the queen again <eos> antigonus : be certain what you do sir lest your justice prove violence in the which three great ones suffer yourself your queen your son <eos> first lord : for her my lord i dare my life lay down and will do't sir please you to accept it that the queen is spotless i' the eyes of heaven and to you i mean in this which you accuse her <eos> antigonus : if it prove she's otherwise i'll keep my stables where i lodge my wife i'll go in couples with her than when i feel and see her no farther trust her for every inch of woman in the world ay every dram of woman's flesh is false if she be <eos> leontes : hold your peaces <eos> first lord : good my lord <eos> antigonus : it is for you we speak not for ourselves : you are abused and by some putter-on that will be damn'd for't would i knew the villain i would land-damn him <eos> be she honour-flaw'd i have three daughters the eldest is eleven the second and the third nine and some five if this prove true they'll pay for't : by mine honour i'll geld 'em all fourteen they shall not see to bring false generations : they are co-heirs and i had rather glib myself than they should not produce fair issue <eos> leontes : cease no more <eos> you smell this business with a sense as cold as is a dead man's nose : but i do see't and feel't as you feel doing thus and see withal the instruments that feel <eos> antigonus : if it be so we need no grave to bury honesty : there's not a grain of it the face to sweeten of the whole dungy earth <eos> leontes : what <eos> lack i credit <eos> first lord : i had rather you did lack than i my lord upon this ground and more it would content me to have her honour true than your suspicion be blamed for't how you might <eos> leontes : why what need we commune with you of this but rather follow our forceful instigation <eos> our prerogative calls not your counsels but our natural goodness imparts this which if you or stupefied or seeming so in skill cannot or will not relish a truth like us inform yourselves we need no more of your advice : the matter the loss the gain the ordering on't is all properly ours <eos> antigonus : and i wish my liege you had only in your silent judgment tried it without more overture <eos> leontes : how could that be <eos> either thou art most ignorant by age or thou wert born a fool <eos> camillo's flight added to their familiarity which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture that lack'd sight only nought for approbation but only seeing all other circumstances made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding : yet for a greater confirmation for in an act of this importance 'twere most piteous to be wild i have dispatch'd in post to sacred delphos to apollo's temple cleomenes and dion whom you know of stuff'd sufficiency : now from the oracle they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me <eos> have i done well <eos> first lord : well done my lord <eos> leontes : though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to the minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to the truth <eos> so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confined lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform <eos> come follow us we are to speak in public for this business will raise us all <eos> antigonus : paulina : the keeper of the prison call to him let him have knowledge who i am <eos> good lady no court in europe is too good for thee what dost thou then in prison <eos> now good sir you know me do you not <eos> gaoler : for a worthy lady and one whom much i honour <eos> paulina : pray you then conduct me to the queen <eos> gaoler : i may not madam : to the contrary i have express commandment <eos> paulina : here's ado to lock up honesty and honour from the access of gentle visitors <eos> is't lawful pray you to see her women <eos> any of them <eos> emilia <eos> gaoler : so please you madam to put apart these your attendants i shall bring emilia forth <eos> paulina : i pray now call her <eos> withdraw yourselves <eos> gaoler : and madam i must be present at your conference <eos> paulina : well be't so prithee <eos> here's such ado to make no stain a stain as passes colouring <eos> dear gentlewoman how fares our gracious lady <eos> emilia : as well as one so great and so forlorn may hold together : on her frights and griefs which never tender lady hath born greater she is something before her time deliver'd <eos> paulina : a boy <eos> emilia : a daughter and a goodly babe lusty and like to live : the queen receives much comfort in't says 'my poor prisoner i am innocent as you <eos>' paulina : i dare be sworn these dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king beshrew them <eos> he must be told on't and he shall : the office becomes a woman best i'll take't upon me : if i prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister and never to my red-look'd anger be the trumpet any more <eos> pray you emilia commend my best obedience to the queen : if she dares trust me with her little babe i'll show't the king and undertake to be her advocate to the loud'st <eos> we do not know how he may soften at the sight o' the child : the silence often of pure innocence persuades when speaking fails <eos> emilia : most worthy madam your honour and your goodness is so evident that your free undertaking cannot miss a thriving issue : there is no lady living so meet for this great errand <eos> please your ladyship to visit the next room i'll presently acquaint the queen of your most noble offer who but to-day hammer'd of this design but durst not tempt a minister of honour lest she should be denied <eos> paulina : tell her emilia <eos> i'll use that tongue i have : if wit flow from't as boldness from my bosom let 't not be doubted i shall do good <eos> emilia : now be you blest for it <eos> i'll to the queen : please you come something nearer <eos> gaoler : madam if't please the queen to send the babe i know not what i shall incur to pass it having no warrant <eos> paulina : you need not fear it sir : this child was prisoner to the womb and is by law and process of great nature thence freed and enfranchised not a party to the anger of the king nor guilty of if any be the trespass of the queen <eos> gaoler : i do believe it <eos> paulina : do not you fear : upon mine honour i will stand betwixt you and danger <eos> leontes : nor night nor day no rest : it is but weakness to bear the matter thus mere weakness <eos> if the cause were not in being <eos>part o' the cause she the adulteress for the harlot king is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank and level of my brain plot-proof but she i can hook to me : say that she were gone given to the fire a moiety of my rest might come to me again <eos> who's there <eos> first servant : my lord <eos> leontes : how does the boy <eos> first servant : he took good rest to-night 'tis hoped his sickness is discharged <eos> leontes : to see his nobleness <eos> conceiving the dishonour of his mother he straight declined droop'd took it deeply fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep and downright languish'd <eos> leave me solely : go see how he fares <eos> fie fie <eos> no thought of him : the thought of my revenges that way recoil upon me : in himself too mighty and in his parties his alliance let him be until a time may serve : for present vengeance take it on her <eos> camillo and polixenes laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow : they should not laugh if i could reach them nor shall she within my power <eos> first lord : you must not enter <eos> paulina : nay rather good my lords be second to me : fear you his tyrannous passion more alas than the queen's life <eos> a gracious innocent soul more free than he is jealous <eos> antigonus : that's enough <eos> second servant : madam he hath not slept tonight commanded none should come at him <eos> paulina : not so hot good sir : i come to bring him sleep <eos> 'tis such as you that creep like shadows by him and do sigh at each his needless heavings such as you nourish the cause of his awaking : i do come with words as medicinal as true honest as either to purge him of that humour that presses him from sleep <eos> leontes : what noise there ho <eos> paulina : no noise my lord but needful conference about some gossips for your highness <eos> leontes : how <eos> away with that audacious lady <eos> antigonus i charged thee that she should not come about me : i knew she would <eos> antigonus : i told her so my lord on your displeasure's peril and on mine she should not visit you <eos> leontes : what canst not rule her <eos> paulina : from all dishonesty he can : in this unless he take the course that you have done commit me for committing honour trust it he shall not rule me <eos> antigonus : la you now you hear : when she will take the rein i let her run but she'll not stumble <eos> paulina : good my liege i come and i beseech you hear me who profess myself your loyal servant your physician your most obedient counsellor yet that dare less appear so in comforting your evils than such as most seem yours : i say i come from your good queen <eos> leontes : good queen <eos> paulina : good queen my lord good queen i say good queen and would by combat make her good so were i a man the worst about you <eos> leontes : force her hence <eos> paulina : let him that makes but trifles of his eyes first hand me : on mine own accord i'll off but first i'll do my errand <eos> the good queen for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter here 'tis commends it to your blessing <eos> leontes : out <eos> a mankind witch <eos> hence with her out o' door : a most intelligencing bawd <eos> paulina : not so : i am as ignorant in that as you in so entitling me and no less honest than you are mad which is enough i'll warrant as this world goes to pass for honest <eos> leontes : traitors <eos> will you not push her out <eos> give her the bastard <eos> thou dotard <eos> thou art woman-tired unroosted by thy dame partlet here <eos> take up the bastard take't up i say give't to thy crone <eos> paulina : for ever unvenerable be thy hands if thou takest up the princess by that forced baseness which he has put upon't <eos> leontes : he dreads his wife <eos> paulina : so i would you did then 'twere past all doubt you'ld call your children yours <eos> leontes : a nest of traitors <eos> antigonus : i am none by this good light <eos> paulina : nor i nor any but one that's here and that's himself for he the sacred honour of himself his queen's his hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander whose sting is sharper than the sword's and will not <eos> for as the case now stands it is a curse he cannot be compell'd to't <eos>once remove the root of his opinion which is rotten as ever oak or stone was sound <eos> leontes : a callat of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband and now baits me <eos> this brat is none of mine it is the issue of polixenes : hence with it and together with the dam commit them to the fire <eos> paulina : it is yours and might we lay the old proverb to your charge so like you 'tis the worse <eos> behold my lords although the print be little the whole matter and copy of the father eye nose lip the trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles the very mould and frame of hand nail finger : and thou good goddess nature which hast made it so like to him that got it if thou hast the ordering of the mind too 'mongst all colours no yellow in't lest she suspect as he does her children not her husband's <eos> leontes : a gross hag and lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd that wilt not stay her tongue <eos> antigonus : hang all the husbands that cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself hardly one subject <eos> leontes : once more take her hence <eos> paulina : a most unworthy and unnatural lord can do no more <eos> leontes : i'll ha' thee burnt <eos> paulina : i care not : it is an heretic that makes the fire not she which burns in't <eos> i'll not call you tyrant but this most cruel usage of your queen not able to produce more accusation than your own weak-hinged fancy something savours of tyranny and will ignoble make you yea scandalous to the world <eos> leontes : on your allegiance out of the chamber with her <eos> were i a tyrant where were her life <eos> she durst not call me so if she did know me one <eos> away with her <eos> paulina : i pray you do not push me i'll be gone <eos> look to your babe my lord 'tis yours : jove send her a better guiding spirit <eos> what needs these hands <eos> you that are thus so tender o'er his follies will never do him good not one of you <eos> so so : farewell we are gone <eos> leontes : thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this <eos> my child <eos> away with't <eos> even thou that hast a heart so tender o'er it take it hence and see it instantly consumed with fire even thou and none but thou <eos> take it up straight : within this hour bring me word 'tis done and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life with what thou else call'st thine <eos> if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath say so the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out <eos> go take it to the fire for thou set'st on thy wife <eos> antigonus : i did not sir : these lords my noble fellows if they please can clear me in't <eos> lords : we can : my royal liege he is not guilty of her coming hither <eos> leontes : you're liars all <eos> first lord : beseech your highness give us better credit : we have always truly served you and beseech you so to esteem of us and on our knees we beg as recompense of our dear services past and to come that you do change this purpose which being so horrible so bloody must lead on to some foul issue : we all kneel <eos> leontes : i am a feather for each wind that blows : shall i live on to see this bastard kneel and call me father <eos> better burn it now than curse it then <eos> but be it let it live <eos> it shall not neither <eos> you sir come you hither you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery your midwife there to save this bastard's life <eos>for 'tis a bastard so sure as this beard's grey <eos>what will you adventure to save this brat's life <eos> antigonus : any thing my lord that my ability may undergo and nobleness impose : at least thus much : i'll pawn the little blood which i have left to save the innocent : any thing possible <eos> leontes : it shall be possible <eos> swear by this sword thou wilt perform my bidding <eos> antigonus : i will my lord <eos> leontes : mark and perform it see'st thou <eos> for the fail of any point in't shall not only be death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife whom for this time we pardon <eos> we enjoin thee as thou art liege-man to us that thou carry this female bastard hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions and that there thou leave it without more mercy to its own protection and favour of the climate <eos> as by strange fortune it came to us i do in justice charge thee on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it <eos> take it up <eos> antigonus : i swear to do this though a present death had been more merciful <eos> come on poor babe : some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens to be thy nurses <eos> wolves and bears they say casting their savageness aside have done like offices of pity <eos> sir be prosperous in more than this deed does require <eos> and blessing against this cruelty fight on thy side poor thing condemn'd to loss <eos> leontes : no i'll not rear another's issue <eos> servant : please your highness posts from those you sent to the oracle are come an hour since : cleomenes and dion being well arrived from delphos are both landed hasting to the court <eos> first lord : so please you sir their speed hath been beyond account <eos> leontes : twenty-three days they have been absent : 'tis good speed foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear <eos> prepare you lords summon a session that we may arraign our most disloyal lady for as she hath been publicly accused so shall she have a just and open trial <eos> while she lives my heart will be a burthen to me <eos> leave me and think upon my bidding <eos> cleomenes : the climate's delicate the air most sweet fertile the isle the temple much surpassing the common praise it bears <eos> dion : i shall report for most it caught me the celestial habits methinks i so should term them and the reverence of the grave wearers <eos> o the sacrifice <eos> how ceremonious solemn and unearthly it was i' the offering <eos> cleomenes : but of all the burst and the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle kin to jove's thunder so surprised my sense <eos> that i was nothing <eos> dion : if the event o' the journey prove as successful to the queen <eos>o be't so <eos> <eos> as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy the time is worth the use on't <eos> cleomenes : great apollo turn all to the best <eos> these proclamations so forcing faults upon hermione i little like <eos> dion : the violent carriage of it will clear or end the business : when the oracle thus by apollo's great divine seal'd up shall the contents discover something rare even then will rush to knowledge <eos> go : fresh horses <eos> and gracious be the issue <eos> leontes : this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes 'gainst our heart : the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved <eos> let us be clear'd of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation <eos> produce the prisoner <eos> officer : it is his highness' pleasure that the queen appear in person here in court <eos> silence <eos> leontes : read the indictment <eos> officer : hermione : since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me to say 'not guilty :' mine integrity being counted falsehood shall as i express it be so received <eos> but thus : if powers divine behold our human actions as they do i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience <eos> you my lord best know who least will seem to do so my past life hath been as continent as chaste as true as i am now unhappy which is more than history can pattern though devised and play'd to take spectators <eos> for behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honour 'fore who please to come and hear <eos> for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare : for honour 'tis a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for <eos> i appeal to your own conscience sir before polixenes came to your court how i was in your grace how merited to be so since he came with what encounter so uncurrent i have strain'd to appear thus : if one jot beyond the bound of honour or in act or will that way inclining harden'd be the hearts of all that hear me and my near'st of kin cry fie upon my grave <eos> leontes : i ne'er heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first <eos> hermione : that's true enough through 'tis a saying sir not due to me <eos> leontes : you will not own it <eos> hermione : more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault i must not at all acknowledge <eos> for polixenes with whom i am accused i do confess i loved him as in honour he required with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded : which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke even since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours <eos> now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dish'd for me to try how : all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant <eos> leontes : you knew of his departure as you know what you have underta'en to do in's absence <eos> hermione : sir you speak a language that i understand not : my life stands in the level of your dreams which i'll lay down <eos> leontes : your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dream'd it <eos> as you were past all shame <eos> those of your fact are so <eos>so past all truth : which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning it <eos>which is indeed more criminal in thee than it <eos>so thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death <eos> hermione : sir spare your threats : the bug which you would fright me with i seek <eos> to me can life be no commodity : the crown and comfort of my life your favour i do give lost for i do feel it gone but know not how it went <eos> my second joy and first-fruits of my body from his presence i am barr'd like one infectious <eos> my third comfort starr'd most unluckily is from my breast the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth haled out to murder : myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet : with immodest hatred the child-bed privilege denied which 'longs to women of all fashion lastly hurried here to this place i' the open air before i have got strength of limit <eos> now my liege tell me what blessings i have here alive that i should fear to die <eos> therefore proceed <eos> but yet hear this : mistake me not no life i prize it not a straw but for mine honour which i would free if i shall be condemn'd upon surmises all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake i tell you 'tis rigor and not law <eos> your honours all i do refer me to the oracle : apollo be my judge <eos> first lord : this your request is altogether just : therefore bring forth and in apollos name his oracle <eos> hermione : the emperor of russia was my father : o that he were alive and here beholding his daughter's trial <eos> that he did but see the flatness of my misery yet with eyes of pity not revenge <eos> officer : you here shall swear upon this sword of justice that you cleomenes and dion have been both at delphos and from thence have brought the seal'd-up oracle by the hand deliver'd of great apollo's priest and that since then you have not dared to break the holy seal nor read the secrets in't <eos> cleomenes : all this we swear <eos> leontes : break up the seals and read <eos> officer : lords : now blessed be the great apollo <eos> hermione : praised <eos> leontes : hast thou read truth <eos> officer : ay my lord even so as it is here set down <eos> leontes : there is no truth at all i' the oracle : the sessions shall proceed : this is mere falsehood <eos> servant : my lord the king the king <eos> leontes : what is the business <eos> servant : o sir i shall be hated to report it <eos> the prince your son with mere conceit and fear of the queen's speed is gone <eos> leontes : how <eos> gone <eos> servant : is dead <eos> leontes : apollo's angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice <eos> how now there <eos> paulina : this news is mortal to the queen : look down and see what death is doing <eos> leontes : take her hence : her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover : i have too much believed mine own suspicion : beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life <eos> apollo pardon my great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle <eos> i'll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes : which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing 't and being done : he most humane and fill'd with honour to my kingly guest unclasp'd my practise quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the hazard of all encertainties himself commended no richer than his honour : how he glisters thorough my rust <eos> and how his pity does my deeds make the blacker <eos> paulina : woe the while <eos> o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it break too <eos> first lord : what fit is this good lady <eos> paulina : what studied torments tyrant hast for me <eos> what wheels <eos> racks <eos> fires <eos> what flaying <eos> boiling <eos> in leads or oils <eos> what old or newer torture must i receive whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst <eos> thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies fancies too weak for boys too green and idle for girls of nine o think what they have done and then run mad indeed stark mad <eos> for all thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it <eos> that thou betray'dst polixenes'twas nothing that did but show thee of a fool inconstant and damnable ingrateful : nor was't much thou wouldst have poison'd good camillo's honour to have him kill a king : poor trespasses more monstrous standing by : whereof i reckon the casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter to be or none or little though a devil would have shed water out of fire ere done't : nor is't directly laid to thee the death of the young prince whose honourable thoughts thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart that could conceive a gross and foolish sire blemish'd his gracious dam : this is not no laid to thy answer : but the last <eos>o lords when i have said cry 'woe <eos>' the queen the queen the sweet'st dear'st creature's dead and vengeance for't not dropp'd down yet <eos> first lord : the higher powers forbid <eos> paulina : i say she's dead i'll swear't <eos> if word nor oath prevail not go and see : if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip her eye heat outwardly or breath within i'll serve you as i would do the gods <eos> but o thou tyrant <eos> do not repent these things for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee to nothing but despair <eos> a thousand knees ten thousand years together naked fasting upon a barren mountain and still winter in storm perpetual could not move the gods to look that way thou wert <eos> leontes : go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest <eos> first lord : say no more : howe'er the business goes you have made fault i' the boldness of your speech <eos> paulina : i am sorry for't : all faults i make when i shall come to know them i do repent <eos> alas <eos> i have show'd too much the rashness of a woman : he is touch'd to the noble heart <eos> what's gone and what's past help should be past grief : do not receive affliction at my petition i beseech you rather let me be punish'd that have minded you of what you should forget <eos> now good my liege sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman : the love i bore your queen <eos>lo fool again <eos> <eos> i'll speak of her no more nor of your children i'll not remember you of my own lord who is lost too : take your patience to you and i'll say nothing <eos> leontes : thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee <eos> prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son : one grave shall be for both : upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual <eos> once a day i'll visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation : so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it <eos> come and lead me unto these sorrows <eos> antigonus : thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon the deserts of bohemia <eos> mariner : ay my lord : and fear we have landed in ill time : the skies look grimly and threaten present blusters <eos> in my conscience the heavens with that we have in hand are angry and frown upon 's <eos> antigonus : their sacred wills be done <eos> go get aboard look to thy bark : i'll not be long before i call upon thee <eos> mariner : make your best haste and go not too far i' the land : 'tis like to be loud weather besides this place is famous for the creatures of prey that keep upon't <eos> antigonus : go thou away : i'll follow instantly <eos> mariner : i am glad at heart to be so rid o' the business <eos> antigonus : come poor babe : i have heard but not believed the spirits o' the dead may walk again : if such thing be thy mother appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream so like a waking <eos> to me comes a creature sometimes her head on one side some another i never saw a vessel of like sorrow so fill'd and so becoming : in pure white robes like very sanctity she did approach my cabin where i lay thrice bow'd before me and gasping to begin some speech her eyes became two spouts : the fury spent anon did this break-from her : 'good antigonus since fate against thy better disposition hath made thy person for the thrower-out of my poor babe according to thine oath places remote enough are in bohemia there weep and leave it crying and for the babe is counted lost for ever perdita i prithee call't <eos> for this ungentle business put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see thy wife paulina more <eos>' and so with shrieks she melted into air <eos> affrighted much i did in time collect myself and thought this was so and no slumber <eos> dreams are toys : yet for this once yea superstitiously i will be squared by this <eos> i do believe hermione hath suffer'd death and that apollo would this being indeed the issue of king polixenes it should here be laid either for life or death upon the earth of its right father <eos> blossom speed thee well <eos> there lie and there thy character : there these which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty and still rest thine <eos> the storm begins poor wretch that for thy mother's fault art thus exposed to loss and what may follow <eos> weep i cannot but my heart bleeds and most accursed am i to be by oath enjoin'd to this <eos> farewell <eos> the day frowns more and more : thou'rt like to have a lullaby too rough : i never saw the heavens so dim by day <eos> a savage clamour <eos> well may i get aboard <eos> this is the chase : i am gone for ever <eos> shepherd : i would there were no age between sixteen and three-and-twenty or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry stealing fighting <eos>hark you now <eos> would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather <eos> they have scared away two of my best sheep which i fear the wolf will sooner find than the master : if any where i have them 'tis by the seaside browsing of ivy <eos> good luck an't be thy will what have we here <eos> mercy on 's a barne a very pretty barne <eos> a boy or a child i wonder <eos> a pretty one a very pretty one : sure some 'scape : though i am not bookish yet i can read waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape <eos> this has been some stair-work some trunk-work some behind-door-work : they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here <eos> i'll take it up for pity : yet i'll tarry till my son come he hallooed but even now <eos> whoa ho hoa <eos> clown : hilloa loa <eos> shepherd : what art so near <eos> if thou'lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten come hither <eos> what ailest thou man <eos> clown : i have seen two such sights by sea and by land <eos> but i am not to say it is a sea for it is now the sky : betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin's point <eos> shepherd : why boy how is it <eos> clown : i would you did but see how it chafes how it rages how it takes up the shore <eos> but that's not the point <eos> o the most piteous cry of the poor souls <eos> sometimes to see 'em and not to see 'em now the ship boring the moon with her main-mast and anon swallowed with yest and froth as you'ld thrust a cork into a hogshead <eos> and then for the land-service to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone how he cried to me for help and said his name was antigonus a nobleman <eos> but to make an end of the ship to see how the sea flap-dragoned it : but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than the sea or weather <eos> shepherd : name of mercy when was this boy <eos> clown : now now : i have not winked since i saw these sights : the men are not yet cold under water nor the bear half dined on the gentleman : he's at it now <eos> shepherd : would i had been by to have helped the old man <eos> clown : i would you had been by the ship side to have helped her : there your charity would have lacked footing <eos> shepherd : heavy matters <eos> heavy matters <eos> but look thee here boy <eos> now bless thyself : thou mettest with things dying i with things newborn <eos> here's a sight for thee look thee a bearing-cloth for a squire's child <eos> look thee here take up take up boy open't <eos> so let's see : it was told me i should be rich by the fairies <eos> this is some changeling : open't <eos> what's within boy <eos> clown : you're a made old man : if the sins of your youth are forgiven you you're well to live <eos> gold <eos> all gold <eos> shepherd : this is fairy gold boy and 'twill prove so : up with't keep it close : home home the next way <eos> we are lucky boy and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy <eos> let my sheep go : come good boy the next way home <eos> clown : go you the next way with your findings <eos> i'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten : they are never curst but when they are hungry : if there be any of him left i'll bury it <eos> shepherd : that's a good deed <eos> if thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is fetch me to the sight of him <eos> clown : marry will i and you shall help to put him i' the ground <eos> shepherd : 'tis a lucky day boy and we'll do good deeds on't <eos> time : i that please some try all both joy and terror of good and bad that makes and unfolds error now take upon me in the name of time to use my wings <eos> impute it not a crime to me or my swift passage that i slide o'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried of that wide gap since it is in my power to o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour to plant and o'erwhelm custom <eos> let me pass the same i am ere ancient'st order was or what is now received : i witness to the times that brought them in so shall i do to the freshest things now reigning and make stale the glistering of this present as my tale now seems to it <eos> your patience this allowing i turn my glass and give my scene such growing as you had slept between : leontes leaving the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving that he shuts up himself imagine me gentle spectators that i now may be in fair bohemia and remember well i mentioned a son o' the king's which florizel i now name to you and with speed so pace to speak of perdita now grown in grace equal with wondering : what of her ensues i list not prophecy but let time's news be known when 'tis brought forth <eos> a shepherd's daughter and what to her adheres which follows after is the argument of time <eos> of this allow if ever you have spent time worse ere now if never yet that time himself doth say he wishes earnestly you never may <eos> polixenes : i pray thee good camillo be no more importunate : 'tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to grant this <eos> camillo : it is fifteen years since i saw my country : though i have for the most part been aired abroad i desire to lay my bones there <eos> besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay or i o'erween to think so which is another spur to my departure <eos> polixenes : as thou lovest me camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now : the need i have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee : thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if i have not enough considered as too much i cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships <eos> of that fatal country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented <eos> say to me when sawest thou the prince florizel my son <eos> kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues <eos> camillo : sir it is three days since i saw the prince <eos> what his happier affairs may be are to me unknown : but i have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared <eos> polixenes : i have considered so much camillo and with some care so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom i have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate <eos> camillo : i have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note : the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage <eos> polixenes : that's likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the angle that plucks our son thither <eos> thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither <eos> prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of sicilia <eos> camillo : i willingly obey your command <eos> polixenes : my best camillo <eos> we must disguise ourselves <eos> autolycus : when daffodils begin to peer with heigh <eos> the doxy over the dale why then comes in the sweet o' the year for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale <eos> the white sheet bleaching on the hedge with heigh <eos> the sweet birds o how they sing <eos> doth set my pugging tooth on edge for a quart of ale is a dish for a king <eos> the lark that tirra-lyra chants with heigh <eos> with heigh <eos> the thrush and the jay are summer songs for me and my aunts while we lie tumbling in the hay <eos> i have served prince florizel and in my time wore three-pile but now i am out of service : but shall i go mourn for that my dear <eos> the pale moon shines by night : and when i wander here and there i then do most go right <eos> if tinkers may have leave to live and bear the sow-skin budget then my account i well may give and in the stocks avouch it <eos> my traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen <eos> my father named me autolycus who being as i am littered under mercury was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles <eos> with die and drab i purchased this caparison and my revenue is the silly cheat <eos> gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway : beating and hanging are terrors to me : for the life to come i sleep out the thought of it <eos> a prize <eos> a prize <eos> clown : let me see : every 'leven wether tods every tod yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred shorn <eos> what comes the wool to <eos> autolycus : clown : i cannot do't without counters <eos> let me see what am i to buy for our sheep-shearing feast <eos> three pound of sugar five pound of currants rice <eos>what will this sister of mine do with rice <eos> but my father hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it on <eos> she hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for the shearers three-man-song-men all and very good ones but they are most of them means and bases but one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to horn-pipes <eos> i must have saffron to colour the warden pies mace dates <eos> <eos>none that's out of my note nutmegs seven a race or two of ginger but that i may beg four pound of prunes and as many of raisins o' the sun <eos> autolycus : o that ever i was born <eos> clown : i' the name of me <eos> autolycus : o help me help me <eos> pluck but off these rags and then death death <eos> clown : alack poor soul <eos> thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off <eos> autolycus : o sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes i have received which are mighty ones and millions <eos> clown : alas poor man <eos> a million of beating may come to a great matter <eos> autolycus : i am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel ta'en from me and these detestable things put upon me <eos> clown : what by a horseman or a footman <eos> autolycus : a footman sweet sir a footman <eos> clown : indeed he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee : if this be a horseman's coat it hath seen very hot service <eos> lend me thy hand i'll help thee : come lend me thy hand <eos> autolycus : o good sir tenderly o <eos> clown : alas poor soul <eos> autolycus : o good sir softly good sir <eos> i fear sir my shoulder-blade is out <eos> clown : how now <eos> canst stand <eos> autolycus : clown : dost lack any money <eos> i have a little money for thee <eos> autolycus : no good sweet sir no i beseech you sir : i have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence unto whom i was going i shall there have money or any thing i want : offer me no money i pray you that kills my heart <eos> clown : what manner of fellow was he that robbed you <eos> autolycus : a fellow sir that i have known to go about with troll-my-dames i knew him once a servant of the prince : i cannot tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court <eos> clown : his vices you would say there's no virtue whipped out of the court : they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide <eos> autolycus : vices i would say sir <eos> i know this man well : he hath been since an ape-bearer then a process-server a bailiff then he compassed a motion of the prodigal son and married a tinker's wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue : some call him autolycus <eos> clown : out upon him <eos> prig for my life prig : he haunts wakes fairs and bear-baitings <eos> autolycus : very true sir he sir he that's the rogue that put me into this apparel <eos> clown : not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia : if you had but looked big and spit at him he'ld have run <eos> autolycus : i must confess to you sir i am no fighter : i am false of heart that way and that he knew i warrant him <eos> clown : how do you now <eos> autolycus : sweet sir much better than i was i can stand and walk : i will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman's <eos> clown : shall i bring thee on the way <eos> autolycus : no good-faced sir no sweet sir <eos> clown : then fare thee well : i must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing <eos> autolycus : prosper you sweet sir <eos> your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice <eos> i'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too : if i make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue <eos> jog on jog on the foot-path way and merrily hent the stile-a : a merry heart goes all the day your sad tires in a mile-a <eos> florizel : these your unusual weeds to each part of you do give a life : no shepherdess but flora peering in april's front <eos> this your sheep-shearing is as a meeting of the petty gods and you the queen on't <eos> perdita : sir my gracious lord to chide at your extremes it not becomes me : o pardon that i name them <eos> your high self the gracious mark o' the land you have obscured with a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid most goddess-like prank'd up : but that our feasts in every mess have folly and the feeders digest it with a custom i should blush to see you so attired sworn i think to show myself a glass <eos> florizel : i bless the time when my good falcon made her flight across thy father's ground <eos> perdita : now jove afford you cause <eos> to me the difference forges dread your greatness hath not been used to fear <eos> even now i tremble to think your father by some accident should pass this way as you did : o the fates <eos> how would he look to see his work so noble vilely bound up <eos> what would he say <eos> or how should i in these my borrow'd flaunts behold the sternness of his presence <eos> florizel : apprehend nothing but jollity <eos> the gods themselves humbling their deities to love have taken the shapes of beasts upon them : jupiter became a bull and bellow'd the green neptune a ram and bleated and the fire-robed god golden apollo a poor humble swain as i seem now <eos> their transformations were never for a piece of beauty rarer nor in a way so chaste since my desires run not before mine honour nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith <eos> perdita : o but sir your resolution cannot hold when 'tis opposed as it must be by the power of the king : one of these two must be necessities which then will speak that you must change this purpose or i my life <eos> florizel : thou dearest perdita with these forced thoughts i prithee darken not the mirth o' the feast <eos> or i'll be thine my fair or not my father's <eos> for i cannot be mine own nor any thing to any if i be not thine <eos> to this i am most constant though destiny say no <eos> be merry gentle strangle such thoughts as these with any thing that you behold the while <eos> your guests are coming : lift up your countenance as it were the day of celebration of that nuptial which we two have sworn shall come <eos> perdita : o lady fortune stand you auspicious <eos> florizel : see your guests approach : address yourself to entertain them sprightly and let's be red with mirth <eos> shepherd : fie daughter <eos> when my old wife lived upon this day she was both pantler butler cook both dame and servant welcomed all served all would sing her song and dance her turn now here at upper end o' the table now i' the middle on his shoulder and his her face o' fire with labour and the thing she took to quench it she would to each one sip <eos> you are retired as if you were a feasted one and not the hostess of the meeting : pray you bid these unknown friends to's welcome for it is a way to make us better friends more known <eos> come quench your blushes and present yourself that which you are mistress o' the feast : come on and bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing as your good flock shall prosper <eos> perdita : polixenes : shepherdess a fair one are you <eos>well you fit our ages with flowers of winter <eos> perdita : sir the year growing ancient not yet on summer's death nor on the birth of trembling winter the fairest flowers o' the season are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors which some call nature's bastards : of that kind our rustic garden's barren and i care not to get slips of them <eos> polixenes : wherefore gentle maiden do you neglect them <eos> perdita : for i have heard it said there is an art which in their piedness shares with great creating nature <eos> polixenes : say there be yet nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean : so over that art which you say adds to nature is an art that nature makes <eos> you see sweet maid we marry a gentler scion to the wildest stock and make conceive a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler race : this is an art which does mend nature change it rather but the art itself is nature <eos> perdita : so it is <eos> polixenes : then make your garden rich in gillyvors and do not call them bastards <eos> perdita : i'll not put the dibble in earth to set one slip of them no more than were i painted i would wish this youth should say 'twere well and only therefore desire to breed by me <eos> here's flowers for you hot lavender mints savoury marjoram the marigold that goes to bed wi' the sun and with him rises weeping : these are flowers of middle summer and i think they are given to men of middle age <eos> you're very welcome <eos> camillo : i should leave grazing were i of your flock and only live by gazing <eos> perdita : out alas <eos> you'd be so lean that blasts of january would blow you through and through <eos> now my fair'st friend i would i had some flowers o' the spring that might become your time of day and yours and yours that wear upon your virgin branches yet your maidenheads growing : o proserpina for the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall from dis's waggon <eos> daffodils that come before the swallow dares and take the winds of march with beauty violets dim but sweeter than the lids of juno's eyes or cytherea's breath pale primroses that die unmarried ere they can behold bight phoebus in his strength <eos>a malady most incident to maids bold oxlips and the crown imperial lilies of all kinds the flower-de-luce being one <eos> o these i lack to make you garlands of and my sweet friend to strew him o'er and o'er <eos> florizel : what like a corse <eos> perdita : no like a bank for love to lie and play on not like a corse or if not to be buried but quick and in mine arms <eos> come take your flowers : methinks i play as i have seen them do in whitsun pastorals : sure this robe of mine does change my disposition <eos> florizel : what you do still betters what is done <eos> when you speak sweet <eos> i'ld have you do it ever : when you sing i'ld have you buy and sell so so give alms pray so and for the ordering your affairs to sing them too : when you do dance i wish you a wave o' the sea that you might ever do nothing but that move still still so and own no other function : each your doing so singular in each particular crowns what you are doing in the present deed that all your acts are queens <eos> perdita : o doricles your praises are too large : but that your youth and the true blood which peepeth fairly through't do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd with wisdom i might fear my doricles you woo'd me the false way <eos> florizel : i think you have as little skill to fear as i have purpose to put you to't <eos> but come our dance i pray : your hand my perdita : so turtles pair that never mean to part <eos> perdita : i'll swear for 'em <eos> polixenes : this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever ran on the green-sward : nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than herself too noble for this place <eos> camillo : he tells her something that makes her blood look out : good sooth she is the queen of curds and cream <eos> clown : come on strike up <eos> dorcas : mopsa must be your mistress : marry garlic to mend her kissing with <eos> mopsa : now in good time <eos> clown : not a word a word we stand upon our manners <eos> come strike up <eos> polixenes : pray good shepherd what fair swain is this which dances with your daughter <eos> shepherd : they call him doricles and boasts himself to have a worthy feeding : but i have it upon his own report and i believe it he looks like sooth <eos> he says he loves my daughter : i think so too for never gazed the moon upon the water as he'll stand and read as 'twere my daughter's eyes : and to be plain <eos> i think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best <eos> polixenes : she dances featly <eos> shepherd : so she does any thing though i report it that should be silent : if young doricles do light upon her she shall bring him that which he not dreams of <eos> servant : o master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you would never dance again after a tabour and pipe no the bagpipe could not move you : he sings several tunes faster than you'll tell money he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's ears grew to his tunes <eos> clown : he could never come better he shall come in <eos> i love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably <eos> servant : he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves : he has the prettiest love-songs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with such delicate burthens of dildos and fadings 'jump her and thump her' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the maid to answer 'whoop do me no harm good man' puts him off slights him with 'whoop do me no harm good man <eos>' polixenes : this is a brave fellow <eos> clown : believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow <eos> has he any unbraided wares <eos> servant : he hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can learnedly handle though they come to him by the gross : inkles caddisses cambrics lawns : why he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses you would think a smock were a she-angel he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't <eos> clown : prithee bring him in and let him approach singing <eos> perdita : forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes <eos> clown : you have of these pedlars that have more in them than you'ld think sister <eos> perdita : ay good brother or go about to think <eos> autolycus : lawn as white as driven snow cyprus black as e'er was crow gloves as sweet as damask roses masks for faces and for noses bugle bracelet necklace amber perfume for a lady's chamber golden quoifs and stomachers for my lads to give their dears : pins and poking-sticks of steel what maids lack from head to heel : come buy of me come come buy come buy buy lads or else your lasses cry : come buy <eos> clown : if i were not in love with mopsa thou shouldst take no money of me but being enthralled as i am it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves <eos> mopsa : i was promised them against the feast but they come not too late now <eos> dorcas : he hath promised you more than that or there be liars <eos> mopsa : he hath paid you all he promised you may be he has paid you more which will shame you to give him again <eos> clown : is there no manners left among maids <eos> will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces <eos> is there not milking-time when you are going to bed or kiln-hole to whistle off these secrets but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests <eos> 'tis well they are whispering : clamour your tongues and not a word more <eos> mopsa : i have done <eos> come you promised me a tawdry-lace and a pair of sweet gloves <eos> clown : have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way and lost all my money <eos> autolycus : and indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it behoves men to be wary <eos> clown : fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here <eos> autolycus : i hope so sir for i have about me many parcels of charge <eos> clown : what hast here <eos> ballads <eos> mopsa : pray now buy some : i love a ballad in print o' life for then we are sure they are true <eos> autolycus : here's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and toads carbonadoed <eos> mopsa : is it true think you <eos> autolycus : very true and but a month old <eos> dorcas : bless me from marrying a usurer <eos> autolycus : here's the midwife's name to't one mistress tale-porter and five or six honest wives that were present <eos> why should i carry lies abroad <eos> mopsa : pray you now buy it <eos> clown : come on lay it by : and let's first see moe ballads we'll buy the other things anon <eos> autolycus : here's another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on wednesday the four-score of april forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids : it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her : the ballad is very pitiful and as true <eos> dorcas : is it true too think you <eos> autolycus : five justices' hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold <eos> clown : lay it by too : another <eos> autolycus : this is a merry ballad but a very pretty one <eos> mopsa : let's have some merry ones <eos> autolycus : why this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of 'two maids wooing a man :' there's scarce a maid westward but she sings it 'tis in request i can tell you <eos> mopsa : we can both sing it : if thou'lt bear a part thou shalt hear 'tis in three parts <eos> dorcas : we had the tune on't a month ago <eos> autolycus : i can bear my part you must know 'tis my occupation have at it with you <eos> autolycus : get you hence for i must go where it fits not you to know <eos> dorcas : whither <eos> mopsa : o whither <eos> dorcas : whither <eos> mopsa : it becomes thy oath full well thou to me thy secrets tell <eos> dorcas : me too let me go thither <eos> mopsa : or thou goest to the orange or mill <eos> dorcas : if to either thou dost ill <eos> autolycus : neither <eos> dorcas : what neither <eos> autolycus : neither <eos> dorcas : thou hast sworn my love to be <eos> mopsa : thou hast sworn it more to me : then whither goest <eos> say whither <eos> clown : we'll have this song out anon by ourselves : my father and the gentlemen are in sad talk and we'll not trouble them <eos> come bring away thy pack after me <eos> wenches i'll buy for you both <eos> pedlar let's have the first choice <eos> follow me girls <eos> autolycus : and you shall pay well for 'em <eos> will you buy any tape or lace for your cape my dainty duck my dear-a <eos> any silk any thread any toys for your head of the new'st and finest finest wear-a <eos> come to the pedlar money's a medler <eos> that doth utter all men's ware-a <eos> servant : master there is three carters three shepherds three neat-herds three swine-herds that have made themselves all men of hair they call themselves saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are not in't but they themselves are o' the mind if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling it will please plentifully <eos> shepherd : away <eos> we'll none on 't : here has been too much homely foolery already <eos> i know sir we weary you <eos> polixenes : you weary those that refresh us : pray let's see these four threes of herdsmen <eos> servant : one three of them by their own report sir hath danced before the king and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier <eos> shepherd : leave your prating : since these good men are pleased let them come in but quickly now <eos> servant : why they stay at door sir <eos> polixenes : o father you'll know more of that hereafter <eos> is it not too far gone <eos> 'tis time to part them <eos> he's simple and tells much <eos> how now fair shepherd <eos> your heart is full of something that does take your mind from feasting <eos> sooth when i was young and handed love as you do i was wont to load my she with knacks : i would have ransack'd the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it to her acceptance you have let him go and nothing marted with him <eos> if your lass interpretation should abuse and call this your lack of love or bounty you were straited for a reply at least if you make a care of happy holding her <eos> florizel : old sir i know she prizes not such trifles as these are : the gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd up in my heart which i have given already but not deliver'd <eos> o hear me breathe my life before this ancient sir who it should seem hath sometime loved <eos> i take thy hand this hand as soft as dove's down and as white as it or ethiopian's tooth or the fann'd snow that's bolted by the northern blasts twice o'er <eos> polixenes : what follows this <eos> how prettily the young swain seems to wash the hand was fair before <eos> i have put you out : but to your protestation let me hear what you profess <eos> florizel : do and be witness to 't <eos> polixenes : and this my neighbour too <eos> florizel : and he and more than he and men the earth the heavens and all : that were i crown'd the most imperial monarch thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge more than was ever man's i would not prize them without her love for her employ them all commend them and condemn them to her service or to their own perdition <eos> polixenes : fairly offer'd <eos> camillo : this shows a sound affection <eos> shepherd : but my daughter say you the like to him <eos> perdita : i cannot speak so well nothing so well no nor mean better : by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out the purity of his <eos> shepherd : take hands a bargain <eos> and friends unknown you shall bear witness to 't : i give my daughter to him and will make her portion equal his <eos> florizel : o that must be i' the virtue of your daughter : one being dead i shall have more than you can dream of yet enough then for your wonder <eos> but come on contract us 'fore these witnesses <eos> shepherd : come your hand and daughter yours <eos> polixenes : soft swain awhile beseech you have you a father <eos> florizel : i have : but what of him <eos> polixenes : knows he of this <eos> florizel : he neither does nor shall <eos> polixenes : methinks a father is at the nuptial of his son a guest that best becomes the table <eos> pray you once more is not your father grown incapable of reasonable affairs <eos> is he not stupid with age and altering rheums <eos> can he speak <eos> hear <eos> know man from man <eos> dispute his own estate <eos> lies he not bed-rid <eos> and again does nothing but what he did being childish <eos> florizel : no good sir he has his health and ampler strength indeed than most have of his age <eos> polixenes : by my white beard you offer him if this be so a wrong something unfilial : reason my son should choose himself a wife but as good reason the father all whose joy is nothing else but fair posterity should hold some counsel in such a business <eos> florizel : i yield all this but for some other reasons my grave sir which 'tis not fit you know i not acquaint my father of this business <eos> polixenes : let him know't <eos> florizel : he shall not <eos> polixenes : prithee let him <eos> florizel : no he must not <eos> shepherd : let him my son : he shall not need to grieve at knowing of thy choice <eos> florizel : come come he must not <eos> mark our contract <eos> polixenes : mark your divorce young sir whom son i dare not call thou art too base to be acknowledged : thou a sceptre's heir that thus affect'st a sheep-hook <eos> thou old traitor i am sorry that by hanging thee i can but shorten thy life one week <eos> and thou fresh piece of excellent witchcraft who of force must know the royal fool thou copest with <eos> shepherd : o my heart <eos> polixenes : i'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made more homely than thy state <eos> for thee fond boy if i may ever know thou dost but sigh that thou no more shalt see this knack as never i mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession not hold thee of our blood no not our kin far than deucalion off : mark thou my words : follow us to the court <eos> thou churl for this time though full of our displeasure yet we free thee from the dead blow of it <eos> and you enchantment <eos> <eos> worthy enough a herdsman : yea him too that makes himself but for our honour therein unworthy thee <eos>if ever henceforth thou these rural latches to his entrance open or hoop his body more with thy embraces i will devise a death as cruel for thee as thou art tender to't <eos> perdita : even here undone <eos> i was not much afeard for once or twice i was about to speak and tell him plainly the selfsame sun that shines upon his court hides not his visage from our cottage but looks on alike <eos> will't please you sir be gone <eos> i told you what would come of this : beseech you of your own state take care : this dream of mine <eos> being now awake i'll queen it no inch farther but milk my ewes and weep <eos> camillo : why how now father <eos> speak ere thou diest <eos> shepherd : i cannot speak nor think nor dare to know that which i know <eos> o sir <eos> you have undone a man of fourscore three that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea to die upon the bed my father died to lie close by his honest bones : but now some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me where no priest shovels in dust <eos> o cursed wretch that knew'st this was the prince and wouldst adventure to mingle faith with him <eos> undone <eos> undone <eos> if i might die within this hour i have lived to die when i desire <eos> florizel : why look you so upon me <eos> i am but sorry not afeard delay'd but nothing alter'd : what i was i am more straining on for plucking back not following my leash unwillingly <eos> camillo : gracious my lord you know your father's temper : at this time he will allow no speech which i do guess you do not purpose to him and as hardly will he endure your sight as yet i fear : then till the fury of his highness settle come not before him <eos> florizel : i not purpose it <eos> i think camillo <eos> camillo : even he my lord <eos> perdita : how often have i told you 'twould be thus <eos> how often said my dignity would last but till 'twere known <eos> florizel : it cannot fail but by the violation of my faith and then let nature crush the sides o' the earth together and mar the seeds within <eos> lift up thy looks : from my succession wipe me father i am heir to my affection <eos> camillo : be advised <eos> florizel : i am and by my fancy : if my reason will thereto be obedient i have reason if not my senses better pleased with madness do bid it welcome <eos> camillo : this is desperate sir <eos> florizel : so call it : but it does fulfil my vow i needs must think it honesty <eos> camillo not for bohemia nor the pomp that may be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides in unknown fathoms will i break my oath to this my fair beloved : therefore i pray you as you have ever been my father's honour'd friend when he shall miss me <eos>as in faith i mean not to see him any more <eos>cast your good counsels upon his passion let myself and fortune tug for the time to come <eos> this you may know and so deliver i am put to sea with her whom here i cannot hold on shore and most opportune to our need i have a vessel rides fast by but not prepared for this design <eos> what course i mean to hold shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor concern me the reporting <eos> camillo : o my lord <eos> i would your spirit were easier for advice or stronger for your need <eos> florizel : hark perdita i'll hear you by and by <eos> camillo : he's irremoveable resolved for flight <eos> now were i happy if his going i could frame to serve my turn save him from danger do him love and honour purchase the sight again of dear sicilia and that unhappy king my master whom i so much thirst to see <eos> florizel : now good camillo i am so fraught with curious business that i leave out ceremony <eos> camillo : sir i think you have heard of my poor services i' the love that i have borne your father <eos> florizel : very nobly have you deserved : it is my father's music to speak your deeds not little of his care to have them recompensed as thought on <eos> camillo : well my lord if you may please to think i love the king and through him what is nearest to him which is your gracious self embrace but my direction : if your more ponderous and settled project may suffer alteration on mine honour i'll point you where you shall have such receiving as shall become your highness where you may enjoy your mistress from the whom i see there's no disjunction to be made but by <eos> as heavens forefend <eos> <eos>your ruin marry her and with my best endeavours in your absence your discontenting father strive to qualify and bring him up to liking <eos> florizel : how camillo may this almost a miracle be done <eos> that i may call thee something more than man and after that trust to thee <eos> camillo : have you thought on a place whereto you'll go <eos> florizel : not any yet : but as the unthought-on accident is guilty to what we wildly do so we profess ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies of every wind that blows <eos> camillo : then list to me : this follows if you will not change your purpose but undergo this flight make for sicilia and there present yourself and your fair princess for so i see she must be 'fore leontes : she shall be habited as it becomes the partner of your bed <eos> methinks i see leontes opening his free arms and weeping his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness as 'twere i' the father's person kisses the hands of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him 'twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one he chides to hell and bids the other grow faster than thought or time <eos> florizel : worthy camillo what colour for my visitation shall i hold up before him <eos> camillo : sent by the king your father to greet him and to give him comforts <eos> sir the manner of your bearing towards him with what you as from your father shall deliver things known betwixt us three i'll write you down : the which shall point you forth at every sitting what you must say that he shall not perceive but that you have your father's bosom there and speak his very heart <eos> florizel : i am bound to you : there is some sap in this <eos> camillo : a cause more promising than a wild dedication of yourselves to unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain to miseries enough no hope to help you but as you shake off one to take another nothing so certain as your anchors who do their best office if they can but stay you where you'll be loath to be : besides you know prosperity's the very bond of love whose fresh complexion and whose heart together affliction alters <eos> perdita : one of these is true : i think affliction may subdue the cheek but not take in the mind <eos> camillo : yea say you so <eos> there shall not at your father's house these seven years be born another such <eos> florizel : my good camillo she is as forward of her breeding as she is i' the rear our birth <eos> camillo : i cannot say 'tis pity she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress to most that teach <eos> perdita : your pardon sir for this i'll blush you thanks <eos> florizel : my prettiest perdita <eos> but o the thorns we stand upon <eos> camillo preserver of my father now of me the medicine of our house how shall we do <eos> we are not furnish'd like bohemia's son nor shall appear in sicilia <eos> camillo : my lord fear none of this : i think you know my fortunes do all lie there : it shall be so my care to have you royally appointed as if the scene you play were mine <eos> for instance sir that you may know you shall not want one word <eos> autolycus : ha ha <eos> what a fool honesty is <eos> and trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman <eos> i have sold all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch table-book ballad knife tape glove shoe-tie bracelet horn-ring to keep my pack from fasting : they throng who should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer : by which means i saw whose purse was best in picture and what i saw to my good use i remembered <eos> my clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears : you might have pinched a placket it was senseless 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse i could have filed keys off that hung in chains : no hearing no feeling but my sir's song and admiring the nothing of it <eos> so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not left a purse alive in the whole army <eos> camillo : nay but my letters by this means being there so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt <eos> florizel : and those that you'll procure from king leontes <eos> camillo : shall satisfy your father <eos> perdita : happy be you <eos> all that you speak shows fair <eos> camillo : who have we here <eos> we'll make an instrument of this omit nothing may give us aid <eos> autolycus : if they have overheard me now why hanging <eos> camillo : how now good fellow <eos> why shakest thou so <eos> fear not man here's no harm intended to thee <eos> autolycus : i am a poor fellow sir <eos> camillo : why be so still here's nobody will steal that from thee : yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly <eos>thou must think there's a necessity in't <eos>and change garments with this gentleman : though the pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee there's some boot <eos> autolycus : i am a poor fellow sir <eos> i know ye well enough <eos> camillo : nay prithee dispatch : the gentleman is half flayed already <eos> autolycus : are you in earnest sir <eos> i smell the trick on't <eos> florizel : dispatch i prithee <eos> autolycus : indeed i have had earnest : but i cannot with conscience take it <eos> camillo : unbuckle unbuckle <eos> fortunate mistress <eos>let my prophecy come home to ye <eos> <eos>you must retire yourself into some covert : take your sweetheart's hat and pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face dismantle you and as you can disliken the truth of your own seeming that you may <eos> for i do fear eyes over <eos>to shipboard get undescried <eos> perdita : i see the play so lies that i must bear a part <eos> camillo : no remedy <eos> have you done there <eos> florizel : should i now meet my father he would not call me son <eos> camillo : nay you shall have no hat <eos> come lady come <eos> farewell my friend <eos> autolycus : adieu sir <eos> florizel : o perdita what have we twain forgot <eos> pray you a word <eos> camillo : florizel : fortune speed us <eos> thus we set on camillo to the sea-side <eos> camillo : the swifter speed the better <eos> autolycus : i understand the business i hear it : to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cut-purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses <eos> i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive <eos> what an exchange had this been without boot <eos> what a boot is here with this exchange <eos> sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do any thing extempore <eos> the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels : if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not do't : i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession <eos> aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain : every lane's end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work <eos> clown : see see what a man you are now <eos> there is no other way but to tell the king she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood <eos> shepherd : nay but hear me <eos> clown : nay but hear me <eos> shepherd : go to then <eos> clown : she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him <eos> show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her : this being done let the law go whistle : i warrant you <eos> shepherd : i will tell the king all every word yea and his son's pranks too who i may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the king's brother-in-law <eos> clown : indeed brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by i know how much an ounce <eos> autolycus : shepherd : well let us to the king : there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard <eos> autolycus : clown : pray heartily he be at palace <eos> autolycus : shepherd : to the palace an it like your worship <eos> autolycus : your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and any thing that is fitting to be known discover <eos> clown : we are but plain fellows sir <eos> autolycus : a lie you are rough and hairy <eos> let me have no lying : it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie : but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie <eos> clown : your worship had like to have given us one if you had not taken yourself with the manner <eos> shepherd : are you a courtier an't like you sir <eos> autolycus : whether it like me or no i am a courtier <eos> seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings <eos> hath not my gait in it the measure of the court <eos> receives not thy nose court-odor from me <eos> reflect i not on thy baseness court-contempt <eos> thinkest thou for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy business i am therefore no courtier <eos> i am courtier cap-a-pe and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there : whereupon i command thee to open thy affair <eos> shepherd : my business sir is to the king <eos> autolycus : what advocate hast thou to him <eos> shepherd : i know not an't like you <eos> clown : advocate's the court-word for a pheasant : say you have none <eos> shepherd : none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen <eos> autolycus : how blessed are we that are not simple men <eos> yet nature might have made me as these are therefore i will not disdain <eos> clown : this cannot be but a great courtier <eos> shepherd : his garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely <eos> clown : he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical : a great man i'll warrant i know by the picking on's teeth <eos> autolycus : the fardel there <eos> what's i' the fardel <eos> wherefore that box <eos> shepherd : sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king and which he shall know within this hour if i may come to the speech of him <eos> autolycus : age thou hast lost thy labour <eos> shepherd : why sir <eos> autolycus : the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself : for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief <eos> shepard : so 'tis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherd's daughter <eos> autolycus : if that shepherd be not in hand-fast let him fly : the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster <eos> clown : think you so sir <eos> autolycus : not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman : which though it be great pity yet it is necessary <eos> an old sheep-whistling rogue a ram-tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace <eos> some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a sheep-cote <eos> all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy <eos> clown : has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear <eos> an't like you sir <eos> autolycus : he has a son who shall be flayed alive then 'nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasp's nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall be be set against a brick-wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death <eos> but what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offences being so capital <eos> tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king : being something gently considered i'll bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is man shall do it <eos> clown : he seems to be of great authority : close with him give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold : show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand and no more ado <eos> remember 'stoned' and 'flayed alive <eos>' shepherd : an't please you sir to undertake the business for us here is that gold i have : i'll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you <eos> autolycus : after i have done what i promised <eos> shepherd : ay sir <eos> autolycus : well give me the moiety <eos> are you a party in this business <eos> clown : in some sort sir : but though my case be a pitiful one i hope i shall not be flayed out of it <eos> autolycus : o that's the case of the shepherd's son : hang him he'll be made an example <eos> clown : comfort good comfort <eos> we must to the king and show our strange sights : he must know 'tis none of your daughter nor my sister we are gone else <eos> sir i will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed and remain as he says your pawn till it be brought you <eos> autolycus : i will trust you <eos> walk before toward the sea-side go on the right hand : i will but look upon the hedge and follow you <eos> clown : we are blest in this man as i may say even blest <eos> shepherd : let's before as he bids us : he was provided to do us good <eos> autolycus : if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would not suffer me : she drops booties in my mouth <eos> i am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement <eos> i will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him : if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to't <eos> to him will i present them : there may be matter in it <eos> cleomenes : sir you have done enough and have perform'd a saint-like sorrow : no fault could you make which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down more penitence than done trespass : at the last do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself <eos> leontes : whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man bred his hopes out of <eos> paulina : true too true my lord : if one by one you wedded all the world or from the all that are took something good to make a perfect woman she you kill'd would be unparallel'd <eos> leontes : i think so <eos> kill'd <eos> she i kill'd <eos> i did so : but thou strikest me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought : now good now say so but seldom <eos> cleomenes : not at all good lady : you might have spoken a thousand things that would have done the time more benefit and graced your kindness better <eos> paulina : you are one of those would have him wed again <eos> dion : if you would not so you pity not the state nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name consider little what dangers by his highness' fail of issue may drop upon his kingdom and devour incertain lookers on <eos> what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well <eos> what holier than for royalty's repair for present comfort and for future good to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow to't <eos> paulina : there is none worthy respecting her that's gone <eos> besides the gods will have fulfill'd their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said is't not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found <eos> which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant <eos> 'tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills <eos> care not for issue the crown will find an heir : great alexander left his to the worthiest so his successor was like to be the best <eos> leontes : good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honour o that ever i had squared me to thy counsel <eos> then even now i might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes have taken treasure from her lips <eos> paulina : and left them more rich for what they yielded <eos> leontes : thou speak'st truth <eos> no more such wives therefore no wife : one worse and better used would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we're offenders now appear soul-vex'd and begin 'why to me <eos>' paulina : had she such power she had just cause <eos> leontes : she had and would incense me to murder her i married <eos> paulina : i should so <eos> were i the ghost that walk'd i'ld bid you mark her eye and tell me for what dull part in't you chose her then i'ld shriek that even your ears should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd should be 'remember mine <eos>' leontes : stars stars and all eyes else dead coals <eos> fear thou no wife i'll have no wife paulina <eos> paulina : will you swear never to marry but by my free leave <eos> leontes : never paulina so be blest my spirit <eos> paulina : then good my lords bear witness to his oath <eos> cleomenes : you tempt him over-much <eos> paulina : unless another as like hermione as is her picture affront his eye <eos> cleomenes : good madam <eos> paulina : i have done <eos> yet if my lord will marry <eos>if you will sir no remedy but you will <eos>give me the office to choose you a queen : she shall not be so young as was your former but she shall be such as walk'd your first queen's ghost it should take joy to see her in your arms <eos> leontes : my true paulina we shall not marry till thou bid'st us <eos> paulina : that shall be when your first queen's again in breath never till then <eos> gentleman : one that gives out himself prince florizel son of polixenes with his princess she the fairest i have yet beheld desires access to your high presence <eos> leontes : what with him <eos> he comes not like to his father's greatness : his approach so out of circumstance and sudden tells us 'tis not a visitation framed but forced by need and accident <eos> what train <eos> gentleman : but few and those but mean <eos> leontes : his princess say you with him <eos> gentleman : ay the most peerless piece of earth i think that e'er the sun shone bright on <eos> paulina : o hermione as every present time doth boast itself above a better gone so must thy grave give way to what's seen now <eos> sir you yourself have said and writ so but your writing now is colder than that theme 'she had not been nor was not to be equall'd' <eos>thus your verse flow'd with her beauty once : 'tis shrewdly ebb'd to say you have seen a better <eos> gentleman : pardon madam : the one i have almost forgot <eos>your pardon <eos> the other when she has obtain'd your eye will have your tongue too <eos> this is a creature would she begin a sect might quench the zeal of all professors else make proselytes of who she but bid follow <eos> paulina : how <eos> not women <eos> gentleman : women will love her that she is a woman more worth than any man men that she is the rarest of all women <eos> leontes : go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honour'd friends bring them to our embracement <eos> still 'tis strange he thus should steal upon us <eos> paulina : had our prince jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd well with this lord : there was not full a month between their births <eos> leontes : prithee no more cease thou know'st he dies to me again when talk'd of : sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason <eos> they are come <eos> your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you : were i but twenty-one your father's image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us perform'd before <eos> most dearly welcome <eos> and your fair princess <eos>goddess <eos> <eos>o alas <eos> i lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do : and then i lost <eos> all mine own folly <eos>the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him <eos> florizel : by his command have i here touch'd sicilia and from him give you all greetings that a king at friend can send his brother : and but infirmity which waits upon worn times hath something seized his wish'd ability he had himself the lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his measured to look upon you whom he loves <eos> he bade me say so <eos>more than all the sceptres and those that bear them living <eos> leontes : o my brother good gentleman <eos> the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behind-hand slackness <eos> welcome hither as is the spring to the earth <eos> and hath he too exposed this paragon to the fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less the adventure of her person <eos> florizel : good my lord she came from libya <eos> leontes : where the warlike smalus that noble honour'd lord is fear'd and loved <eos> florizel : most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter his tears proclaim'd his parting with her : thence a prosperous south-wind friendly we have cross'd to execute the charge my father gave me for visiting your highness : my best train i have from your sicilian shores dismiss'd who for bohemia bend to signify not only my success in libya sir but my arrival and my wife's in safety here where we are <eos> leontes : the blessed gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here <eos> you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin : for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your father's blest as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness <eos> what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have look'd on such goodly things as you <eos> lord : most noble sir that which i shall report will bear no credit were not the proof so nigh <eos> please you great sir bohemia greets you from himself by me desires you to attach his son who has <eos> his dignity and duty both cast off <eos> fled from his father from his hopes and with a shepherd's daughter <eos> leontes : where's bohemia <eos> speak <eos> lord : here in your city i now came from him : i speak amazedly and it becomes my marvel and my message <eos> to your court whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems of this fair couple meets he on the way the father of this seeming lady and her brother having both their country quitted with this young prince <eos> florizel : camillo has betray'd me whose honour and whose honesty till now endured all weathers <eos> lord : lay't so to his charge : he's with the king your father <eos> leontes : who <eos> camillo <eos> lord : camillo sir i spake with him who now has these poor men in question <eos> never saw i wretches so quake : they kneel they kiss the earth forswear themselves as often as they speak : bohemia stops his ears and threatens them with divers deaths in death <eos> perdita : o my poor father <eos> the heaven sets spies upon us will not have our contract celebrated <eos> leontes : you are married <eos> florizel : we are not sir nor are we like to be the stars i see will kiss the valleys first : the odds for high and low's alike <eos> leontes : my lord is this the daughter of a king <eos> florizel : she is when once she is my wife <eos> leontes : that 'once' i see by your good father's speed will come on very slowly <eos> i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her <eos> florizel : dear look up : though fortune visible an enemy should chase us with my father power no jot hath she to change our loves <eos> beseech you sir remember since you owed no more to time than i do now : with thought of such affections step forth mine advocate at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles <eos> leontes : would he do so i'ld beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle <eos> paulina : sir my liege your eye hath too much youth in't : not a month 'fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now <eos> leontes : i thought of her even in these looks i made <eos> but your petition is yet unanswer'd <eos> i will to your father : your honour not o'erthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you : upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make : come good my lord <eos> autolycus : beseech you sir were you present at this relation <eos> first gentleman : i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it : whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child <eos> autolycus : i would most gladly know the issue of it <eos> first gentleman : i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration : they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed : a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be <eos> here comes a gentleman that haply knows more <eos> the news rogero <eos> second gentleman : nothing but bonfires : the oracle is fulfilled the king's daughter is found : such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it <eos> here comes the lady paulina's steward : he can deliver you more <eos> how goes it now sir <eos> this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion : has the king found his heir <eos> third gentleman : most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance : that which you hear you'll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs <eos> the mantle of queen hermione's her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king's daughter <eos> did you see the meeting of the two kings <eos> second gentleman : no <eos> third gentleman : then have you lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of <eos> there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears <eos> there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour <eos> our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries 'o thy mother thy mother <eos>' then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son-in-law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns <eos> i never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it <eos> second gentleman : what pray you became of antigonus that carried hence the child <eos> third gentleman : like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open <eos> he was torn to pieces with a bear : this avouches the shepherd's son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows <eos> first gentleman : what became of his bark and his followers <eos> third gentleman : wrecked the same instant of their master's death and in the view of the shepherd : so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found <eos> but o the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina <eos> she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled : she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing <eos> first gentleman : the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted <eos> third gentleman : one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queen's death with the manner how she came to't bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an 'alas' i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood <eos> who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed : if all the world could have seen 't the woe had been universal <eos> first gentleman : are they returned to the court <eos> third gentleman : no : the princess hearing of her mother's statue which is in the keeping of paulina <eos>a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master julio romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape : he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer : thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup <eos> second gentleman : i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house <eos> shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing <eos> first gentleman : who would be thence that has the benefit of access <eos> every wink of an eye some new grace will be born : our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge <eos> let's along <eos> autolycus : now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head <eos> i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince : told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what : but he at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much sea-sick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered <eos> but 'tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits <eos> here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune <eos> shepherd : come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born <eos> clown : you are well met sir <eos> you denied to fight with me this other day because i was no gentleman born <eos> see you these clothes <eos> say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born : you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born : give me the lie do and try whether i am not now a gentleman born <eos> autolycus : i know you are now sir a gentleman born <eos> clown : ay and have been so any time these four hours <eos> shepherd : and so have i boy <eos> clown : so you have : but i was a gentleman born before my father for the king's son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed <eos> shepherd : we may live son to shed many more <eos> clown : ay or else 'twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are <eos> autolycus : i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master <eos> shepherd : prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen <eos> clown : thou wilt amend thy life <eos> autolycus : ay an it like your good worship <eos> clown : give me thy hand : i will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia <eos> shepherd : you may say it but not swear it <eos> clown : not swear it now i am a gentleman <eos> let boors and franklins say it i'll swear it <eos> shepherd : how if it be false son <eos> clown : if it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend : and i'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk : but i'll swear it and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands <eos> autolycus : i will prove so sir to my power <eos> clown : ay by any means prove a tall fellow : if i do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not <eos> hark <eos> the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the queen's picture <eos> come follow us : we'll be thy good masters <eos> leontes : o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee <eos> paulina : what sovereign sir i did not well i meant well <eos> all my services you have paid home : but that you have vouchsafed with your crown'd brother and these your contracted heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit it is a surplus of your grace which never my life may last to answer <eos> leontes : o paulina we honour you with trouble : but we came to see the statue of our queen : your gallery have we pass'd through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother <eos> paulina : as she lived peerless so her dead likeness i do well believe excels whatever yet you look'd upon or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it lonely apart <eos> but here it is : prepare to see the life as lively mock'd as ever still sleep mock'd death : behold and say 'tis well <eos> i like your silence it the more shows off your wonder : but yet speak first you my liege comes it not something near <eos> leontes : her natural posture <eos> chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace <eos> but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so aged as this seems <eos> polixenes : o not by much <eos> paulina : so much the more our carver's excellence which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now <eos> leontes : as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul <eos> o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i woo'd her <eos> i am ashamed : does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it <eos> o royal piece there's magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee <eos> perdita : and give me leave and do not say 'tis superstition that i kneel and then implore her blessing <eos> lady dear queen that ended when i but began give me that hand of yours to kiss <eos> paulina : o patience <eos> the statue is but newly fix'd the colour's not dry <eos> camillo : my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on which sixteen winters cannot blow away so many summers dry scarce any joy did ever so long live no sorrow but kill'd itself much sooner <eos> polixenes : dear my brother let him that was the cause of this have power to take off so much grief from you as he will piece up in himself <eos> paulina : indeed my lord if i had thought the sight of my poor image would thus have wrought you <eos>for the stone is mine <eos> i'ld not have show'd it <eos> leontes : do not draw the curtain <eos> paulina : no longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy may think anon it moves <eos> leontes : let be let be <eos> would i were dead but that methinks already <eos> what was he that did make it <eos> see my lord would you not deem it breathed <eos> and that those veins did verily bear blood <eos> polixenes : masterly done : the very life seems warm upon her lip <eos> leontes : the fixture of her eye has motion in't as we are mock'd with art <eos> paulina : i'll draw the curtain : my lord's almost so far transported that he'll think anon it lives <eos> leontes : o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together <eos> no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness <eos> let 't alone <eos> paulina : i am sorry sir i have thus far stirr'd you : but i could afflict you farther <eos> leontes : do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort <eos> still methinks there is an air comes from her : what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath <eos> let no man mock me for i will kiss her <eos> paulina : good my lord forbear : the ruddiness upon her lip is wet you'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own with oily painting <eos> shall i draw the curtain <eos> leontes : no not these twenty years <eos> perdita : so long could i stand by a looker on <eos> paulina : either forbear quit presently the chapel or resolve you for more amazement <eos> if you can behold it i'll make the statue move indeed descend and take you by the hand but then you'll think <eos> which i protest against <eos>i am assisted by wicked powers <eos> leontes : what you can make her do i am content to look on : what to speak i am content to hear for 'tis as easy to make her speak as move <eos> paulina : it is required you do awake your faith <eos> then all stand still on : those that think it is unlawful business i am about let them depart <eos> leontes : proceed : no foot shall stir <eos> paulina : music awake her strike <eos> 'tis time descend be stone no more approach strike all that look upon with marvel <eos> come i'll fill your grave up : stir nay come away bequeath to death your numbness for from him dear life redeems you <eos> you perceive she stirs : start not her actions shall be holy as you hear my spell is lawful : do not shun her until you see her die again for then you kill her double <eos> nay present your hand : when she was young you woo'd her now in age is she become the suitor <eos> leontes : o she's warm <eos> if this be magic let it be an art lawful as eating <eos> polixenes : she embraces him <eos> camillo : she hangs about his neck : if she pertain to life let her speak too <eos> polixenes : ay and make't manifest where she has lived or how stolen from the dead <eos> paulina : that she is living were it but told you should be hooted at like an old tale : but it appears she lives though yet she speak not <eos> mark a little while <eos> please you to interpose fair madam : kneel and pray your mother's blessing <eos> turn good lady our perdita is found <eos> hermione : you gods look down and from your sacred vials pour your graces upon my daughter's head <eos> tell me mine own <eos> where hast thou been preserved <eos> where lived <eos> how found thy father's court <eos> for thou shalt hear that i knowing by paulina that the oracle gave hope thou wast in being have preserved myself to see the issue <eos> paulina : there's time enough for that lest they desire upon this push to trouble your joys with like relation <eos> go together you precious winners all your exultation partake to every one <eos> i an old turtle will wing me to some wither'd bough and there my mate that's never to be found again lament till i am lost <eos> leontes : o peace paulina <eos> thou shouldst a husband take by my consent as i by thine a wife : this is a match and made between's by vows <eos> thou hast found mine but how is to be question'd for i saw her as i thought dead and have in vain said many a prayer upon her grave <eos> i'll not seek far <eos> for him i partly know his mind <eos>to find thee an honourable husband <eos> come camillo and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty is richly noted and here justified by us a pair of kings <eos> let's from this place <eos> what <eos> look upon my brother : both your pardons that e'er i put between your holy looks my ill suspicion <eos> this is your son-in-law and son unto the king who heavens directing is troth-plight to your daughter <eos> good paulina lead us from hence where we may leisurely each one demand an answer to his part perform'd in this wide gap of time since first we were dissever'd : hastily lead away <eos> duke vincentio : escalus <eos> escalus : my lord <eos> duke vincentio : of government the properties to unfold would seem in me to affect speech and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you : then no more remains but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able and let them work <eos> the nature of our people our city's institutions and the terms for common justice you're as pregnant in as art and practise hath enriched any that we remember <eos> there is our commission from which we would not have you warp <eos> call hither i say bid come before us angelo <eos> what figure of us think you he will bear <eos> for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dress'd him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power : what think you of it <eos> escalus : if any in vienna be of worth to undergo such ample grace and honour it is lord angelo <eos> duke vincentio : look where he comes <eos> angelo : always obedient to your grace's will i come to know your pleasure <eos> duke vincentio : angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to the observer doth thy history fully unfold <eos> thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee <eos> heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us 'twere all alike as if we had them not <eos> spirits are not finely touch'd but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use <eos> but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo : <eos> in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart : old escalus though first in question is thy secondary <eos> take thy commission <eos> angelo : now good my lord let there be some more test made of my metal before so noble and so great a figure be stamp'd upon it <eos> duke vincentio : no more evasion : we have with a leaven'd and prepared choice proceeded to you therefore take your honours <eos> our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd matters of needful value <eos> we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here <eos> so fare you well to the hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions <eos> angelo : yet give leave my lord that we may bring you something on the way <eos> duke vincentio : my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honour have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good <eos> give me your hand : i'll privily away <eos> i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes : through it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it <eos> once more fare you well <eos> angelo : the heavens give safety to your purposes <eos> escalus : lead forth and bring you back in happiness <eos> duke : i thank you <eos> fare you well <eos> escalus : i shall desire you sir to give me leave to have free speech with you and it concerns me to look into the bottom of my place : a power i have but of what strength and nature i am not yet instructed <eos> angelo : 'tis so with me <eos> let us withdraw together and we may soon our satisfaction have touching that point <eos> escalus : i'll wait upon your honour <eos> lucio : if the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king <eos> first gentleman : heaven grant us its peace but not the king of hungary's <eos> second gentleman : amen <eos> lucio : thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped one out of the table <eos> second gentleman : 'thou shalt not steal' <eos> lucio : ay that he razed <eos> first gentleman : why 'twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions : they put forth to steal <eos> there's not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace <eos> second gentleman : i never heard any soldier dislike it <eos> lucio : i believe thee for i think thou never wast where grace was said <eos> second gentleman : no <eos> a dozen times at least <eos> first gentleman : what in metre <eos> lucio : in any proportion or in any language <eos> first gentleman : i think or in any religion <eos> lucio : ay why not <eos> grace is grace despite of all controversy : as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace <eos> first gentleman : well there went but a pair of shears between us <eos> lucio : i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet <eos> thou art the list <eos> first gentleman : and thou the velvet : thou art good velvet thou'rt a three-piled piece i warrant thee : i had as lief be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a french velvet <eos> do i speak feelingly now <eos> lucio : i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech : i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee <eos> first gentleman : i think i have done myself wrong have i not <eos> second gentleman : yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free <eos> lucio : behold behold <eos> where madam mitigation comes <eos> i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to <eos> second gentleman : to what i pray <eos> lucio : judge <eos> second gentleman : to three thousand dolours a year <eos> first gentleman : ay and more <eos> lucio : a french crown more <eos> first gentleman : thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error i am sound <eos> lucio : nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow : thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee <eos> first gentleman : how now <eos> which of your hips has the most profound sciatica <eos> mistress overdone : well well there's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all <eos> second gentleman : who's that i pray thee <eos> mistress overdone : marry sir that's claudio signior claudio <eos> first gentleman : claudio to prison <eos> 'tis not so <eos> mistress overdone : nay but i know 'tis so : i saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopped off <eos> lucio : but after all this fooling i would not have it so <eos> art thou sure of this <eos> mistress overdone : i am too sure of it : and it is for getting madam julietta with child <eos> lucio : believe me this may be : he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise-keeping <eos> second gentleman : besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose <eos> first gentleman : but most of all agreeing with the proclamation <eos> lucio : away <eos> let's go learn the truth of it <eos> mistress overdone : thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty i am custom-shrunk <eos> how now <eos> what's the news with you <eos> pompey : yonder man is carried to prison <eos> mistress overdone : well what has he done <eos> pompey : a woman <eos> mistress overdone : but what's his offence <eos> pompey : groping for trouts in a peculiar river <eos> mistress overdone : what is there a maid with child by him <eos> pompey : no but there's a woman with maid by him <eos> you have not heard of the proclamation have you <eos> mistress overdone : what proclamation man <eos> pompey : all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down <eos> mistress overdone : and what shall become of those in the city <eos> pompey : they shall stand for seed : they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them <eos> mistress overdone : but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down <eos> pompey : to the ground mistress <eos> mistress overdone : why here's a change indeed in the commonwealth <eos> what shall become of me <eos> pompey : come fear you not : good counsellors lack no clients : though you change your place you need not change your trade i'll be your tapster still <eos> courage <eos> there will be pity taken on you : you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered <eos> mistress overdone : what's to do here thomas tapster <eos> let's withdraw <eos> pompey : here comes signior claudio led by the provost to prison and there's madam juliet <eos> claudio : fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world <eos> bear me to prison where i am committed <eos> provost : i do it not in evil disposition but from lord angelo by special charge <eos> claudio : thus can the demigod authority make us pay down for our offence by weight the words of heaven on whom it will it will on whom it will not so yet still 'tis just <eos> lucio : why how now claudio <eos> whence comes this restraint <eos> claudio : from too much liberty my lucio liberty : as surfeit is the father of much fast so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint <eos> our natures do pursue like rats that ravin down their proper bane a thirsty evil and when we drink we die <eos> lucio : if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors : and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment <eos> what's thy offence claudio <eos> claudio : what but to speak of would offend again <eos> lucio : what is't murder <eos> claudio : no <eos> lucio : lechery <eos> claudio : call it so <eos> provost : away sir <eos> you must go <eos> claudio : one word good friend <eos> lucio a word with you <eos> lucio : a hundred if they'll do you any good <eos> is lechery so look'd after <eos> claudio : thus stands it with me : upon a true contract i got possession of julietta's bed : you know the lady she is fast my wife save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order : this we came not to only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us <eos> but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet <eos> lucio : with child perhaps <eos> claudio : unhappily even so <eos> and the new deputy now for the duke <eos> whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his emmence that fills it up i stagger in : <eos>but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me : 'tis surely for a name <eos> lucio : i warrant it is : and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off <eos> send after the duke and appeal to him <eos> claudio : i have done so but he's not to be found <eos> i prithee lucio do me this kind service : this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation : acquaint her with the danger of my state : implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him : i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as move men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade <eos> lucio : i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack <eos> i'll to her <eos> claudio : i thank you good friend lucio <eos> lucio : within two hours <eos> claudio : come officer away <eos> duke vincentio : no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom <eos> why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth <eos> friar thomas : may your grace speak of it <eos> duke vincentio : my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps <eos> i have deliver'd to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travell'd to poland for so i have strew'd it in the common ear and so it is received <eos> now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this <eos> friar thomas : gladly my lord <eos> duke vincentio : we have strict statutes and most biting laws <eos> the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this nineteen years we have let slip even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey <eos> now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their children's sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum <eos> friar thomas : it rested in your grace to unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased : and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd than in lord angelo <eos> duke vincentio : i do fear too dreadful : sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope 'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do : for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment <eos> therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in the ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander <eos> and to behold his sway i will as 'twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people : therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar <eos> more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one : lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone : hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be <eos> isabella : and have you nuns no farther privileges <eos> francisca : are not these large enough <eos> isabella : yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare <eos> lucio : isabella : who's that which calls <eos> francisca : it is a man's voice <eos> gentle isabella turn you the key and know his business of him you may i may not you are yet unsworn <eos> when you have vow'd you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress : then if you speak you must not show your face or if you show your face you must not speak <eos> he calls again i pray you answer him <eos> isabella : peace and prosperity <eos> who is't that calls lucio : hail virgin if you be as those cheek-roses proclaim you are no less <eos> can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio <eos> isabella : why 'her unhappy brother' <eos> let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister <eos> lucio : gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you : not to be weary with you he's in prison <eos> isabella : woe me <eos> for what <eos> lucio : for that which if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks : he hath got his friend with child <eos> isabella : sir make me not your story <eos> lucio : it is true <eos> i would not <eos>though 'tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heart <eos>play with all virgins so : i hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted <eos> by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talk'd with in sincerity as with a saint <eos> isabella : you do blaspheme the good in mocking me <eos> lucio : do not believe it <eos> fewness and truth 'tis thus : your brother and his lover have embraced : as those that feed grow full as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry <eos> isabella : some one with child by him <eos> my cousin juliet <eos> lucio : is she your cousin <eos> isabella : adoptedly as school-maids change their names by vain though apt affection <eos> lucio : she it is <eos> isabella : o let him marry her <eos> lucio : this is the point <eos> the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action : but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givings-out were of an infinite distance from his true-meant design <eos> upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snow-broth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast <eos> he <eos>to give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions <eos>hath pick'd out an act under whose heavy sense your brother's life falls into forfeit : he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example <eos> all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo : and that's my pith of business 'twixt you and your poor brother <eos> isabella : doth he so seek his life <eos> lucio : has censured him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for his execution <eos> isabella : alas <eos> what poor ability's in me to do him good <eos> lucio : assay the power you have <eos> isabella : my power <eos> alas i doubt <eos> lucio : our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt <eos> go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them <eos> isabella : i'll see what i can do <eos> lucio : but speedily <eos> isabella : i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair <eos> i humbly thank you : commend me to my brother : soon at night i'll send him certain word of my success <eos> lucio : i take my leave of you <eos> isabella : good sir adieu <eos> angelo : we must not make a scarecrow of the law setting it up to fear the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not their terror <eos> escalus : ay but yet let us be keen and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to death <eos> alas this gentleman whom i would save had a most noble father <eos> let but your honour know whom i believe to be most strait in virtue that in the working of your own affections had time cohered with place or place with wishing or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose whether you had not sometime in your life err'd in this point which now you censure him and pull'd the law upon you <eos> angelo : 'tis one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall <eos> i not deny the jury passing on the prisoner's life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try <eos> what's open made to justice that justice seizes : what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves <eos> 'tis very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and take't because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it <eos> you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults but rather tell me when i that censure him do so offend let mine own judgment pattern out my death and nothing come in partial <eos> sir he must die <eos> escalus : be it as your wisdom will <eos> angelo : where is the provost <eos> provost : here if it like your honour <eos> angelo : see that claudio be executed by nine to-morrow morning : bring him his confessor let him be prepared for that's the utmost of his pilgrimage <eos> escalus : elbow : come bring them away : if these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses i know no law : bring them away <eos> angelo : how now sir <eos> what's your name <eos> and what's the matter <eos> elbow : if it please your honour i am the poor duke's constable and my name is elbow : i do lean upon justice sir and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors <eos> angelo : benefactors <eos> well what benefactors are they <eos> are they not malefactors <eos> elbow : if it <eos> please your honour i know not well what they are : but precise villains they are that i am sure of and void of all profanation in the world that good christians ought to have <eos> escalus : this comes off well here's a wise officer <eos> angelo : go to : what quality are they of <eos> elbow is your name <eos> why dost thou not speak elbow <eos> pompey : he cannot sir he's out at elbow <eos> angelo : what are you sir <eos> elbow : he sir <eos> a tapster sir parcel-bawd one that serves a bad woman whose house sir was as they say plucked down in the suburbs and now she professes a hot-house which i think is a very ill house too <eos> escalus : how know you that <eos> elbow : my wife sir whom i detest before heaven and your honour <eos> escalus : how <eos> thy wife <eos> elbow : ay sir whom i thank heaven is an honest woman <eos> escalus : dost thou detest her therefore <eos> elbow : i say sir i will detest myself also as well as she that this house if it be not a bawd's house it is pity of her life for it is a naughty house <eos> escalus : how dost thou know that constable <eos> elbow : marry sir by my wife who if she had been a woman cardinally given might have been accused in fornication adultery and all uncleanliness there <eos> escalus : by the woman's means <eos> elbow : ay sir by mistress overdone's means : but as she spit in his face so she defied him <eos> pompey : sir if it please your honour this is not so <eos> elbow : prove it before these varlets here thou honourable man prove it <eos> escalus : do you hear how he misplaces <eos> pompey : sir she came in great with child and longing saving your honour's reverence for stewed prunes sir we had but two in the house which at that very distant time stood as it were in a fruit-dish a dish of some three-pence your honours have seen such dishes they are not china dishes but very good dishes <eos> escalus : go to go to : no matter for the dish sir <eos> pompey : no indeed sir not of a pin you are therein in the right : but to the point <eos> as i say this mistress elbow being as i say with child and being great-bellied and longing as i said for prunes and having but two in the dish as i said master froth here this very man having eaten the rest as i said and as i say paying for them very honestly for as you know master froth i could not give you three-pence again <eos> froth : no indeed <eos> pompey : very well : you being then if you be remembered cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes <eos> froth : ay so i did indeed <eos> pompey : why very well i telling you then if you be remembered that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of unless they kept very good diet as i told you <eos> froth : all this is true <eos> pompey : why very well then <eos> escalus : come you are a tedious fool : to the purpose <eos> what was done to elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of <eos> come me to what was done to her <eos> pompey : sir your honour cannot come to that yet <eos> escalus : no sir nor i mean it not <eos> pompey : sir but you shall come to it by your honour's leave <eos> and i beseech you look into master froth here sir a man of four-score pound a year whose father died at hallowmas : was't not at hallowmas master froth <eos> froth : all-hallond eve <eos> pompey : why very well i hope here be truths <eos> he sir sitting as i say in a lower chair sir 'twas in the bunch of grapes where indeed you have a delight to sit have you not <eos> froth : i have so because it is an open room and good for winter <eos> pompey : why very well then i hope here be truths <eos> angelo : this will last out a night in russia when nights are longest there : i'll take my leave <eos> and leave you to the hearing of the cause hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all <eos> escalus : i think no less <eos> good morrow to your lordship <eos> now sir come on : what was done to elbow's wife once more <eos> pompey : once sir <eos> there was nothing done to her once <eos> elbow : i beseech you sir ask him what this man did to my wife <eos> pompey : i beseech your honour ask me <eos> escalus : well sir what did this gentleman to her <eos> pompey : i beseech you sir look in this gentleman's face <eos> good master froth look upon his honour 'tis for a good purpose <eos> doth your honour mark his face <eos> escalus : ay sir very well <eos> pompey : nay i beseech you mark it well <eos> escalus : well i do so <eos> pompey : doth your honour see any harm in his face <eos> escalus : why no <eos> pompey : i'll be supposed upon a book his face is the worst thing about him <eos> good then if his face be the worst thing about him how could master froth do the constable's wife any harm <eos> i would know that of your honour <eos> escalus : he's in the right <eos> constable what say you to it <eos> elbow : first an it like you the house is a respected house next this is a respected fellow and his mistress is a respected woman <eos> pompey : by this hand sir his wife is a more respected person than any of us all <eos> elbow : varlet thou liest thou liest wicked varlet <eos> the time has yet to come that she was ever respected with man woman or child <eos> pompey : sir she was respected with him before he married with her <eos> escalus : which is the wiser here <eos> justice or iniquity <eos> is this true <eos> elbow : o thou caitiff <eos> o thou varlet <eos> o thou wicked hannibal <eos> i respected with her before i was married to her <eos> if ever i was respected with her or she with me let not your worship think me the poor duke's officer <eos> prove this thou wicked hannibal or i'll have mine action of battery on thee <eos> escalus : if he took you a box o' the ear you might have your action of slander too <eos> elbow : marry i thank your good worship for it <eos> what is't your worship's pleasure i shall do with this wicked caitiff <eos> escalus : truly officer because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst let him continue in his courses till thou knowest what they are <eos> elbow : marry i thank your worship for it <eos> thou seest thou wicked varlet now what's come upon thee : thou art to continue now thou varlet thou art to continue <eos> escalus : where were you born friend <eos> froth : here in vienna sir <eos> escalus : are you of fourscore pounds a year <eos> froth : yes an't please you sir <eos> escalus : so <eos> what trade are you of sir <eos> pomphey : tapster a poor widow's tapster <eos> escalus : your mistress' name <eos> pomphey : mistress overdone <eos> escalus : hath she had any more than one husband <eos> pompey : nine sir overdone by the last <eos> escalus : nine <eos> come hither to me master froth <eos> master froth i would not have you acquainted with tapsters : they will draw you master froth and you will hang them <eos> get you gone and let me hear no more of you <eos> froth : i thank your worship <eos> for mine own part i never come into any room in a tap-house but i am drawn in <eos> escalus : well no more of it master froth : farewell <eos> come you hither to me master tapster <eos> what's your name master tapster <eos> pompey : pompey <eos> escalus : what else <eos> pompey : bum sir <eos> escalus : troth and your bum is the greatest thing about you so that in the beastliest sense you are pompey the great <eos> pompey you are partly a bawd pompey howsoever you colour it in being a tapster are you not <eos> come tell me true : it shall be the better for you <eos> pompey : truly sir i am a poor fellow that would live <eos> escalus : how would you live pompey <eos> by being a bawd <eos> what do you think of the trade pompey <eos> is it a lawful trade <eos> pompey : if the law would allow it sir <eos> escalus : but the law will not allow it pompey nor it shall not be allowed in vienna <eos> pompey : does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city <eos> escalus : no pompey <eos> pompey : truly sir in my poor opinion they will to't then <eos> if your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves you need not to fear the bawds <eos> escalus : there are pretty orders beginning i can tell you : it is but heading and hanging <eos> pompey : if you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together you'll be glad to give out a commission for more heads : if this law hold in vienna ten year i'll rent the fairest house in it after three-pence a bay : if you live to see this come to pass say pompey told you so <eos> escalus : thank you good pompey and in requital of your prophecy hark you : i advise you let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever no not for dwelling where you do : if i do pompey i shall beat you to your tent and prove a shrewd caesar to you in plain dealing pompey i shall have you whipt : so for this time pompey fare you well <eos> pompey : i thank your worship for your good counsel : but i shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine <eos> whip me <eos> no no let carman whip his jade : the valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade <eos> escalus : come hither to me master elbow come hither master constable <eos> how long have you been in this place of constable <eos> elbow : seven year and a half sir <eos> escalus : i thought by your readiness in the office you had continued in it some time <eos> you say seven years together <eos> elbow : and a half sir <eos> escalus : alas it hath been great pains to you <eos> they do you wrong to put you so oft upon 't : are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it <eos> elbow : faith sir few of any wit in such matters : as they are chosen they are glad to choose me for them i do it for some piece of money and go through with all <eos> escalus : look you bring me in the names of some six or seven the most sufficient of your parish <eos> elbow : to your worship's house sir <eos> escalus : to my house <eos> fare you well <eos> what's o'clock think you <eos> justice : eleven sir <eos> escalus : i pray you home to dinner with me <eos> justice : i humbly thank you <eos> escalus : it grieves me for the death of claudio but there's no remedy <eos> justice : lord angelo is severe <eos> escalus : it is but needful : mercy is not itself that oft looks so pardon is still the nurse of second woe : but yet <eos>poor claudio <eos> there is no remedy <eos> come sir <eos> servant : he's hearing of a cause he will come straight i'll tell him of you <eos> provost : pray you do <eos> i'll know his pleasure may be he will relent <eos> alas he hath but as offended in a dream <eos> all sects all ages smack of this vice and he to die for't <eos> angelo : now what's the matter <eos> provost <eos> provost : is it your will claudio shall die tomorrow <eos> angelo : did not i tell thee yea <eos> hadst thou not order <eos> why dost thou ask again <eos> provost : lest i might be too rash : under your good correction i have seen when after execution judgment hath repented o'er his doom <eos> angelo : go to let that be mine : do you your office or give up your place and you shall well be spared <eos> provost : i crave your honour's pardon <eos> what shall be done sir with the groaning juliet <eos> she's very near her hour <eos> angelo : dispose of her to some more fitter place and that with speed <eos> servant : here is the sister of the man condemn'd desires access to you <eos> angelo : hath he a sister <eos> provost : ay my good lord a very virtuous maid and to be shortly of a sisterhood if not already <eos> angelo : well let her be admitted <eos> see you the fornicatress be removed : let have needful but not lavish means there shall be order for't <eos> provost : god save your honour <eos> angelo : stay a little while <eos> you're welcome : what's your will <eos> isabella : i am a woeful suitor to your honour please but your honour hear me <eos> angelo : well what's your suit <eos> isabella : there is a vice that most i do abhor and most desire should meet the blow of justice for which i would not plead but that i must for which i must not plead but that i am at war 'twixt will and will not <eos> angelo : well the matter <eos> isabella : i have a brother is condemn'd to die : i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother <eos> provost : angelo : condemn the fault and not the actor of it <eos> why every fault's condemn'd ere it be done : mine were the very cipher of a function to fine the faults whose fine stands in record and let go by the actor <eos> isabella : o just but severe law <eos> i had a brother then <eos> heaven keep your honour <eos> lucio : isabella : must he needs die <eos> angelo : maiden no remedy <eos> isabella : yes i do think that you might pardon him and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy <eos> angelo : i will not do't <eos> isabella : but can you if you would <eos> angelo : look what i will not that i cannot do <eos> isabella : but might you do't and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse as mine is to him <eos> angelo : he's sentenced 'tis too late <eos> lucio : isabella : too late <eos> why no i that do speak a word <eos> may call it back again <eos> well believe this no ceremony that to great ones 'longs not the king's crown nor the deputed sword the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does <eos> if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipt like him but he like you would not have been so stern <eos> angelo : pray you be gone <eos> isabella : i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel <eos> should it then be thus <eos> no i would tell what 'twere to be a judge and what a prisoner <eos> lucio : angelo : your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words <eos> isabella : alas alas <eos> why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy <eos> how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are <eos> o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made <eos> angelo : be you content fair maid it is the law not i condemn your brother : were he my kinsman brother or my son it should be thus with him : he must die tomorrow <eos> isabella : to-morrow <eos> o that's sudden <eos> spare him spare him <eos> he's not prepared for death <eos> even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season : shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves <eos> good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offence <eos> there's many have committed it <eos> lucio : angelo : the law hath not been dead though it hath slept : those many had not dared to do that evil if the first that did the edict infringe had answer'd for his deed : now 'tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils either new or by remissness new-conceived and so in progress to be hatch'd and born are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end <eos> isabella : yet show some pity <eos> angelo : i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismiss'd offence would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another <eos> be satisfied your brother dies to-morrow be content <eos> isabella : so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffer's <eos> o it is excellent to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant <eos> lucio : isabella : could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would ne'er be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder <eos> merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle : but man proud man drest in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he's most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal <eos> lucio : provost : isabella : we cannot weigh our brother with ourself : great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation <eos> lucio : thou'rt i' the right girl more o that <eos> isabella : that in the captain's but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy <eos> lucio : angelo : why do you put these sayings upon me <eos> isabella : because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o' the top <eos> go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know that's like my brother's fault : if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brother's life <eos> angelo : isabella : gentle my lord turn back <eos> angelo : i will bethink me : come again tomorrow <eos> isabella : hark how i'll bribe you : good my lord turn back <eos> angelo : how <eos> bribe me <eos> isabella : ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you <eos> lucio : isabella : not with fond shekels of the tested gold or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sun-rise prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal <eos> angelo : well come to me to-morrow <eos> lucio : isabella : heaven keep your honour safe <eos> angelo : isabella : at what hour to-morrow shall i attend your lordship <eos> angelo : at any time 'fore noon <eos> isabella : 'save your honour <eos> angelo : from thee even from thy virtue <eos> what's this what's this <eos> is this her fault or mine <eos> the tempter or the tempted who sins most <eos> ha <eos> not she : nor doth she tempt : but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season <eos> can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than woman's lightness <eos> having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there <eos> o fie fie fie <eos> what dost thou or what art thou angelo <eos> dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good <eos> o let her brother live <eos> thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves <eos> what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes <eos> what is't i dream on <eos> o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook <eos> most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue : never could the strumpet with all her double vigour art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite <eos> even till now when men were fond i smiled and wonder'd how <eos> duke vincentio : hail to you provost <eos> so i think you are <eos> provost : i am the provost <eos> what's your will good friar <eos> duke vincentio : bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison <eos> do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly <eos> provost : i would do more than that if more were needful <eos> look here comes one : a gentlewoman of mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blister'd her report : she is with child and he that got it sentenced a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this <eos> duke vincentio : when must he die <eos> provost : as i do think to-morrow <eos> i have provided for you : stay awhile and you shall be conducted <eos> duke vincentio : repent you fair one of the sin you carry <eos> juliet : i do and bear the shame most patiently <eos> duke vincentio : i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on <eos> juliet : i'll gladly learn <eos> duke vincentio : love you the man that wrong'd you <eos> juliet : yes as i love the woman that wrong'd him <eos> duke vincentio : so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed <eos> juliet : mutually <eos> duke vincentio : then was your sin of heavier kind than his <eos> juliet : i do confess it and repent it father <eos> duke vincentio : 'tis meet so daughter : but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear <eos> juliet : i do repent me as it is an evil and take the shame with joy <eos> duke vincentio : there rest <eos> your partner as i hear must die to-morrow and i am going with instruction to him <eos> grace go with you benedicite <eos> juliet : must die to-morrow <eos> o injurious love that respites me a life whose very comfort is still a dying horror <eos> provost : 'tis pity of him <eos> angelo : when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects <eos> heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel : heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception <eos> the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown fear'd and tedious yea my gravity wherein <eos>let no man hear me <eos>i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain <eos> o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming <eos> blood thou art blood : let's write good angel on the devil's horn : 'tis not the devil's crest <eos> how now <eos> who's there <eos> servant : one isabel a sister desires access to you <eos> angelo : teach her the way <eos> o heavens <eos> why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness <eos> so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive : and even so the general subject to a well-wish'd king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence <eos> how now fair maid <eos> isabella : i am come to know your pleasure <eos> angelo : that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what 'tis <eos> your brother cannot live <eos> isabella : even so <eos> heaven keep your honour <eos> angelo : yet may he live awhile and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die <eos> isabella : under your sentence <eos> angelo : yea <eos> isabella : when i beseech you <eos> that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not <eos> angelo : ha <eos> fie these filthy vices <eos> it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image in stamps that are forbid : 'tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one <eos> isabella : 'tis set down so in heaven but not in earth <eos> angelo : say you so <eos> then i shall pose you quickly <eos> which had you rather that the most just law now took your brother's life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath stain'd <eos> isabella : sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul <eos> angelo : i talk not of your soul : our compell'd sins stand more for number than for accompt <eos> isabella : how say you <eos> angelo : nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say <eos> answer to this : i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother's life : might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother's life <eos> isabella : please you to do't i'll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity <eos> angelo : pleased you to do't at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity <eos> isabella : that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it <eos> you granting of my suit if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer <eos> angelo : nay but hear me <eos> your sense pursues not mine : either you are ignorant or seem so craftily and that's not good <eos> isabella : let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better <eos> angelo : thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could display'd <eos> but mark me to be received plain i'll speak more gross : your brother is to die <eos> isabella : so <eos> angelo : and his offence is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain <eos> isabella : true <eos> angelo : admit no other way to save his life <eos> as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of question <eos>that you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the all-building law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do <eos> isabella : as much for my poor brother as myself : that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips i'ld wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i'ld yield my body up to shame <eos> angelo : then must your brother die <eos> isabella : and 'twere the cheaper way : better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever <eos> angelo : were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander'd so <eos> isabella : ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses : lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption <eos> angelo : you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice <eos> isabella : o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean : i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love <eos> angelo : we are all frail <eos> isabella : else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness <eos> angelo : nay women are frail too <eos> isabella : ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms <eos> women <eos> help heaven <eos> men their creation mar in profiting by them <eos> nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints <eos> angelo : i think it well : and from this testimony of your own sex <eos> since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames <eos>let me be bold i do arrest your words <eos> be that you are that is a woman if you be more you're none if you be one as you are well express'd by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destined livery <eos> isabella : i have no tongue but one : gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language <eos> angelo : plainly conceive i love you <eos> isabella : my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it <eos> angelo : he shall not isabel if you give me love <eos> isabella : i know your virtue hath a licence in't which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others <eos> angelo : believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose <eos> isabella : ha <eos> little honour to be much believed and most pernicious purpose <eos> seeming seeming <eos> i will proclaim thee angelo look for't : sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretch'd throat i'll tell the world aloud what man thou art <eos> angelo : who will believe thee isabel <eos> my unsoil'd name the austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i' the state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny <eos> i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein : fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance <eos> answer me to-morrow or by the affection that now guides me most i'll prove a tyrant to him <eos> as for you say what you can my false o'erweighs your true <eos> isabella : to whom should i complain <eos> did i tell this who would believe me <eos> o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the self-same tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make court'sy to their will : hooking both right and wrong to the appetite to follow as it draws <eos> i'll to my brother : though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour <eos> that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks he'ld yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr'd pollution <eos> then isabel live chaste and brother die : more than our brother is our chastity <eos> i'll tell him yet of angelo's request and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest <eos> duke vincentio : so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo <eos> claudio : the miserable have no other medicine but only hope : i've hope to live and am prepared to die <eos> duke vincentio : be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter <eos> reason thus with life : if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep : a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keep'st hourly afflict : merely thou art death's fool for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun and yet runn'st toward him still <eos> thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou bear'st are nursed by baseness <eos> thou'rt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm <eos> thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more <eos> thou art not thyself for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust <eos> happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forget'st <eos> thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon <eos> if thou art rich thou'rt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee <eos> friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner <eos> thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after-dinner's sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant <eos> what's yet in this that bears the name of life <eos> yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths : yet death we fear that makes these odds all even <eos> claudio : i humbly thank you <eos> to sue to live i find i seek to die and seeking death find life : let it come on <eos> isabella : provost : who's there <eos> come in : the wish deserves a welcome <eos> duke vincentio : dear sir ere long i'll visit you again <eos> claudio : most holy sir i thank you <eos> isabella : my business is a word or two with claudio <eos> provost : and very welcome <eos> look signior here's your sister <eos> duke vincentio : provost a word with you <eos> provost : as many as you please <eos> duke vincentio : bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed <eos> claudio : now sister what's the comfort <eos> isabella : why as all comforts are most good most good indeed <eos> lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger : therefore your best appointment make with speed to-morrow you set on <eos> claudio : is there no remedy <eos> isabella : none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain <eos> claudio : but is there any <eos> isabella : yes brother you may live : there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you'll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death <eos> claudio : perpetual durance <eos> isabella : ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world's vastidity you had to a determined scope <eos> claudio : but in what nature <eos> isabella : in such a one as you consenting to't would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked <eos> claudio : let me know the point <eos> isabella : o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour <eos> darest thou die <eos> the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies <eos> claudio : why give you me this shame <eos> think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness <eos> if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms <eos> isabella : there spake my brother there my father's grave did utter forth a voice <eos> yes thou must die : thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances <eos> this outward-sainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell <eos> claudio : the prenzie angelo <eos> isabella : o 'tis the cunning livery of hell the damned'st body to invest and cover in prenzie guards <eos> dost thou think claudio <eos> if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed <eos> claudio : o heavens <eos> it cannot be <eos> isabella : yes he would give't thee from this rank offence so to offend him still <eos> this night's the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest to-morrow <eos> claudio : thou shalt not do't <eos> isabella : o were it but my life i'ld throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin <eos> claudio : thanks dear isabel <eos> isabella : be ready claudio for your death tomorrow <eos> claudio : yes <eos> has he affections in him that thus can make him bite the law by the nose when he would force it <eos> sure it is no sin or of the deadly seven it is the least <eos> isabella : which is the least <eos> claudio : if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined <eos> o isabel <eos> isabella : what says my brother <eos> claudio : death is a fearful thing <eos> isabella : and shamed life a hateful <eos> claudio : ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice to be imprison'd in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling : 'tis too horrible <eos> the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death <eos> isabella : alas alas <eos> claudio : sweet sister let me live : what sin you do to save a brother's life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue <eos> isabella : o you beast <eos> o faithless coward <eos> o dishonest wretch <eos> wilt thou be made a man out of my vice <eos> is't not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister's shame <eos> what should i think <eos> heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair <eos> for such a warped slip of wilderness ne'er issued from his blood <eos> take my defiance <eos> die perish <eos> might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed : i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee <eos> claudio : nay hear me isabel <eos> isabella : o fie fie fie <eos> thy sin's not accidental but a trade <eos> mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd : 'tis best thou diest quickly <eos> claudio : o hear me isabella <eos> duke vincentio : vouchsafe a word young sister but one word <eos> isabella : what is your will <eos> duke vincentio : might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you : the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit <eos> isabella : i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile <eos> duke vincentio : son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister <eos> angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures : she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive <eos> i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death : do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible : tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready <eos> claudio : let me ask my sister pardon <eos> i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it <eos> duke vincentio : hold you there : farewell <eos> provost a word with you <eos> provost : what's your will father duke vincentio : that now you are come you will be gone <eos> leave me awhile with the maid : my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company <eos> provost : in good time <eos> duke vincentio : the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good : the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair <eos> the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo <eos> how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother <eos> isabella : i am now going to resolve him : i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born <eos> but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo <eos> if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government <eos> duke vincentio : that shall not be much amiss : yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only <eos> therefore fasten your ear on my advisings : to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself <eos> i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business <eos> isabella : let me hear you speak farther <eos> i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit <eos> duke vincentio : virtue is bold and goodness never fearful <eos> have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea <eos> isabella : i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name <eos> duke vincentio : she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed : between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister <eos> but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman : there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage-dowry with both her combinate husband this well-seeming angelo <eos> isabella : can this be so <eos> did angelo so leave her <eos> duke vincentio : left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour : in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not <eos> isabella : what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world <eos> what corruption in this life that it will let this man live <eos> but how out of this can she avail <eos> duke vincentio : it is a rupture that you may easily heal : and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it <eos> isabella : show me how good father <eos> duke vincentio : this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection : his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly <eos> go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience <eos> this being granted in course <eos>and now follows all <eos>we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense : and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled <eos> the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt <eos> if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof <eos> what think you of it <eos> isabella : the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection <eos> duke vincentio : it lies much in your holding up <eos> haste you speedily to angelo : if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction <eos> i will presently to saint luke's : there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana <eos> at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly <eos> isabella : i thank you for this comfort <eos> fare you well good father <eos> elbow : nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard <eos> duke vincentio : o heavens <eos> what stuff is here pompey : 'twas never merry world since of two usuries the merriest was put down and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm and furred with fox and lamb-skins too to signify that craft being richer than innocency stands for the facing <eos> elbow : come your way sir <eos> 'bless you good father friar <eos> duke vincentio : and you good brother father <eos> what offence hath this man made you sir <eos> elbow : marry sir he hath offended the law : and sir we take him to be a thief too sir for we have found upon him sir a strange picklock which we have sent to the deputy <eos> duke vincentio : fie sirrah <eos> a bawd a wicked bawd <eos> the evil that thou causest to be done that is thy means to live <eos> do thou but think what 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice : say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live <eos> canst thou believe thy living is a life so stinkingly depending <eos> go mend go mend <eos> pompey : indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet sir i would prove <eos> duke vincentio : nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin thou wilt prove his <eos> take him to prison officer : correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit <eos> elbow : he must before the deputy sir he has given him warning : the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster : if he be a whoremonger and comes before him he were as good go a mile on his errand <eos> duke vincentio : that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as faults from seeming free <eos> elbow : his neck will come to your waist <eos>a cord sir <eos> pompey : i spy comfort i cry bail <eos> here's a gentleman and a friend of mine <eos> lucio : how now noble pompey <eos> what at the wheels of caesar <eos> art thou led in triumph <eos> what is there none of pygmalion's images newly made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd <eos> what reply ha <eos> what sayest thou to this tune matter and method <eos> is't not drowned i' the last rain ha <eos> what sayest thou trot <eos> is the world as it was man <eos> which is the way <eos> is it sad and few words <eos> or how <eos> the trick of it <eos> duke vincentio : still thus and thus still worse <eos> lucio : how doth my dear morsel thy mistress <eos> procures she still ha <eos> pompey : troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she is herself in the tub <eos> lucio : why 'tis good it is the right of it it must be so : ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd : an unshunned consequence it must be so <eos> art going to prison pompey <eos> pompey : yes faith sir <eos> lucio : why 'tis not amiss pompey <eos> farewell : go say i sent thee thither <eos> for debt pompey <eos> or how <eos> elbow : for being a bawd for being a bawd <eos> lucio : well then imprison him : if imprisonment be the due of a bawd why 'tis his right : bawd is he doubtless and of antiquity too bawd-born <eos> farewell good pompey <eos> commend me to the prison pompey : you will turn good husband now pompey you will keep the house <eos> pompey : i hope sir your good worship will be my bail <eos> lucio : no indeed will i not pompey it is not the wear <eos> i will pray pompey to increase your bondage : if you take it not patiently why your mettle is the more <eos> adieu trusty pompey <eos> 'bless you friar <eos> duke vincentio : and you <eos> lucio : does bridget paint still pompey ha <eos> elbow : come your ways sir come <eos> pompey : you will not bail me then sir <eos> lucio : then pompey nor now <eos> what news abroad friar <eos> what news <eos> elbow : come your ways sir come <eos> lucio : go to kennel pompey go <eos> what news friar of the duke <eos> duke vincentio : i know none <eos> can you tell me of any <eos> lucio : some say he is with the emperor of russia other some he is in rome : but where is he think you <eos> duke vincentio : i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well <eos> lucio : it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to <eos> lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to 't <eos> duke vincentio : he does well in 't <eos> lucio : a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him : something too crabbed that way friar <eos> duke vincentio : it is too general a vice and severity must cure it <eos> lucio : yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied : but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down <eos> they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation : is it true think you <eos> duke vincentio : how should he be made then <eos> lucio : some report a sea-maid spawned him some that he was begot between two stock-fishes <eos> but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that i know to be true : and he is a motion generative that's infallible <eos> duke vincentio : you are pleasant sir and speak apace <eos> lucio : why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man <eos> would the duke that is absent have done this <eos> ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand : he had some feeling of the sport : he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy <eos> duke vincentio : i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way <eos> lucio : o sir you are deceived <eos> duke vincentio : 'tis not possible <eos> lucio : who not the duke <eos> yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish : the duke had crotchets in him <eos> he would be drunk too that let me inform you <eos> duke vincentio : you do him wrong surely <eos> lucio : sir i was an inward of his <eos> a shy fellow was the duke : and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing <eos> duke vincentio : what i prithee might be the cause <eos> lucio : no pardon 'tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips : but this i can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise <eos> duke vincentio : wise <eos> why no question but he was <eos> lucio : a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow <eos> duke vincentio : either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking : the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation <eos> let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier <eos> therefore you speak unskilfully : or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice <eos> lucio : sir i know him and i love him <eos> duke vincentio : love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love <eos> lucio : come sir i know what i know <eos> duke vincentio : i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak <eos> but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him <eos> if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it : i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name <eos> lucio : sir my name is lucio well known to the duke <eos> duke vincentio : he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you <eos> lucio : i fear you not <eos> duke vincentio : o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite <eos> but indeed i can do you little harm you'll forswear this again <eos> lucio : i'll be hanged first : thou art deceived in me friar <eos> but no more of this <eos> canst thou tell if claudio die to-morrow or no <eos> duke vincentio : why should he die sir <eos> lucio : why <eos> for filling a bottle with a tundish <eos> i would the duke we talk of were returned again : the ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because they are lecherous <eos> the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light : would he were returned <eos> marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing <eos> farewell good friar : i prithee pray for me <eos> the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays <eos> he's not past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic : say that i said so <eos> farewell <eos> duke vincentio : no might nor greatness in mortality can censure 'scape back-wounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes <eos> what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue <eos> but who comes here <eos> escalus : go away with her to prison <eos> mistress overdone : good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lord <eos> escalus : double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind <eos> this would make mercy swear and play the tyrant <eos> provost : a bawd of eleven years' continuance may it please your honour <eos> mistress overdone : my lord this is one lucio's information against me <eos> mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the duke's time he promised her marriage : his child is a year and a quarter old come philip and jacob : i have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me <eos> escalus : that fellow is a fellow of much licence : let him be called before us <eos> away with her to prison <eos> go to no more words <eos> provost my brother angelo will not be altered claudio must die to-morrow : let him be furnished with divines and have all charitable preparation <eos> if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with him <eos> provost : so please you this friar hath been with him and advised him for the entertainment of death <eos> escalus : good even good father <eos> duke vincentio : bliss and goodness on you <eos> escalus : of whence are you <eos> duke vincentio : not of this country though my chance is now to use it for my time : i am a brother of gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness <eos> escalus : what news abroad i' the world <eos> duke vincentio : none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it : novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking <eos> there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst : much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world <eos> this news is old enough yet it is every day's news <eos> i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke <eos> escalus : one that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself <eos> duke vincentio : what pleasure was he given to <eos> escalus : rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice : a gentleman of all temperance <eos> but leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared <eos> i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation <eos> duke vincentio : he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice : yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die <eos> escalus : you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling <eos> i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty : but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed justice <eos> duke vincentio : if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself <eos> escalus : i am going to visit the prisoner <eos> fare you well <eos> duke vincentio : peace be with you <eos> he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by self-offences weighing <eos> shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking <eos> twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow <eos> o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side <eos> how may likeness made in crimes making practise on the times to draw with idle spiders' strings most ponderous and substantial things <eos> craft against vice i must apply : with angelo to-night shall lie his old betrothed but despised so disguise shall by the disguised pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting <eos> mariana : break off thy song and haste thee quick away : here comes a man of comfort whose advice hath often still'd my brawling discontent <eos> i cry you mercy sir and well could wish you had not found me here so musical : let me excuse me and believe me so my mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe <eos> duke vincentio : 'tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm <eos> i pray you tell me hath any body inquired for me here to-day <eos> much upon this time have i promised here to meet <eos> mariana : you have not been inquired after : i have sat here all day <eos> duke vincentio : i do constantly believe you <eos> the time is come even now <eos> i shall crave your forbearance a little : may be i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself <eos> mariana : i am always bound to you <eos> duke vincentio : very well met and well come <eos> what is the news from this good deputy <eos> isabella : he hath a garden circummured with brick whose western side is with a vineyard back'd and to that vineyard is a planched gate that makes his opening with this bigger key : this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads there have i made my promise upon the heavy middle of the night to call upon him <eos> duke vincentio : but shall you on your knowledge find this way <eos> isabella : i have ta'en a due and wary note upon't : with whispering and most guilty diligence in action all of precept he did show me the way twice o'er <eos> duke vincentio : are there no other tokens between you 'greed concerning her observance <eos> isabella : no none but only a repair i' the dark and that i have possess'd him my most stay can be but brief for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along that stays upon me whose persuasion is i come about my brother <eos> duke vincentio : 'tis well borne up <eos> i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this <eos> what ho <eos> within <eos> come forth <eos> i pray you be acquainted with this maid she comes to do you good <eos> isabella : i do desire the like <eos> duke vincentio : do you persuade yourself that i respect you <eos> mariana : good friar i know you do and have found it <eos> duke vincentio : take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear <eos> i shall attend your leisure : but make haste the vaporous night approaches <eos> mariana : will't please you walk aside <eos> duke vincentio : o place and greatness <eos> millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee : volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quests upon thy doings : thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dreams and rack thee in their fancies <eos> welcome how agreed <eos> isabella : she'll take the enterprise upon her father if you advise it <eos> duke vincentio : it is not my consent but my entreaty too <eos> isabella : little have you to say when you depart from him but soft and low 'remember now my brother <eos>' mariana : fear me not <eos> duke vincentio : nor gentle daughter fear you not at all <eos> he is your husband on a pre-contract : to bring you thus together 'tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit <eos> come let us go : our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow <eos> provost : come hither sirrah <eos> can you cut off a man's head <eos> pompey : if the man be a bachelor sir i can but if he be a married man he's his wife's head and i can never cut off a woman's head <eos> provost : come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer <eos> to-morrow morning are to die claudio and barnardine <eos> here is in our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper : if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been a notorious bawd <eos> pompey : sir i have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind but yet i will be content to be a lawful hangman <eos> i would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow partner <eos> provost : what ho <eos> abhorson <eos> where's abhorson there <eos> abhorson : do you call sir <eos> provost : sirrah here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your execution <eos> if you think it meet compound with him by the year and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present and dismiss him <eos> he cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd <eos> abhorson : a bawd sir <eos> fie upon him <eos> he will discredit our mystery <eos> provost : go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale <eos> pompey : pray sir by your good favour <eos>for surely sir a good favour you have but that you have a hanging look <eos>do you call sir your occupation a mystery <eos> abhorson : ay sir a mystery pompey : painting sir i have heard say is a mystery and your whores sir being members of my occupation using painting do prove my occupation a mystery : but what mystery there should be in hanging if i should be hanged i cannot imagine <eos> abhorson : sir it is a mystery <eos> pompey : proof <eos> abhorson : every true man's apparel fits your thief : if it be too little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough : so every true man's apparel fits your thief <eos> provost : are you agreed <eos> pompey : sir i will serve him for i do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth oftener ask forgiveness <eos> provost : you sirrah provide your block and your axe to-morrow four o'clock <eos> abhorson : come on bawd i will instruct thee in my trade follow <eos> pompey : i do desire to learn sir : and i hope if you have occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly sir for your kindness i owe you a good turn <eos> provost : call hither barnardine and claudio : the one has my pity not a jot the other being a murderer though he were my brother <eos> look here's the warrant claudio for thy death : 'tis now dead midnight and by eight to-morrow thou must be made immortal <eos> where's barnardine <eos> claudio : as fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour when it lies starkly in the traveller's bones : he will not wake <eos> provost : who can do good on him <eos> well go prepare yourself <eos> but hark what noise <eos> heaven give your spirits comfort <eos> by and by <eos> i hope it is some pardon or reprieve for the most gentle claudio <eos> welcome father <eos> duke vincentio : the best and wholesomest spirts of the night envelope you good provost <eos> who call'd here of late <eos> provost : none since the curfew rung <eos> duke vincentio : not isabel <eos> provost : no <eos> duke vincentio : they will then ere't be long <eos> provost : what comfort is for claudio <eos> duke vincentio : there's some in hope <eos> provost : it is a bitter deputy <eos> duke vincentio : not so not so his life is parallel'd even with the stroke and line of his great justice : he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others : were he meal'd with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so he's just <eos> now are they come <eos> this is a gentle provost : seldom when the steeled gaoler is the friend of men <eos> how now <eos> what noise <eos> that spirit's possessed with haste that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes <eos> provost : there he must stay until the officer arise to let him in : he is call'd up <eos> duke vincentio : have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die to-morrow <eos> provost : none sir none <eos> duke vincentio : as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning <eos> provost : happily you something know yet i believe there comes no countermand no such example have we : besides upon the very siege of justice lord angelo hath to the public ear profess'd the contrary <eos> this is his lordship's man <eos> duke vincentio : and here comes claudio's pardon <eos> messenger : provost : i shall obey him <eos> duke vincentio : provost : i told you <eos> lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting-on methinks strangely for he hath not used it before <eos> duke vincentio : pray you let's hear <eos> provost : duke vincentio : what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon <eos> provost : a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old <eos> duke vincentio : how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him <eos> i have heard it was ever his manner to do so <eos> provost : his friends still wrought reprieves for him : and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof <eos> duke vincentio : it is now apparent <eos> provost : most manifest and not denied by himself <eos> duke vincentio : hath he born himself penitently in prison <eos> how seems he to be touched <eos> provost : a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal <eos> duke vincentio : he wants advice <eos> provost : he will hear none : he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not : drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk <eos> we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it : it hath not moved him at all <eos> duke vincentio : more of him anon <eos> there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy : if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard <eos> claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him <eos> to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy <eos> provost : pray sir in what <eos> duke vincentio : in the delaying death <eos> provost : a lack how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo <eos> i may make my case as claudio's to cross this in the smallest <eos> duke vincentio : by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide <eos> let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head born to angelo <eos> provost : angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour <eos> duke vincentio : o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it <eos> shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death : you know the course is common <eos> if any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life <eos> provost : pardon me good father it is against my oath <eos> duke vincentio : were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy <eos> provost : to him and to his substitutes <eos> duke vincentio : you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing <eos> provost : but what likelihood is in that <eos> duke vincentio : not a resemblance but a certainty <eos> yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you <eos> look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke : you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you <eos> provost : i know them both <eos> duke vincentio : the contents of this is the return of the duke : you shall anon over-read it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here <eos> this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the duke's death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ <eos> look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd <eos> put not yourself into amazement how these things should be : all difficulties are but easy when they are known <eos> call your executioner and off with barnardine's head : i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place <eos> yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you <eos> come away it is almost clear dawn <eos> pompey : i am as well acquainted here as i was in our house of profession : one would think it were mistress overdone's own house for here be many of her old customers <eos> first here's young master rash he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger ninescore and seventeen pounds of which he made five marks ready money : marry then ginger was not much in request for the old women were all dead <eos> then is there here one master caper at the suit of master three-pile the mercer for some four suits of peach-coloured satin which now peaches him a beggar <eos> then have we here young dizy and young master deep-vow and master copperspur and master starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man and young drop-heir that killed lusty pudding and master forthlight the tilter and brave master shooty the great traveller and wild half-can that stabbed pots and i think forty more all great doers in our trade and are now 'for the lord's sake <eos>' abhorson : sirrah bring barnardine hither <eos> pompey : master barnardine <eos> you must rise and be hanged <eos> master barnardine <eos> abhorson : what ho barnardine <eos> barnardine : pompey : your friends sir the hangman <eos> you must be so good sir to rise and be put to death <eos> barnardine : abhorson : tell him he must awake and that quickly too <eos> pompey : pray master barnardine awake till you are executed and sleep afterwards <eos> abhorson : go in to him and fetch him out <eos> pompey : he is coming sir he is coming i hear his straw rustle <eos> abhorson : is the axe upon the block sirrah <eos> pompey : very ready sir <eos> barnardine : how now abhorson <eos> what's the news with you <eos> abhorson : truly sir i would desire you to clap into your prayers for look you the warrant's come <eos> barnardine : you rogue i have been drinking all night i am not fitted for 't <eos> pompey : o the better sir for he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day <eos> abhorson : look you sir here comes your ghostly father : do we jest now think you <eos> duke vincentio : sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart i am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you <eos> barnardine : friar not i i have been drinking hard all night and i will have more time to prepare me or they shall beat out my brains with billets : i will not consent to die this day that's certain <eos> duke vincentio : o sir you must : and therefore i beseech you look forward on the journey you shall go <eos> barnardine : i swear i will not die to-day for any man's persuasion <eos> duke vincentio : but hear you <eos> barnardine : not a word : if you have any thing to say to me come to my ward for thence will not i to-day <eos> duke vincentio : unfit to live or die : o gravel heart <eos> after him fellows bring him to the block <eos> provost : now sir how do you find the prisoner <eos> duke vincentio : a creature unprepared unmeet for death and to transport him in the mind he is were damnable <eos> provost : here in the prison father there died this morning of a cruel fever one ragozine a most notorious pirate a man of claudio's years his beard and head just of his colour <eos> what if we do omit this reprobate till he were well inclined and satisfy the deputy with the visage of ragozine more like to claudio <eos> duke vincentio : o 'tis an accident that heaven provides <eos> dispatch it presently the hour draws on prefix'd by angelo : see this be done and sent according to command whiles i persuade this rude wretch willingly to die <eos> provost : this shall be done good father presently <eos> but barnardine must die this afternoon : and how shall we continue claudio to save me from the danger that might come if he were known alive <eos> duke vincentio : let this be done <eos> put them in secret holds both barnardine and claudio : ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting to the under generation you shall find your safety manifested <eos> provost : i am your free dependant <eos> duke vincentio : quick dispatch and send the head to angelo <eos> now will i write letters to angelo <eos> the provost he shall bear them whose contents shall witness to him i am near at home and that by great injunctions i am bound to enter publicly : him i'll desire to meet me at the consecrated fount a league below the city and from thence by cold gradation and well-balanced form we shall proceed with angelo <eos> provost : here is the head i'll carry it myself <eos> duke vincentio : convenient is it <eos> make a swift return for i would commune with you of such things that want no ear but yours <eos> provost : i'll make all speed <eos> isabella : duke vincentio : the tongue of isabel <eos> she's come to know if yet her brother's pardon be come hither : but i will keep her ignorant of her good to make her heavenly comforts of despair when it is least expected <eos> isabella : ho by your leave <eos> duke vincentio : good morning to you fair and gracious daughter <eos> isabella : the better given me by so holy a man <eos> hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon <eos> duke vincentio : he hath released him isabel from the world : his head is off and sent to angelo <eos> isabella : nay but it is not so <eos> duke vincentio : it is no other : show your wisdom daughter in your close patience <eos> isabella : o i will to him and pluck out his eyes <eos> duke vincentio : you shall not be admitted to his sight <eos> isabella : unhappy claudio <eos> wretched isabel <eos> injurious world <eos> most damned angelo <eos> duke vincentio : this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven <eos> mark what i say which you shall find by every syllable a faithful verity : the duke comes home to-morrow nay dry your eyes one of our convent and his confessor gives me this instance : already he hath carried notice to escalus and angelo who do prepare to meet him at the gates there to give up their power <eos> if you can pace your wisdom in that good path that i would wish it go and you shall have your bosom on this wretch grace of the duke revenges to your heart and general honour <eos> isabella : i am directed by you <eos> duke vincentio : this letter then to friar peter give 'tis that he sent me of the duke's return : say by this token i desire his company at mariana's house to-night <eos> her cause and yours i'll perfect him withal and he shall bring you before the duke and to the head of angelo accuse him home and home <eos> for my poor self i am combined by a sacred vow and shall be absent <eos> wend you with this letter : command these fretting waters from your eyes with a light heart trust not my holy order if i pervert your course <eos> who's here <eos> lucio : good even <eos> friar where's the provost <eos> duke vincentio : not within sir <eos> lucio : o pretty isabella i am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red : thou must be patient <eos> i am fain to dine and sup with water and bran i dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to 't <eos> but they say the duke will be here to-morrow <eos> by my troth isabel i loved thy brother : if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived <eos> duke vincentio : sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in them <eos> lucio : friar thou knowest not the duke so well as i do : he's a better woodman than thou takest him for <eos> duke vincentio : well you'll answer this one day <eos> fare ye well <eos> lucio : nay tarry i'll go along with thee i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke <eos> duke vincentio : you have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enough <eos> lucio : i was once before him for getting a wench with child <eos> duke vincentio : did you such a thing <eos> lucio : yes marry did i but i was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar <eos> duke vincentio : sir your company is fairer than honest <eos> rest you well <eos> lucio : by my troth i'll go with thee to the lane's end : if bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of it <eos> nay friar i am a kind of burr i shall stick <eos> escalus : every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other <eos> angelo : in most uneven and distracted manner <eos> his actions show much like to madness : pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted <eos> and why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there escalus : i guess not <eos> angelo : and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street <eos> escalus : he shows his reason for that : to have a dispatch of complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against us <eos> angelo : well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes i' the morn i'll call you at your house : give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him <eos> escalus : i shall sir <eos> fare you well <eos> angelo : good night <eos> this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings <eos> a deflower'd maid <eos> and by an eminent body that enforced the law against it <eos> but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me <eos> yet reason dares her no for my authority bears of a credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather <eos> he should have lived save that riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have ta'en revenge by so receiving a dishonour'd life with ransom of such shame <eos> would yet he had lived <eos> a lack when once our grace we have forgot nothing goes right : we would and we would not <eos> duke vincentio : these letters at fit time deliver me the provost knows our purpose and our plot <eos> the matter being afoot keep your instruction and hold you ever to our special drift though sometimes you do blench from this to that as cause doth minister <eos> go call at flavius' house and tell him where i stay : give the like notice to valentinus rowland and to crassus and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate but send me flavius first <eos> friar peter : it shall be speeded well <eos> duke vincentio : i thank thee varrius thou hast made good haste : come we will walk <eos> there's other of our friends will greet us here anon my gentle varrius <eos> isabella : to speak so indirectly i am loath : i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part : yet i am advised to do it he says to veil full purpose <eos> mariana : be ruled by him <eos> isabella : besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for 'tis a physic that's bitter to sweet end <eos> mariana : i would friar peter <eos> isabella : o peace <eos> the friar is come <eos> friar peter : come i have found you out a stand most fit where you may have such vantage on the duke he shall not pass you <eos> twice have the trumpets sounded the generous and gravest citizens have hent the gates and very near upon the duke is entering : therefore hence away <eos> duke vincentio : my very worthy cousin fairly met <eos> our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you <eos> angelo : happy return be to your royal grace <eos> duke vincentio : many and hearty thankings to you both <eos> we have made inquiry of you and we hear such goodness of your justice that our soul cannot but yield you forth to public thanks forerunning more requital <eos> angelo : you make my bonds still greater <eos> duke vincentio : o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it to lock it in the wards of covert bosom when it deserves with characters of brass a forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time and razure of oblivion <eos> give me your hand and let the subject see to make them know that outward courtesies would fain proclaim favours that keep within <eos> come escalus you must walk by us on our other hand and good supporters are you <eos> friar peter : now is your time : speak loud and kneel before him <eos> isabella : justice o royal duke <eos> vail your regard upon a wrong'd i would fain have said a maid <eos> o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice <eos> duke vincentio : relate your wrongs in what <eos> by whom <eos> be brief <eos> here is lord angelo shall give you justice : reveal yourself to him <eos> isabella : o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil : hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you <eos> hear me o hear me here <eos> angelo : my lord her wits i fear me are not firm : she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice <eos> isabella : by course of justice <eos> angelo : and she will speak most bitterly and strange <eos> isabella : most strange but yet most truly will i speak : that angelo's forsworn is it not strange <eos> that angelo's a murderer is 't not strange <eos> that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin-violator is it not strange and strange <eos> duke vincentio : nay it is ten times strange <eos> isabella : it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange : nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to the end of reckoning <eos> duke vincentio : away with her <eos> poor soul she speaks this in the infirmity of sense <eos> isabella : o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touch'd with madness <eos> make not impossible that which but seems unlike : 'tis not impossible but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an arch-villain believe it royal prince : if he be less he's nothing but he's more had i more name for badness <eos> duke vincentio : by mine honesty if she be mad <eos>as i believe no other <eos> her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as e'er i heard in madness <eos> isabella : o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true <eos> duke vincentio : many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason <eos> what would you say <eos> isabella : i am the sister of one claudio condemn'd upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemn'd by angelo : i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger <eos> lucio : that's i an't like your grace : i came to her from claudio and desired her to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo for her poor brother's pardon <eos> isabella : that's he indeed <eos> duke vincentio : you were not bid to speak <eos> lucio : no my good lord nor wish'd to hold my peace <eos> duke vincentio : i wish you now then pray you take note of it : and when you have a business for yourself pray heaven you then be perfect <eos> lucio : i warrant your honour <eos> duke vincentio : the warrants for yourself take heed to't <eos> isabella : this gentleman told somewhat of my tale <eos> lucio : right <eos> duke vincentio : it may be right but you are i' the wrong to speak before your time <eos> proceed <eos> isabella : i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy <eos> duke vincentio : that's somewhat madly spoken <eos> isabella : pardon it the phrase is to the matter <eos> duke vincentio : mended again <eos> the matter proceed <eos> isabella : in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i pray'd and kneel'd how he refell'd me and how i replied <eos> for this was of much length <eos>the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter : he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him : but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother's head <eos> duke vincentio : this is most likely <eos> isabella : o that it were as like as it is true <eos> duke vincentio : by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speak'st or else thou art suborn'd against his honour in hateful practise <eos> first his integrity stands without blemish <eos> next it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults proper to himself : if he had so offended he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself and not have cut him off <eos> some one hath set you on : confess the truth and say by whose advice thou camest here to complain <eos> isabella : and is this all <eos> then o you blessed ministers above keep me in patience and with ripen'd time unfold the evil which is here wrapt up in countenance <eos> heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go <eos> duke vincentio : i know you'ld fain be gone <eos> an officer <eos> to prison with her <eos> shall we thus permit a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall on him so near us <eos> this needs must be a practise <eos> who knew of your intent and coming hither <eos> isabella : one that i would were here friar lodowick <eos> duke vincentio : a ghostly father belike <eos> who knows that lodowick <eos> lucio : my lord i know him 'tis a meddling friar i do not like the man : had he been lay my lord for certain words he spake against your grace in your retirement i had swinged him soundly <eos> duke vincentio : words against me <eos> this is a good friar belike <eos> and to set on this wretched woman here against our substitute <eos> let this friar be found <eos> lucio : but yesternight my lord she and that friar i saw them at the prison : a saucy friar a very scurvy fellow <eos> friar peter : blessed be your royal grace <eos> i have stood by my lord and i have heard your royal ear abused <eos> first hath this woman most wrongfully accused your substitute who is as free from touch or soil with her as she from one ungot <eos> duke vincentio : we did believe no less <eos> know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of <eos> friar peter : i know him for a man divine and holy not scurvy nor a temporary meddler as he's reported by this gentleman and on my trust a man that never yet did as he vouches misreport your grace <eos> lucio : my lord most villanously believe it <eos> friar peter : well he in time may come to clear himself but at this instant he is sick my lord of a strange fever <eos> upon his mere request being come to knowledge that there was complaint intended 'gainst lord angelo came i hither to speak as from his mouth what he doth know is true and false and what he with his oath and all probation will make up full clear whensoever he's convented <eos> first for this woman <eos> to justify this worthy nobleman so vulgarly and personally accused her shall you hear disproved to her eyes till she herself confess it <eos> duke vincentio : good friar let's hear it <eos> do you not smile at this lord angelo <eos> o heaven the vanity of wretched fools <eos> give us some seats <eos> come cousin angelo in this i'll be impartial be you judge of your own cause <eos> is this the witness friar <eos> first let her show her face and after speak <eos> mariana : pardon my lord i will not show my face until my husband bid me <eos> duke vincentio : what are you married <eos> mariana : no my lord <eos> duke vincentio : are you a maid <eos> mariana : no my lord <eos> duke vincentio : a widow then <eos> mariana : neither my lord <eos> duke vincentio : why you are nothing then : neither maid widow nor wife <eos> lucio : my lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid widow nor wife <eos> duke vincentio : silence that fellow : i would he had some cause to prattle for himself <eos> lucio : well my lord <eos> mariana : my lord i do confess i ne'er was married and i confess besides i am no maid : i have known my husband yet my husband knows not that ever he knew me <eos> lucio : he was drunk then my lord : it can be no better <eos> duke vincentio : for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too <eos> lucio : well my lord <eos> duke vincentio : this is no witness for lord angelo <eos> mariana : now i come to't my lord she that accuses him of fornication in self-same manner doth accuse my husband and charges him my lord with such a time when i'll depose i had him in mine arms with all the effect of love <eos> angelo : charges she more than me <eos> mariana : not that i know <eos> duke vincentio : no <eos> you say your husband <eos> mariana : why just my lord and that is angelo who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body but knows he thinks that he knows isabel's <eos> angelo : this is a strange abuse <eos> let's see thy face <eos> mariana : my husband bids me now i will unmask <eos> this is that face thou cruel angelo which once thou sworest was worth the looking on this is the hand which with a vow'd contract was fast belock'd in thine this is the body that took away the match from isabel and did supply thee at thy garden-house in her imagined person <eos> duke vincentio : know you this woman <eos> lucio : carnally she says <eos> duke vincentio : sirrah no more <eos> lucio : enough my lord <eos> angelo : my lord i must confess i know this woman : and five years since there was some speech of marriage betwixt myself and her which was broke off partly for that her promised proportions came short of composition but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity : since which time of five years i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her upon my faith and honour <eos> mariana : noble prince as there comes light from heaven and words from breath as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue i am affianced this man's wife as strongly as words could make up vows : and my good lord but tuesday night last gone in's garden-house he knew me as a wife <eos> as this is true let me in safety raise me from my knees or else for ever be confixed here a marble monument <eos> angelo : i did but smile till now : now good my lord give me the scope of justice my patience here is touch'd <eos> i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on : let me have way my lord to find this practise out <eos> duke vincentio : ay with my heart and punish them to your height of pleasure <eos> thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman compact with her that's gone think'st thou thy oaths though they would swear down each particular saint were testimonies against his worth and credit that's seal'd in approbation <eos> you lord escalus sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains to find out this abuse whence 'tis derived <eos> there is another friar that set them on let him be sent for <eos> friar peter : would he were here my lord <eos> for he indeed hath set the women on to this complaint : your provost knows the place where he abides and he may fetch him <eos> duke vincentio : go do it instantly <eos> and you my noble and well-warranted cousin whom it concerns to hear this matter forth do with your injuries as seems you best in any chastisement : i for a while will leave you but stir not you till you have well determined upon these slanderers <eos> escalus : my lord we'll do it throughly <eos> signior lucio did not you say you knew that friar lodowick to be a dishonest person <eos> lucio : 'cucullus non facit monachum :' honest in nothing but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most villanous speeches of the duke <eos> escalus : we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him : we shall find this friar a notable fellow <eos> lucio : as any in vienna on my word <eos> escalus : call that same isabel here once again i would speak with her <eos> pray you my lord give me leave to question you shall see how i'll handle her <eos> lucio : not better than he by her own report <eos> escalus : say you <eos> lucio : marry sir i think if you handled her privately she would sooner confess : perchance publicly she'll be ashamed <eos> escalus : i will go darkly to work with her <eos> lucio : that's the way for women are light at midnight <eos> escalus : come on mistress : here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said <eos> lucio : my lord here comes the rascal i spoke of here with the provost <eos> escalus : in very good time : speak not you to him till we call upon you <eos> lucio : mum <eos> escalus : come sir : did you set these women on to slander lord angelo <eos> they have confessed you did <eos> duke vincentio : 'tis false <eos> escalus : how <eos> know you where you are <eos> duke vincentio : respect to your great place <eos> and let the devil be sometime honour'd for his burning throne <eos> where is the duke <eos> 'tis he should hear me speak <eos> escalus : the duke's in us and we will hear you speak : look you speak justly <eos> duke vincentio : boldly at least <eos> but o poor souls come you to seek the lamb here of the fox <eos> good night to your redress <eos> is the duke gone <eos> then is your cause gone too <eos> the duke's unjust thus to retort your manifest appeal and put your trial in the villain's mouth which here you come to accuse <eos> lucio : this is the rascal this is he i spoke of <eos> escalus : why thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth and in the witness of his proper ear to call him villain <eos> and then to glance from him to the duke himself to tax him with injustice <eos> take him hence to the rack with him <eos> we'll touse you joint by joint but we will know his purpose <eos> what 'unjust' <eos> duke vincentio : be not so hot the duke dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he dare rack his own : his subject am i not nor here provincial <eos> my business in this state made me a looker on here in vienna where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it o'er-run the stew laws for all faults but faults so countenanced that the strong statutes stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop as much in mock as mark <eos> escalus : slander to the state <eos> away with him to prison <eos> angelo : what can you vouch against him signior lucio <eos> is this the man that you did tell us of <eos> lucio : 'tis he my lord <eos> come hither goodman baldpate : do you know me <eos> duke vincentio : i remember you sir by the sound of your voice : i met you at the prison in the absence of the duke <eos> lucio : o did you so <eos> and do you remember what you said of the duke <eos> duke vincentio : most notedly sir <eos> lucio : do you so sir <eos> and was the duke a fleshmonger a fool and a coward as you then reported him to be <eos> duke vincentio : you must sir change persons with me ere you make that my report : you indeed spoke so of him and much more much worse <eos> lucio : o thou damnable fellow <eos> did not i pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches <eos> duke vincentio : i protest i love the duke as i love myself <eos> angelo : hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses <eos> escalus : such a fellow is not to be talked withal <eos> away with him to prison <eos> where is the provost <eos> away with him to prison <eos> lay bolts enough upon him : let him speak no more <eos> away with those giglots too and with the other confederate companion <eos> duke vincentio : angelo : what resists he <eos> help him lucio <eos> lucio : come sir come sir come sir foh sir <eos> why you bald-pated lying rascal you must be hooded must you <eos> show your knave's visage with a pox to you <eos> show your sheep-biting face and be hanged an hour <eos> will't not off <eos> duke vincentio : thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke <eos> first provost let me bail these gentle three <eos> sneak not away sir for the friar and you must have a word anon <eos> lay hold on him <eos> lucio : this may prove worse than hanging <eos> duke vincentio : angelo : o my dread lord i should be guiltier than my guiltiness to think i can be undiscernible when i perceive your grace like power divine hath look'd upon my passes <eos> then good prince no longer session hold upon my shame but let my trial be mine own confession : immediate sentence then and sequent death is all the grace i beg <eos> duke vincentio : come hither mariana <eos> say wast thou e'er contracted to this woman <eos> angelo : i was my lord <eos> duke vincentio : go take her hence and marry her instantly <eos> do you the office friar which consummate return him here again <eos> go with him provost <eos> escalus : my lord i am more amazed at his dishonour than at the strangeness of it <eos> duke vincentio : come hither isabel <eos> your friar is now your prince : as i was then advertising and holy to your business not changing heart with habit i am still attorney'd at your service <eos> isabella : o give me pardon that i your vassal have employ'd and pain'd your unknown sovereignty <eos> duke vincentio : you are pardon'd isabel : and now dear maid be you as free to us <eos> your brother's death i know sits at your heart and you may marvel why i obscured myself labouring to save his life and would not rather make rash remonstrance of my hidden power than let him so be lost <eos> o most kind maid it was the swift celerity of his death which i did think with slower foot came on that brain'd my purpose <eos> but peace be with him <eos> that life is better life past fearing death than that which lives to fear : make it your comfort so happy is your brother <eos> isabella : i do my lord <eos> duke vincentio : for this new-married man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd your well defended honour you must pardon for mariana's sake : but as he adjudged your brother <eos> being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promise-breach thereon dependent for your brother's life <eos> the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue 'an angelo for claudio death for death <eos>' haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure <eos> then angelo thy fault's thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage <eos> we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste <eos> away with him <eos> mariana : o my most gracious lord i hope you will not mock me with a husband <eos> duke vincentio : it is your husband mock'd you with a husband <eos> consenting to the safeguard of your honour i thought your marriage fit else imputation for that he knew you might reproach your life and choke your good to come for his possessions although by confiscation they are ours we do instate and widow you withal to buy you a better husband <eos> mariana : o my dear lord i crave no other nor no better man <eos> duke vincentio : never crave him we are definitive <eos> mariana : gentle my liege <eos> duke vincentio : you do but lose your labour <eos> away with him to death <eos> now sir to you <eos> mariana : o my good lord <eos> sweet isabel take my part lend me your knees and all my life to come i'll lend you all my life to do you service <eos> duke vincentio : against all sense you do importune her : should she kneel down in mercy of this fact her brother's ghost his paved bed would break and take her hence in horror <eos> mariana : isabel sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me hold up your hands say nothing i'll speak all <eos> they say best men are moulded out of faults and for the most become much more the better for being a little bad : so may my husband <eos> o isabel will you not lend a knee <eos> duke vincentio : he dies for claudio's death <eos> isabella : most bounteous sir look if it please you on this man condemn'd as if my brother lived : i partly think a due sincerity govern'd his deeds till he did look on me : since it is so let him not die <eos> my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died : for angelo his act did not o'ertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perish'd by the way : thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughts <eos> mariana : merely my lord <eos> duke vincentio : your suit's unprofitable stand up i say <eos> i have bethought me of another fault <eos> provost how came it claudio was beheaded at an unusual hour <eos> provost : it was commanded so <eos> duke vincentio : had you a special warrant for the deed <eos> provost : no my good lord it was by private message <eos> duke vincentio : for which i do discharge you of your office : give up your keys <eos> provost : pardon me noble lord : i thought it was a fault but knew it not yet did repent me after more advice for testimony whereof one in the prison that should by private order else have died i have reserved alive <eos> duke vincentio : what's he <eos> provost : his name is barnardine <eos> duke vincentio : i would thou hadst done so by claudio <eos> go fetch him hither let me look upon him <eos> escalus : i am sorry one so learned and so wise as you lord angelo have still appear'd should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood <eos> and lack of temper'd judgment afterward <eos> angelo : i am sorry that such sorrow i procure : and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart that i crave death more willingly than mercy 'tis my deserving and i do entreat it <eos> duke vincentio : which is that barnardine <eos> provost : this my lord <eos> duke vincentio : there was a friar told me of this man <eos> sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul <eos> that apprehends no further than this world and squarest thy life according <eos> thou'rt condemn'd : but for those earthly faults i quit them all and pray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to come <eos> friar advise him i leave him to your hand <eos> what muffled fellow's that <eos> provost : this is another prisoner that i saved <eos> who should have died when claudio lost his head as like almost to claudio as himself <eos> duke vincentio : lucio : 'faith my lord <eos> i spoke it but according to the trick <eos> if you will hang me for it you may but i had rather it would please you i might be whipt <eos> duke vincentio : whipt first sir and hanged after <eos> proclaim it provost round about the city <eos> is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow as i have heard him swear himself there's one whom he begot with child let her appear and he shall marry her : the nuptial finish'd let him be whipt and hang'd <eos> lucio : i beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore <eos> your highness said even now i made you a duke : good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold <eos> duke vincentio : upon mine honour thou shalt marry her <eos> thy slanders i forgive and therewithal remit thy other forfeits <eos> take him to prison and see our pleasure herein executed <eos> lucio : marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping and hanging <eos> duke vincentio : slandering a prince deserves it <eos> she claudio that you wrong'd look you restore <eos> joy to you mariana <eos> love her angelo : i have confess'd her and i know her virtue <eos> thanks good friend escalus for thy much goodness : there's more behind that is more gratulate <eos> thanks provost for thy care and secrecy : we shill employ thee in a worthier place <eos> forgive him angelo that brought you home the head of ragozine for claudio's : the offence pardons itself <eos> dear isabel i have a motion much imports your good whereto if you'll a willing ear incline what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine <eos> so bring us to our palace where we'll show what's yet behind that's meet you all should know <eos> sly : i'll pheeze you in faith <eos> hostess : a pair of stocks you rogue <eos> sly : ye are a baggage : the slys are no rogues look in the chronicles we came in with richard conqueror <eos> therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide : sessa <eos> hostess : you will not pay for the glasses you have burst <eos> sly : no not a denier <eos> go by jeronimy : go to thy cold bed and warm thee <eos> hostess : i know my remedy i must go fetch the third <eos>borough <eos> sly : third or fourth or fifth borough i'll answer him by law : i'll not budge an inch boy : let him come and kindly <eos> lord : huntsman i charge thee tender well my hounds : brach merriman the poor cur is emboss'd and couple clowder with the deep <eos>mouth'd brach <eos> saw'st thou not boy how silver made it good at the hedge-corner in the coldest fault <eos> i would not lose the dog for twenty pound <eos> first huntsman : why belman is as good as he my lord he cried upon it at the merest loss and twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent : trust me i take him for the better dog <eos> lord : thou art a fool : if echo were as fleet i would esteem him worth a dozen such <eos> but sup them well and look unto them all : to-morrow i intend to hunt again <eos> first huntsman : i will my lord <eos> lord : what's here <eos> one dead or drunk <eos> see doth he breathe <eos> second huntsman : he breathes my lord <eos> were he not warm'd with ale this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly <eos> lord : o monstrous beast <eos> how like a swine he lies <eos> grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image <eos> sirs i will practise on this drunken man <eos> what think you if he were convey'd to bed wrapp'd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers a most delicious banquet by his bed and brave attendants near him when he wakes would not the beggar then forget himself <eos> first huntsman : believe me lord i think he cannot choose <eos> second huntsman : it would seem strange unto him when he waked <eos> lord : even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy <eos> then take him up and manage well the jest : carry him gently to my fairest chamber and hang it round with all my wanton pictures : balm his foul head in warm distilled waters and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet : procure me music ready when he wakes to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound and if he chance to speak be ready straight and with a low submissive reverence say 'what is it your honour will command <eos>' let one attend him with a silver basin full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers another bear the ewer the third a diaper and say 'will't please your lordship cool your hands <eos>' some one be ready with a costly suit and ask him what apparel he will wear another tell him of his hounds and horse and that his lady mourns at his disease : persuade him that he hath been lunatic and when he says he is say that he dreams for he is nothing but a mighty lord <eos> this do and do it kindly gentle sirs : it will be pastime passing excellent if it be husbanded with modesty <eos> first huntsman : my lord i warrant you we will play our part as he shall think by our true diligence he is no less than what we say he is <eos> lord : take him up gently and to bed with him and each one to his office when he wakes <eos> sirrah go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds : belike some noble gentleman that means travelling some journey to repose him here <eos> how now <eos> who is it <eos> servant : an't please your honour players that offer service to your lordship <eos> lord : bid them come near <eos> now fellows you are welcome <eos> players : we thank your honour <eos> lord : do you intend to stay with me tonight <eos> a player : so please your lordship to accept our duty <eos> lord : with all my heart <eos> this fellow i remember since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son : 'twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well : i have forgot your name but sure that part was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd <eos> a player : i think 'twas soto that your honour means <eos> lord : 'tis very true : thou didst it excellent <eos> well you are come to me in a happy time the rather for i have some sport in hand wherein your cunning can assist me much <eos> there is a lord will hear you play to-night : but i am doubtful of your modesties lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior <eos> for yet his honour never heard a play <eos> you break into some merry passion and so offend him for i tell you sirs if you should smile he grows impatient <eos> a player : fear not my lord : we can contain ourselves were he the veriest antic in the world <eos> lord : go sirrah take them to the buttery and give them friendly welcome every one : let them want nothing that my house affords <eos> sirrah go you to barthol'mew my page and see him dress'd in all suits like a lady : that done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber and call him 'madam' do him obeisance <eos> tell him from me as he will win my love he bear himself with honourable action such as he hath observed in noble ladies unto their lords by them accomplished : such duty to the drunkard let him do with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy and say 'what is't your honour will command wherein your lady and your humble wife may show her duty and make known her love <eos>' and then with kind embracements tempting kisses and with declining head into his bosom bid him shed tears as being overjoy'd to see her noble lord restored to health who for this seven years hath esteem'd him no better than a poor and loathsome beggar : and if the boy have not a woman's gift to rain a shower of commanded tears an onion will do well for such a shift which in a napkin being close convey'd shall in despite enforce a watery eye <eos> see this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst : anon i'll give thee more instructions <eos> i know the boy will well usurp the grace voice gait and action of a gentlewoman : i long to hear him call the drunkard husband and how my men will stay themselves from laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant <eos> i'll in to counsel them haply my presence may well abate the over-merry spleen which otherwise would grow into extremes <eos> sly : for god's sake a pot of small ale <eos> first servant : will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack <eos> second servant : will't please your honour taste of these conserves <eos> third servant : what raiment will your honour wear to-day <eos> sly : i am christophero sly call not me 'honour' nor 'lordship :' i ne'er drank sack in my life and if you give me any conserves give me conserves of beef : ne'er ask me what raiment i'll wear for i have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay sometimes more feet than shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather <eos> lord : heaven cease this idle humour in your honour <eos> o that a mighty man of such descent of such possessions and so high esteem should be infused with so foul a spirit <eos> sly : what would you make me mad <eos> am not i christopher sly old sly's son of burtonheath by birth a pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bear-herd and now by present profession a tinker <eos> ask marian hacket the fat ale-wife of wincot if she know me not : if she say i am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale score me up for the lyingest knave in christendom <eos> what <eos> i am not bestraught : here's <eos> third servant : o this it is that makes your lady mourn <eos> second servant : o this is it that makes your servants droop <eos> lord : hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house as beaten hence by your strange lunacy <eos> o noble lord bethink thee of thy birth call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment and banish hence these abject lowly dreams <eos> look how thy servants do attend on thee each in his office ready at thy beck <eos> wilt thou have music <eos> hark <eos> apollo plays and twenty caged nightingales do sing : or wilt thou sleep <eos> we'll have thee to a couch softer and sweeter than the lustful bed on purpose trimm'd up for semiramis <eos> say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground : or wilt thou ride <eos> thy horses shall be trapp'd their harness studded all with gold and pearl <eos> dost thou love hawking <eos> thou hast hawks will soar above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt <eos> thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth <eos> first servant : say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift as breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe <eos> second servant : dost thou love pictures <eos> we will fetch thee straight adonis painted by a running brook and cytherea all in sedges hid which seem to move and wanton with her breath even as the waving sedges play with wind <eos> lord : we'll show thee io as she was a maid and how she was beguiled and surprised as lively painted as the deed was done <eos> third servant : or daphne roaming through a thorny wood scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds and at that sight shall sad apollo weep so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn <eos> lord : thou art a lord and nothing but a lord : thou hast a lady far more beautiful than any woman in this waning age <eos> first servant : and till the tears that she hath shed for thee like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face she was the fairest creature in the world and yet she is inferior to none <eos> sly : am i a lord <eos> and have i such a lady <eos> or do i dream <eos> or have i dream'd till now <eos> i do not sleep : i see i hear i speak i smell sweet savours and i feel soft things : upon my life i am a lord indeed and not a tinker nor christophero sly <eos> well bring our lady hither to our sight and once again a pot o' the smallest ale <eos> second servant : will't please your mightiness to wash your hands <eos> o how we joy to see your wit restored <eos> o that once more you knew but what you are <eos> these fifteen years you have been in a dream or when you waked so waked as if you slept <eos> sly : these fifteen years <eos> by my fay a goodly nap <eos> but did i never speak of all that time <eos> first servant : o yes my lord but very idle words : for though you lay here in this goodly chamber yet would you say ye were beaten out of door and rail upon the hostess of the house and say you would present her at the leet because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts : sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket <eos> sly : ay the woman's maid of the house <eos> third servant : why sir you know no house nor no such maid nor no such men as you have reckon'd up as stephen sly and did john naps of greece and peter turph and henry pimpernell and twenty more such names and men as these which never were nor no man ever saw <eos> sly : now lord be thanked for my good amends

lords call ladies <eos> sly : madam wife they say that i have dream'd and slept above some fifteen year or more <eos> page : ay and the time seems thirty unto me being all this time abandon'd from your bed <eos> sly : 'tis much <eos> servants leave me and her alone <eos> madam undress you and come now to bed <eos> page : thrice noble lord let me entreat of you to pardon me yet for a night or two or if not so until the sun be set : for your physicians have expressly charged in peril to incur your former malady that i should yet absent me from your bed : i hope this reason stands for my excuse <eos> sly : ay it stands so that i may hardly tarry so long <eos> but i would be loath to fall into my dreams again : i will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood <eos> messenger : your honour's players heating your amendment are come to play a pleasant comedy for so your doctors hold it very meet seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy : therefore they thought it good you hear a play and frame your mind to mirth and merriment which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life <eos> sly : marry i will let them play it <eos> is not a comondy a christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick <eos> page : no my good lord it is more pleasing stuff <eos> sly : what household stuff <eos> page : it is a kind of history <eos> sly : well well see't <eos> come madam wife sit by my side and let the world slip : we shall ne'er be younger <eos> lucentio : tranio since for the great desire i had to see fair padua nursery of arts i am arrived for fruitful lombardy the pleasant garden of great italy and by my father's love and leave am arm'd with his good will and thy good company my trusty servant well approved in all here let us breathe and haply institute a course of learning and ingenious studies <eos> pisa renown'd for grave citizens gave me my being and my father first a merchant of great traffic through the world vincetino come of bentivolii <eos> vincetino's son brought up in florence it shall become to serve all hopes conceived to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds : and therefore tranio for the time i study virtue and that part of philosophy will i apply that treats of happiness by virtue specially to be achieved <eos> tell me thy mind for i have pisa left and am to padua come as he that leaves a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst <eos> tranio : mi perdonato gentle master mine i am in all affected as yourself glad that you thus continue your resolve to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy <eos> only good master while we do admire this virtue and this moral discipline let's be no stoics nor no stocks i pray or so devote to aristotle's cheques as ovid be an outcast quite abjured : balk logic with acquaintance that you have and practise rhetoric in your common talk music and poesy use to quicken you the mathematics and the metaphysics fall to them as you find your stomach serves you no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en : in brief sir study what you most affect <eos> lucentio : gramercies tranio well dost thou advise <eos> if biondello thou wert come ashore we could at once put us in readiness and take a lodging fit to entertain such friends as time in padua shall beget <eos> but stay a while : what company is this <eos> tranio : master some show to welcome us to town <eos> baptista : gentlemen importune me no farther for how i firmly am resolved you know that is not bestow my youngest daughter before i have a husband for the elder : if either of you both love katharina because i know you well and love you well leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure <eos> gremio : katharina : i pray you sir is it your will to make a stale of me amongst these mates <eos> hortensio : mates maid <eos> how mean you that <eos> no mates for you unless you were of gentler milder mould <eos> katharina : i'faith sir you shall never need to fear : i wis it is not half way to her heart but if it were doubt not her care should be to comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool and paint your face and use you like a fool <eos> hortensia : from all such devils good lord deliver us <eos> gremio : and me too good lord <eos> tranio : hush master <eos> here's some good pastime toward : that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward <eos> lucentio : but in the other's silence do i see maid's mild behavior and sobriety <eos> peace tranio <eos> tranio : well said master mum <eos> and gaze your fill <eos> baptista : gentlemen that i may soon make good what i have said bianca get you in : and let it not displease thee good bianca for i will love thee ne'er the less my girl <eos> katharina : a pretty peat <eos> it is best put finger in the eye an she knew why <eos> bianca : sister content you in my discontent <eos> sir to your pleasure humbly i subscribe : my books and instruments shall be my company on them to took and practise by myself <eos> lucentio : hark tranio <eos> thou may'st hear minerva speak <eos> hortensio : signior baptista will you be so strange <eos> sorry am i that our good will effects bianca's grief <eos> gremio : why will you mew her up signior baptista for this fiend of hell and make her bear the penance of her tongue <eos> baptista : gentlemen content ye i am resolved : go in bianca : and for i know she taketh most delight in music instruments and poetry schoolmasters will i keep within my house fit to instruct her youth <eos> if you hortensio or signior gremio you know any such prefer them hither for to cunning men i will be very kind and liberal to mine own children in good bringing up : and so farewell <eos> katharina you may stay for i have more to commune with bianca <eos> katharina : why and i trust i may go too may i not <eos> what shall i be appointed hours as though belike i knew not what to take and what to leave ha <eos> gremio : you may go to the devil's dam : your gifts are so good here's none will hold you <eos> their love is not so great hortensio but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out : our cakes dough on both sides <eos> farewell : yet for the love i bear my sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights i will wish him to her father <eos> hortensio : so will i signior gremio : but a word i pray <eos> though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in bianco's love to labour and effect one thing specially <eos> gremio : what's that i pray <eos> hortensio : marry sir to get a husband for her sister <eos> gremio : a husband <eos> a devil <eos> hortensio : i say a husband <eos> gremio : i say a devil <eos> thinkest thou hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell <eos> hortensio : tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough <eos> gremio : i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whipped at the high cross every morning <eos> hortensio : faith as you say there's small choice in rotten apples <eos> but come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintained all by helping baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have to't a fresh <eos> sweet bianca <eos> happy man be his dole <eos> he that runs fastest gets the ring <eos> how say you signior gremio <eos> gremio : i am agreed and would i had given him the best horse in padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her <eos> come on <eos> tranio : i pray sir tell me is it possible that love should of a sudden take such hold <eos> lucentio : o tranio till i found it to be true i never thought it possible or likely but see while idly i stood looking on i found the effect of love in idleness : and now in plainness do confess to thee that art to me as secret and as dear as anna to the queen of carthage was tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio if i achieve not this young modest girl <eos> counsel me tranio for i know thou canst assist me tranio for i know thou wilt <eos> tranio : master it is no time to chide you now affection is not rated from the heart : if love have touch'd you nought remains but so 'redime te captum quam queas minimo <eos>' lucentio : gramercies lad go forward this contents : the rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound <eos> tranio : master you look'd so longly on the maid perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all <eos> lucentio : o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face such as the daughter of agenor had that made great jove to humble him to her hand <eos> when with his knees he kiss'd the cretan strand <eos> tranio : saw you no more <eos> mark'd you not how her sister began to scold and raise up such a storm that mortal ears might hardly endure the din <eos> lucentio : tranio i saw her coral lips to move and with her breath she did perfume the air : sacred and sweet was all i saw in her <eos> tranio : nay then 'tis time to stir him from his trance <eos> i pray awake sir : if you love the maid bend thoughts and wits to achieve her <eos> thus it stands : her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd that till the father rid his hands of her master your love must live a maid at home and therefore has he closely mew'd her up because she will not be annoy'd with suitors <eos> lucentio : ah tranio what a cruel father's he <eos> but art thou not advised he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her <eos> tranio : ay marry am i sir and now 'tis plotted <eos> lucentio : i have it tranio <eos> tranio : master for my hand both our inventions meet and jump in one <eos> lucentio : tell me thine first <eos> tranio : you will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid : that's your device <eos> lucentio : it is : may it be done <eos> tranio : not possible for who shall bear your part and be in padua here vincentio's son keep house and ply his book welcome his friends visit his countrymen and banquet them <eos> lucentio : basta content thee for i have it full <eos> we have not yet been seen in any house nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces for man or master then it follows thus thou shalt be master tranio in my stead keep house and port and servants as i should : i will some other be some florentine some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa <eos> 'tis hatch'd and shall be so : tranio at once uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak : when biondello comes he waits on thee but i will charm him first to keep his tongue <eos> tranio : so had you need <eos> in brief sir sith it your pleasure is and i am tied to be obedient for so your father charged me at our parting 'be serviceable to my son' quoth he although i think 'twas in another sense i am content to be lucentio because so well i love lucentio <eos> lucentio : tranio be so because lucentio loves : and let me be a slave to achieve that maid whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye <eos> here comes the rogue <eos> sirrah where have you been <eos> biondello : where have i been <eos> nay how now <eos> where are you <eos> master has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes <eos> or you stolen his <eos> or both <eos> pray what's the news <eos> lucentio : sirrah come hither : 'tis no time to jest and therefore frame your manners to the time <eos> your fellow tranio here to save my life puts my apparel and my countenance on and i for my escape have put on his for in a quarrel since i came ashore i kill'd a man and fear i was descried : wait you on him i charge you as becomes while i make way from hence to save my life : you understand me <eos> biondello : i sir <eos> ne'er a whit <eos> lucentio : and not a jot of tranio in your mouth : tranio is changed into lucentio <eos> biondello : the better for him : would i were so too <eos> tranio : so could i faith boy to have the next wish after that lucentio indeed had baptista's youngest daughter <eos> but sirrah not for my sake but your master's i advise you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies : when i am alone why then i am tranio but in all places else your master lucentio <eos> lucentio : tranio let's go : one thing more rests that thyself execute to make one among these wooers : if thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty <eos> first servant : my lord you nod you do not mind the play <eos> sly : yes by saint anne do i <eos> a good matter surely : comes there any more of it <eos> page : my lord 'tis but begun <eos> sly : 'tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady : would 'twere done <eos> petruchio : verona for a while i take my leave to see my friends in padua but of all my best beloved and approved friend hortensio and i trow this is his house <eos> here sirrah grumio knock i say <eos> grumio : knock sir <eos> whom should i knock <eos> is there man has rebused your worship <eos> petruchio : villain i say knock me here soundly <eos> grumio : knock you here sir <eos> why sir what am i sir that i should knock you here sir <eos> petruchio : villain i say knock me at this gate and rap me well or i'll knock your knave's pate <eos> grumio : my master is grown quarrelsome <eos> i should knock you first and then i know after who comes by the worst <eos> petruchio : will it not be <eos> faith sirrah an you'll not knock i'll ring it i'll try how you can sol fa and sing it <eos> grumio : help masters help <eos> my master is mad <eos> petruchio : now knock when i bid you sirrah villain <eos> hortensio : how now <eos> what's the matter <eos> my old friend grumio <eos> and my good friend petruchio <eos> how do you all at verona <eos> petruchio : signior hortensio come you to part the fray <eos> 'con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may i say <eos> hortensio : 'alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor mio petruchio <eos>' rise grumio rise : we will compound this quarrel <eos> grumio : nay 'tis no matter sir what he 'leges in latin <eos> if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir : well was it fit for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught i see two and thirty a pip out <eos> whom would to god i had well knock'd at first then had not grumio come by the worst <eos> petruchio : a senseless villain <eos> good hortensio i bade the rascal knock upon your gate and could not get him for my heart to do it <eos> grumio : knock at the gate <eos> o heavens <eos> spake you not these words plain 'sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly' <eos> and come you now with 'knocking at the gate' <eos> petruchio : sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you <eos> hortensio : petruchio patience i am grumio's pledge : why this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio <eos> and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale blows you to padua here from old verona <eos> petruchio : such wind as scatters young men through the world to seek their fortunes farther than at home where small experience grows <eos> but in a few signior hortensio thus it stands with me : antonio my father is deceased and i have thrust myself into this maze haply to wive and thrive as best i may : crowns in my purse i have and goods at home and so am come abroad to see the world <eos> hortensio : petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee and wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife <eos> thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel : and yet i'll promise thee she shall be rich and very rich : but thou'rt too much my friend and i'll not wish thee to her <eos> petruchio : signior hortensio 'twixt such friends as we few words suffice and therefore if thou know one rich enough to be petruchio's wife as wealth is burden of my wooing dance be she as foul as was florentius' love as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd as socrates' xanthippe or a worse she moves me not or not removes at least affection's edge in me were she as rough as are the swelling adriatic seas : i come to wive it wealthily in padua if wealthily then happily in padua <eos> grumio : nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is : why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses : why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal <eos> hortensio : petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in i will continue that i broach'd in jest <eos> i can petruchio help thee to a wife with wealth enough and young and beauteous brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman : her only fault and that is faults enough is that she is intolerable curst and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure that were my state far worser than it is i would not wed her for a mine of gold <eos> petruchio : hortensio peace <eos> thou know'st not gold's effect : tell me her father's name and 'tis enough for i will board her though she chide as loud as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack <eos> hortensio : her father is baptista minola an affable and courteous gentleman : her name is katharina minola renown'd in padua for her scolding tongue <eos> petruchio : i know her father though i know not her and he knew my deceased father well <eos> i will not sleep hortensio till i see her and therefore let me be thus bold with you to give you over at this first encounter unless you will accompany me thither <eos> grumio : i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts <eos> o' my word an she knew him as well as i do she would think scolding would do little good upon him : she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so : why that's nothing an he begin once he'll rail in his rope-tricks <eos> i'll tell you what sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat <eos> you know him not sir <eos> hortensio : tarry petruchio i must go with thee for in baptista's keep my treasure is : he hath the jewel of my life in hold his youngest daughter beautiful binaca and her withholds from me and other more suitors to her and rivals in my love supposing it a thing impossible for those defects i have before rehearsed that ever katharina will be woo'd therefore this order hath baptista ta'en that none shall have access unto bianca till katharina the curst have got a husband <eos> grumio : katharina the curst <eos> a title for a maid of all titles the worst <eos> hortensio : now shall my friend petruchio do me grace and offer me disguised in sober robes to old baptista as a schoolmaster well seen in music to instruct bianca that so i may by this device at least have leave and leisure to make love to her and unsuspected court her by herself <eos> grumio : here's no knavery <eos> see to beguile the old folks how the young folks lay their heads together <eos> master master look about you : who goes there ha <eos> hortensio : peace grumio <eos> it is the rival of my love <eos> petruchio stand by a while <eos> grumio : a proper stripling and an amorous <eos> gremio : o very well i have perused the note <eos> hark you sir : i'll have them very fairly bound : all books of love see that at any hand and see you read no other lectures to her : you understand me : over and beside signior baptista's liberality i'll mend it with a largess <eos> take your paper too and let me have them very well perfumed for she is sweeter than perfume itself to whom they go to <eos> what will you read to her <eos> lucentio : whate'er i read to her i'll plead for you as for my patron stand you so assured as firmly as yourself were still in place : yea and perhaps with more successful words than you unless you were a scholar sir <eos> gremio : o this learning what a thing it is <eos> grumio : o this woodcock what an ass it is <eos> petruchio : peace sirrah <eos> hortensio : grumio mum <eos> god save you signior gremio <eos> gremio : and you are well met signior hortensio <eos> trow you whither i am going <eos> to baptista minola <eos> i promised to inquire carefully about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca : and by good fortune i have lighted well on this young man for learning and behavior fit for her turn well read in poetry and other books good ones i warrant ye <eos> hortensio : 'tis well and i have met a gentleman hath promised me to help me to another a fine musician to instruct our mistress so shall i no whit be behind in duty to fair bianca so beloved of me <eos> gremio : beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove <eos> grumio : and that his bags shall prove <eos> hortensio : gremio 'tis now no time to vent our love : listen to me and if you speak me fair i'll tell you news indifferent good for either <eos> here is a gentleman whom by chance i met upon agreement from us to his liking will undertake to woo curst katharina yea and to marry her if her dowry please <eos> gremio : so said so done is well <eos> hortensio have you told him all her faults <eos> petruchio : i know she is an irksome brawling scold : if that be all masters i hear no harm <eos> gremio : no say'st me so friend <eos> what countryman <eos> petruchio : born in verona old antonio's son : my father dead my fortune lives for me and i do hope good days and long to see <eos> gremio : o sir such a life with such a wife were strange <eos> but if you have a stomach to't i' god's name : you shall have me assisting you in all <eos> but will you woo this wild-cat <eos> petruchio : will i live <eos> grumio : will he woo her <eos> ay or i'll hang her <eos> petruchio : why came i hither but to that intent <eos> think you a little din can daunt mine ears <eos> have i not in my time heard lions roar <eos> have i not heard the sea puff'd up with winds rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat <eos> have i not heard great ordnance in the field and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies <eos> have i not in a pitched battle heard loud 'larums neighing steeds and trumpets' clang <eos> and do you tell me of a woman's tongue that gives not half so great a blow to hear as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire <eos> tush tush <eos> fear boys with bugs <eos> grumio : for he fears none <eos> gremio : hortensio hark : this gentleman is happily arrived my mind presumes for his own good and ours <eos> hortensio : i promised we would be contributors and bear his charging of wooing whatsoe'er <eos> gremio : and so we will provided that he win her <eos> grumio : i would i were as sure of a good dinner <eos> tranio : gentlemen god save you <eos> if i may be bold tell me i beseech you which is the readiest way to the house of signior baptista minola <eos> biondello : he that has the two fair daughters : is't he you mean <eos> tranio : even he biondello <eos> gremio : hark you sir you mean not her to <eos> tranio : perhaps him and her sir : what have you to do <eos> petruchio : not her that chides sir at any hand i pray <eos> tranio : i love no chiders sir <eos> biondello let's away <eos> lucentio : well begun tranio <eos> hortensio : sir a word ere you go are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no <eos> tranio : and if i be sir is it any offence <eos> gremio : no if without more words you will get you hence <eos> tranio : why sir i pray are not the streets as free for me as for you <eos> gremio : but so is not she <eos> tranio : for what reason i beseech you <eos> gremio : for this reason if you'll know that she's the choice love of signior gremio <eos> hortensio : that she's the chosen of signior hortensio <eos> tranio : softly my masters <eos> if you be gentlemen do me this right hear me with patience <eos> baptista is a noble gentleman to whom my father is not all unknown and were his daughter fairer than she is she may more suitors have and me for one <eos> fair leda's daughter had a thousand wooers then well one more may fair bianca have : and so she shall lucentio shall make one though paris came in hope to speed alone <eos> gremio : what <eos> this gentleman will out-talk us all <eos> lucentio : sir give him head : i know he'll prove a jade <eos> petruchio : hortensio to what end are all these words <eos> hortensio : sir let me be so bold as ask you did you yet ever see baptista's daughter <eos> tranio : no sir but hear i do that he hath two the one as famous for a scolding tongue as is the other for beauteous modesty <eos> petruchio : sir sir the first's for me let her go by <eos> gremio : yea leave that labour to great hercules and let it be more than alcides' twelve <eos> petruchio : sir understand you this of me in sooth : the youngest daughter whom you hearken for her father keeps from all access of suitors and will not promise her to any man until the elder sister first be wed : the younger then is free and not before <eos> tranio : if it be so sir that you are the man must stead us all and me amongst the rest and if you break the ice and do this feat achieve the elder set the younger free for our access whose hap shall be to have her will not so graceless be to be ingrate <eos> hortensio : sir you say well and well you do conceive and since you do profess to be a suitor you must as we do gratify this gentleman to whom we all rest generally beholding <eos> tranio : sir i shall not be slack : in sign whereof please ye we may contrive this afternoon and quaff carouses to our mistress' health and do as adversaries do in law strive mightily but eat and drink as friends <eos> grumio : o excellent motion <eos> fellows let's be gone <eos> hortensio : the motion's good indeed and be it so petruchio i shall be your ben venuto <eos> bianca : good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself to make a bondmaid and a slave of me that i disdain : but for these other gawds unbind my hands i'll pull them off myself yea all my raiment to my petticoat or what you will command me will i do so well i know my duty to my elders <eos> katharina : of all thy suitors here i charge thee tell whom thou lovest best : see thou dissemble not <eos> bianca : believe me sister of all the men alive i never yet beheld that special face which i could fancy more than any other <eos> katharina : minion thou liest <eos> is't not hortensio <eos> bianca : if you affect him sister here i swear i'll plead for you myself but you shall have him <eos> katharina : o then belike you fancy riches more : you will have gremio to keep you fair <eos> bianca : is it for him you do envy me so <eos> nay then you jest and now i well perceive you have but jested with me all this while : i prithee sister kate untie my hands <eos> katharina : if that be jest then all the rest was so <eos> baptista : why how now dame <eos> whence grows this insolence <eos> bianca stand aside <eos> poor girl <eos> she weeps <eos> go ply thy needle meddle not with her <eos> for shame thou helding of a devilish spirit why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee <eos> when did she cross thee with a bitter word <eos> katharina : her silence flouts me and i'll be revenged <eos> baptista : what in my sight <eos> bianca get thee in <eos> katharina : what will you not suffer me <eos> nay now i see she is your treasure she must have a husband i must dance bare-foot on her wedding day and for your love to her lead apes in hell <eos> talk not to me : i will go sit and weep till i can find occasion of revenge <eos> baptista : was ever gentleman thus grieved as i <eos> but who comes here <eos> gremio : good morrow neighbour baptista <eos> baptista : good morrow neighbour gremio <eos> god save you gentlemen <eos> petruchio : and you good sir <eos> pray have you not a daughter call'd katharina fair and virtuous <eos> baptista : i have a daughter sir called katharina <eos> gremio : you are too blunt : go to it orderly <eos> petruchio : you wrong me signior gremio : give me leave <eos> i am a gentleman of verona sir that hearing of her beauty and her wit her affability and bashful modesty her wondrous qualities and mild behavior am bold to show myself a forward guest within your house to make mine eye the witness of that report which i so oft have heard <eos> and for an entrance to my entertainment i do present you with a man of mine cunning in music and the mathematics to instruct her fully in those sciences whereof i know she is not ignorant : accept of him or else you do me wrong : his name is licio born in mantua <eos> baptista : you're welcome sir and he for your good sake <eos> but for my daughter katharina this i know she is not for your turn the more my grief <eos> petruchio : i see you do not mean to part with her or else you like not of my company <eos> baptista : mistake me not i speak but as i find <eos> whence are you sir <eos> what may i call your name <eos> petruchio : petruchio is my name antonio's son a man well known throughout all italy <eos> baptista : i know him well : you are welcome for his sake <eos> gremio : saving your tale petruchio i pray let us that are poor petitioners speak too : baccare <eos> you are marvellous forward <eos> petruchio : o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing <eos> gremio : i doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing <eos> neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am sure of it <eos> to express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar that hath been long studying at rheims as cunning in greek latin and other languages as the other in music and mathematics : his name is cambio pray accept his service <eos> baptista : a thousand thanks signior gremio <eos> welcome good cambio <eos> but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger : may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming <eos> tranio : pardon me sir the boldness is mine own that being a stranger in this city here do make myself a suitor to your daughter unto bianca fair and virtuous <eos> nor is your firm resolve unknown to me in the preferment of the eldest sister <eos> this liberty is all that i request that upon knowledge of my parentage i may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo and free access and favour as the rest : and toward the education of your daughters i here bestow a simple instrument and this small packet of greek and latin books : if you accept them then their worth is great <eos> baptista : lucentio is your name of whence i pray <eos> tranio : of pisa sir son to vincentio <eos> baptista : a mighty man of pisa by report i know him well : you are very welcome sir take you the lute and you the set of books you shall go see your pupils presently <eos> holla within <eos> sirrah lead these gentlemen to my daughters and tell them both these are their tutors : bid them use them well <eos> we will go walk a little in the orchard and then to dinner <eos> you are passing welcome and so i pray you all to think yourselves <eos> petruchio : signior baptista my business asketh haste and every day i cannot come to woo <eos> you knew my father well and in him me left solely heir to all his lands and goods which i have better'd rather than decreased : then tell me if i get your daughter's love what dowry shall i have with her to wife <eos> baptista : after my death the one half of my lands and in possession twenty thousand crowns <eos> petruchio : and for that dowry i'll assure her of her widowhood be it that she survive me in all my lands and leases whatsoever : let specialties be therefore drawn between us that covenants may be kept on either hand <eos> baptista : ay when the special thing is well obtain'd that is her love for that is all in all <eos> petruchio : why that is nothing : for i tell you father i am as peremptory as she proud-minded and where two raging fires meet together they do consume the thing that feeds their fury : though little fire grows great with little wind yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all : so i to her and so she yields to me for i am rough and woo not like a babe <eos> baptista : well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed <eos> but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words <eos> petruchio : ay to the proof as mountains are for winds that shake not though they blow perpetually <eos> baptista : how now my friend <eos> why dost thou look so pale <eos> hortensio : for fear i promise you if i look pale <eos> baptista : what will my daughter prove a good musician <eos> hortensio : i think she'll sooner prove a soldier iron may hold with her but never lutes <eos> baptista : why then thou canst not break her to the lute <eos> hortensio : why no for she hath broke the lute to me <eos> i did but tell her she mistook her frets and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering when with a most impatient devilish spirit 'frets call you these <eos>' quoth she 'i'll fume with them :' and with that word she struck me on the head and through the instrument my pate made way and there i stood amazed for a while as on a pillory looking through the lute while she did call me rascal fiddler and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms as had she studied to misuse me so <eos> petruchio : now by the world it is a lusty wench i love her ten times more than e'er i did : o how i long to have some chat with her <eos> baptista : well go with me and be not so discomfited : proceed in practise with my younger daughter she's apt to learn and thankful for good turns <eos> signior petruchio will you go with us or shall i send my daughter kate to you <eos> petruchio : i pray you do <eos> i will attend her here and woo her with some spirit when she comes <eos> say that she rail why then i'll tell her plain she sings as sweetly as a nightingale : say that she frown i'll say she looks as clear as morning roses newly wash'd with dew : say she be mute and will not speak a word then i'll commend her volubility and say she uttereth piercing eloquence : if she do bid me pack i'll give her thanks as though she bid me stay by her a week : if she deny to wed i'll crave the day when i shall ask the banns and when be married <eos> but here she comes and now petruchio speak <eos> good morrow kate for that's your name i hear <eos> katharina : well have you heard but something hard of hearing : they call me katharina that do talk of me <eos> petruchio : you lie in faith for you are call'd plain kate and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst but kate the prettiest kate in christendom kate of kate hall my super-dainty kate for dainties are all kates and therefore kate take this of me kate of my consolation hearing thy mildness praised in every town thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded yet not so deeply as to thee belongs myself am moved to woo thee for my wife <eos> katharina : moved <eos> in good time : let him that moved you hither remove you hence : i knew you at the first you were a moveable <eos> petruchio : why what's a moveable <eos> katharina : a join'd-stool <eos> petruchio : thou hast hit it : come sit on me <eos> katharina : asses are made to bear and so are you <eos> petruchio : women are made to bear and so are you <eos> katharina : no such jade as you if me you mean <eos> petruchio : alas <eos> good kate i will not burden thee for knowing thee to be but young and light <eos> katharina : too light for such a swain as you to catch and yet as heavy as my weight should be <eos> petruchio : should be <eos> should <eos>buzz <eos> katharina : well ta'en and like a buzzard <eos> petruchio : o slow-wing'd turtle <eos> shall a buzzard take thee <eos> katharina : ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard <eos> petruchio : come come you wasp i' faith you are too angry <eos> katharina : if i be waspish best beware my sting <eos> petruchio : my remedy is then to pluck it out <eos> katharina : ay if the fool could find it where it lies petruchio : who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting <eos> in his tail <eos> katharina : in his tongue <eos> petruchio : whose tongue <eos> katharina : yours if you talk of tails : and so farewell <eos> petruchio : what with my tongue in your tail <eos> nay come again good kate i am a gentleman <eos> katharina : that i'll try <eos> petruchio : i swear i'll cuff you if you strike again <eos> katharina : so may you lose your arms : if you strike me you are no gentleman and if no gentleman why then no arms <eos> petruchio : a herald kate <eos> o put me in thy books <eos> katharina : what is your crest <eos> a coxcomb <eos> petruchio : a combless cock so kate will be my hen <eos> katharina : no cock of mine you crow too like a craven <eos> petruchio : nay come kate come you must not look so sour <eos> katharina : it is my fashion when i see a crab <eos> petruchio : why here's no crab and therefore look not sour <eos> katharina : there is there is <eos> petruchio : then show it me <eos> katharina : had i a glass i would <eos> petruchio : what you mean my face <eos> katharina : well aim'd of such a young one <eos> petruchio : now by saint george i am too young for you <eos> katharina : yet you are wither'd <eos> petruchio : 'tis with cares <eos> katharina : i care not <eos> petruchio : nay hear you kate : in sooth you scape not so <eos> katharina : i chafe you if i tarry : let me go <eos> petruchio : no not a whit : i find you passing gentle <eos> 'twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen and now i find report a very liar for thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous but slow in speech yet sweet as spring-time flowers : thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance nor bite the lip as angry wenches will nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers with gentle conference soft and affable <eos> why does the world report that kate doth limp <eos> o slanderous world <eos> kate like the hazel-twig is straight and slender and as brown in hue as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels <eos> o let me see thee walk : thou dost not halt <eos> katharina : go fool and whom thou keep'st command <eos> petruchio : did ever dian so become a grove as kate this chamber with her princely gait <eos> o be thou dian and let her be kate and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful <eos> katharina : where did you study all this goodly speech <eos> petruchio : it is extempore from my mother-wit <eos> katharina : a witty mother <eos> witless else her son <eos> petruchio : am i not wise <eos> katharina : yes keep you warm <eos> petruchio : marry so i mean sweet katharina in thy bed : and therefore setting all this chat aside thus in plain terms : your father hath consented that you shall be my wife your dowry 'greed on and will you nill you i will marry you <eos> now kate i am a husband for your turn for by this light whereby i see thy beauty thy beauty that doth make me like thee well thou must be married to no man but me for i am he am born to tame you kate and bring you from a wild kate to a kate conformable as other household kates <eos> here comes your father : never make denial i must and will have katharina to my wife <eos> baptista : now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter <eos> petruchio : how but well sir <eos> how but well <eos> it were impossible i should speed amiss <eos> baptista : why how now daughter katharina <eos> in your dumps <eos> katharina : call you me daughter <eos> now i promise you you have show'd a tender fatherly regard to wish me wed to one half lunatic a mad-cup ruffian and a swearing jack that thinks with oaths to face the matter out <eos> petruchio : father 'tis thus : yourself and all the world that talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her : if she be curst it is for policy for she's not froward but modest as the dove she is not hot but temperate as the morn for patience she will prove a second grissel and roman lucrece for her chastity : and to conclude we have 'greed so well together that upon sunday is the wedding-day <eos> katharina : i'll see thee hang'd on sunday first <eos> gremio : hark petruchio she says she'll see thee hang'd first <eos> tranio : is this your speeding <eos> nay then good night our part <eos> petruchio : be patient gentlemen i choose her for myself : if she and i be pleased what's that to you <eos> 'tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain being alone that she shall still be curst in company <eos> i tell you 'tis incredible to believe how much she loves me : o the kindest kate <eos> she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss she vied so fast protesting oath on oath that in a twink she won me to her love <eos> o you are novices <eos> 'tis a world to see how tame when men and women are alone a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew <eos> give me thy hand kate : i will unto venice to buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day <eos> provide the feast father and bid the guests i will be sure my katharina shall be fine <eos> baptista : i know not what to say : but give me your hands god send you joy petruchio <eos> 'tis a match <eos> gremio : amen say we : we will be witnesses <eos> petruchio : father and wife and gentlemen adieu i will to venice sunday comes apace : we will have rings and things and fine array and kiss me kate we will be married o'sunday <eos> gremio : was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly <eos> baptista : faith gentlemen now i play a merchant's part and venture madly on a desperate mart <eos> tranio : 'twas a commodity lay fretting by you : 'twill bring you gain or perish on the seas <eos> baptista : the gain i seek is quiet in the match <eos> gremio : no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch <eos> but now baptists to your younger daughter : now is the day we long have looked for : i am your neighbour and was suitor first <eos> tranio : and i am one that love bianca more than words can witness or your thoughts can guess <eos> gremio : youngling thou canst not love so dear as i <eos> tranio : graybeard thy love doth freeze <eos> gremio : but thine doth fry <eos> skipper stand back : 'tis age that nourisheth <eos> tranio : but youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth <eos> baptista : content you gentlemen : i will compound this strife : 'tis deeds must win the prize and he of both that can assure my daughter greatest dower shall have my bianca's love <eos> say signior gremio what can you assure her <eos> gremio : first as you know my house within the city is richly furnished with plate and gold basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands my hangings all of tyrian tapestry in ivory coffers i have stuff'd my crowns in cypress chests my arras counterpoints costly apparel tents and canopies fine linen turkey cushions boss'd with pearl valance of venice gold in needlework pewter and brass and all things that belong to house or housekeeping : then at my farm i have a hundred milch-kine to the pail sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls and all things answerable to this portion <eos> myself am struck in years i must confess and if i die to-morrow this is hers if whilst i live she will be only mine <eos> tranio : that 'only' came well in <eos> sir list to me : i am my father's heir and only son : if i may have your daughter to my wife i'll leave her houses three or four as good within rich pisa walls as any one old signior gremio has in padua besides two thousand ducats by the year of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure <eos> what have i pinch'd you signior gremio <eos> gremio : two thousand ducats by the year of land <eos> my land amounts not to so much in all : that she shall have besides an argosy that now is lying in marseilles' road <eos> what have i choked you with an argosy <eos> tranio : gremio 'tis known my father hath no less than three great argosies besides two galliases and twelve tight galleys : these i will assure her and twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next <eos> gremio : nay i have offer'd all i have no more and she can have no more than all i have : if you like me she shall have me and mine <eos> tranio : why then the maid is mine from all the world by your firm promise : gremio is out-vied <eos> baptista : i must confess your offer is the best and let your father make her the assurance she is your own else you must pardon me if you should die before him where's her dower <eos> tranio : that's but a cavil : he is old i young <eos> gremio : and may not young men die as well as old <eos> baptista : well gentlemen i am thus resolved : on sunday next you know my daughter katharina is to be married : now on the sunday following shall bianca be bride to you if you this assurance if not signior gremio : and so i take my leave and thank you both <eos> gremio : adieu good neighbour <eos> now i fear thee not : sirrah young gamester your father were a fool to give thee all and in his waning age set foot under thy table : tut a toy <eos> an old italian fox is not so kind my boy <eos> tranio : a vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide <eos> yet i have faced it with a card of ten <eos> 'tis in my head to do my master good : i see no reason but supposed lucentio must get a father call'd 'supposed vincentio' and that's a wonder : fathers commonly do get their children but in this case of wooing a child shall get a sire if i fail not of my cunning <eos> lucentio : fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir : have you so soon forgot the entertainment her sister katharina welcomed you withal <eos> hortensio : but wrangling pedant this is the patroness of heavenly harmony : then give me leave to have prerogative and when in music we have spent an hour your lecture shall have leisure for as much <eos> lucentio : preposterous ass that never read so far to know the cause why music was ordain'd <eos> was it not to refresh the mind of man after his studies or his usual pain <eos> then give me leave to read philosophy and while i pause serve in your harmony <eos> hortensio : sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine <eos> bianca : why gentlemen you do me double wrong to strive for that which resteth in my choice : i am no breeching scholar in the schools i'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times but learn my lessons as i please myself <eos> and to cut off all strife here sit we down : take you your instrument play you the whiles his lecture will be done ere you have tuned <eos> hortensio : you'll leave his lecture when i am in tune <eos> lucentio : that will be never : tune your instrument <eos> bianca : where left we last <eos> lucentio : here madam : 'hic ibat simois hic est sigeia tellus hic steterat priami regia celsa senis <eos>' bianca : construe them <eos> lucentio : 'hic ibat' as i told you before 'simois' i am lucentio 'hic est' son unto vincentio of pisa 'sigeia tellus' disguised thus to get your love 'hic steterat' and that lucentio that comes a-wooing 'priami' is my man tranio 'regia' bearing my port 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon <eos> hortensio : madam my instrument's in tune <eos> bianca : let's hear <eos> o fie <eos> the treble jars <eos> lucentio : spit in the hole man and tune again <eos> bianca : now let me see if i can construe it : 'hic ibat simois' i know you not 'hic est sigeia tellus' i trust you not 'hic steterat priami' take heed he hear us not 'regia' presume not 'celsa senis' despair not <eos> hortensio : madam 'tis now in tune <eos> lucentio : all but the base <eos> hortensio : the base is right 'tis the base knave that jars <eos> how fiery and forward our pedant is <eos> now for my life the knave doth court my love : pedascule i'll watch you better yet <eos> bianca : in time i may believe yet i mistrust <eos> lucentio : mistrust it not : for sure aeacides was ajax call'd so from his grandfather <eos> bianca : i must believe my master else i promise you i should be arguing still upon that doubt : but let it rest <eos> now licio to you : good masters take it not unkindly pray that i have been thus pleasant with you both <eos> hortensio : you may go walk and give me leave a while : my lessons make no music in three parts <eos> lucentio : are you so formal sir <eos> well i must wait and watch withal for but i be deceived our fine musician groweth amorous <eos> hortensio : madam before you touch the instrument to learn the order of my fingering i must begin with rudiments of art to teach you gamut in a briefer sort more pleasant pithy and effectual than hath been taught by any of my trade : and there it is in writing fairly drawn <eos> bianca : why i am past my gamut long ago <eos> hortensio : yet read the gamut of hortensio <eos> bianca : servant : mistress your father prays you leave your books and help to dress your sister's chamber up : you know to-morrow is the wedding-day <eos> bianca : farewell sweet masters both i must be gone <eos> lucentio : faith mistress then i have no cause to stay <eos> hortensio : but i have cause to pry into this pedant : methinks he looks as though he were in love : yet if thy thoughts bianca be so humble to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale seize thee that list : if once i find thee ranging hortensio will be quit with thee by changing <eos> baptista : katharina : no shame but mine : i must forsooth be forced to give my hand opposed against my heart unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure <eos> i told you i he was a frantic fool hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior : and to be noted for a merry man he'll woo a thousand 'point the day of marriage make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd <eos> now must the world point at poor katharina and say 'lo there is mad petruchio's wife if it would please him come and marry her <eos>' tranio : patience good katharina and baptista too <eos> upon my life petruchio means but well whatever fortune stays him from his word : though he be blunt i know him passing wise though he be merry yet withal he's honest <eos> katharina : would katharina had never seen him though <eos> baptista : go girl i cannot blame thee now to weep for such an injury would vex a very saint much more a shrew of thy impatient humour <eos> biondello : master master <eos> news old news and such news as you never heard of <eos> baptista : is it new and old too <eos> how may that be <eos> biondello : why is it not news to hear of petruchio's coming <eos> baptista : is he come <eos> biondello : why no sir <eos> baptista : what then <eos> biondello : he is coming <eos> baptista : when will he be here <eos> biondello : when he stands where i am and sees you there <eos> tranio : but say what to thine old news <eos> biondello : why petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair of boots that have been candle-cases one buckled another laced an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town-armory with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points : his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten near-legged before and with a half-chequed bit and a head-stall of sheeps leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthread <eos> baptista : who comes with him <eos> biondello : o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and 'the humour of forty fancies' pricked in't for a feather : a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey <eos> tranio : 'tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd <eos> baptista : i am glad he's come howsoe'er he comes <eos> biondello : why sir he comes not <eos> baptista : didst thou not say he comes <eos> biondello : who <eos> that petruchio came <eos> baptista : ay that petruchio came <eos> biondello : no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back <eos> baptista : why that's all one <eos> biondello : nay by saint jamy i hold you a penny a horse and a man is more than one and yet not many <eos> petruchio : come where be these gallants <eos> who's at home <eos> baptista : you are welcome sir <eos> petruchio : and yet i come not well <eos> baptista : and yet you halt not <eos> tranio : not so well apparell'd as i wish you were <eos> petruchio : were it better i should rush in thus <eos> but where is kate <eos> where is my lovely bride <eos> how does my father <eos> gentles methinks you frown : and wherefore gaze this goodly company as if they saw some wondrous monument some comet or unusual prodigy <eos> baptista : why sir you know this is your wedding-day : first were we sad fearing you would not come now sadder that you come so unprovided <eos> fie doff this habit shame to your estate an eye-sore to our solemn festival <eos> tranio : and tells us what occasion of import hath all so long detain'd you from your wife and sent you hither so unlike yourself <eos> petruchio : tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear : sufficeth i am come to keep my word though in some part enforced to digress which at more leisure i will so excuse as you shall well be satisfied withal <eos> but where is kate <eos> i stay too long from her : the morning wears 'tis time we were at church <eos> tranio : see not your bride in these unreverent robes : go to my chamber put on clothes of mine <eos> petruchio : not i believe me : thus i'll visit her <eos> baptista : but thus i trust you will not marry her <eos> petruchio : good sooth even thus therefore ha' done with words : to me she's married not unto my clothes : could i repair what she will wear in me as i can change these poor accoutrements 'twere well for kate and better for myself <eos> but what a fool am i to chat with you when i should bid good morrow to my bride and seal the title with a lovely kiss <eos> tranio : he hath some meaning in his mad attire : we will persuade him be it possible to put on better ere he go to church <eos> baptista : i'll after him and see the event of this <eos> tranio : but to her love concerneth us to add her father's liking : which to bring to pass as i before unparted to your worship i am to get a man <eos>whate'er he be it skills not much <eos> we'll fit him to our turn <eos> and he shall be vincentio of pisa and make assurance here in padua of greater sums than i have promised <eos> so shall you quietly enjoy your hope and marry sweet bianca with consent <eos> lucentio : were it not that my fellow-school-master doth watch bianca's steps so narrowly 'twere good methinks to steal our marriage which once perform'd let all the world say no i'll keep mine own despite of all the world <eos> tranio : that by degrees we mean to look into and watch our vantage in this business : we'll over-reach the greybeard gremio the narrow-prying father minola the quaint musician amorous licio all for my master's sake lucentio <eos> signior gremio came you from the church <eos> gremio : as willingly as e'er i came from school <eos> tranio : and is the bride and bridegroom coming home <eos> gremio : a bridegroom say you <eos> 'tis a groom indeed a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find <eos> tranio : curster than she <eos> why 'tis impossible <eos> gremio : why he's a devil a devil a very fiend <eos> tranio : why she's a devil a devil the devil's dam <eos> gremio : tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him <eos> i'll tell you sir lucentio : when the priest should ask if katharina should be his wife 'ay by gogs-wouns' quoth he and swore so loud that all-amazed the priest let fall the book and as he stoop'd again to take it up the mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff that down fell priest and book and book and priest : 'now take them up' quoth he 'if any list <eos>' tranio : what said the wench when he rose again <eos> gremio : trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore as if the vicar meant to cozen him <eos> but after many ceremonies done he calls for wine : 'a health <eos>' quoth he as if he had been aboard carousing to his mates after a storm quaff'd off the muscadel and threw the sops all in the sexton's face having no other reason but that his beard grew thin and hungerly and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking <eos> this done he took the bride about the neck and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack that at the parting all the church did echo : and i seeing this came thence for very shame and after me i know the rout is coming <eos> such a mad marriage never was before : hark hark <eos> i hear the minstrels play <eos> petruchio : gentlemen and friends i thank you for your pains : i know you think to dine with me to-day and have prepared great store of wedding cheer but so it is my haste doth call me hence and therefore here i mean to take my leave <eos> baptista : is't possible you will away to-night <eos> petruchio : i must away to-day before night come : make it no wonder if you knew my business you would entreat me rather go than stay <eos> and honest company i thank you all that have beheld me give away myself to this most patient sweet and virtuous wife : dine with my father drink a health to me for i must hence and farewell to you all <eos> tranio : let us entreat you stay till after dinner <eos> petruchio : it may not be <eos> gremio : let me entreat you <eos> petruchio : it cannot be <eos> katharina : let me entreat you <eos> petruchio : i am content <eos> katharina : are you content to stay <eos> petruchio : i am content you shall entreat me stay but yet not stay entreat me how you can <eos> katharina : now if you love me stay <eos> petruchio : grumio my horse <eos> grumio : ay sir they be ready : the oats have eaten the horses <eos> katharina : nay then do what thou canst i will not go to-day no nor to-morrow not till i please myself <eos> the door is open sir there lies your way you may be jogging whiles your boots are green for me i'll not be gone till i please myself : 'tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom that take it on you at the first so roundly <eos> petruchio : o kate content thee prithee be not angry <eos> katharina : i will be angry : what hast thou to do <eos> father be quiet he shall stay my leisure <eos> gremio : ay marry sir now it begins to work <eos> katarina : gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner : i see a woman may be made a fool if she had not a spirit to resist <eos> petruchio : they shall go forward kate at thy command <eos> obey the bride you that attend on her go to the feast revel and domineer carouse full measure to her maidenhead be mad and merry or go hang yourselves : but for my bonny kate she must with me <eos> nay look not big nor stamp nor stare nor fret i will be master of what is mine own : she is my goods my chattels she is my house my household stuff my field my barn my horse my ox my ass my any thing and here she stands touch her whoever dare i'll bring mine action on the proudest he that stops my way in padua <eos> grumio draw forth thy weapon we are beset with thieves rescue thy mistress if thou be a man <eos> fear not sweet wench they shall not touch thee kate : i'll buckler thee against a million <eos> baptista : nay let them go a couple of quiet ones <eos> gremio : went they not quickly i should die with laughing <eos> tranio : of all mad matches never was the like <eos> lucentio : mistress what's your opinion of your sister <eos> bianca : that being mad herself she's madly mated <eos> gremio : i warrant him petruchio is kated <eos> baptista : neighbours and friends though bride and bridegroom wants for to supply the places at the table you know there wants no junkets at the feast <eos> lucentio you shall supply the bridegroom's place : and let bianca take her sister's room <eos> tranio : shall sweet bianca practise how to bride it <eos> baptista : she shall lucentio <eos> come gentlemen let's go <eos> grumio : fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and all foul ways <eos> was ever man so beaten <eos> was ever man so rayed <eos> was ever man so weary <eos> i am sent before to make a fire and they are coming after to warm them <eos> now were not i a little pot and soon hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my belly ere i should come by a fire to thaw me : but i with blowing the fire shall warm myself for considering the weather a taller man than i will take cold <eos> holla ho <eos> curtis <eos> curtis : who is that calls so coldly <eos> grumio : a piece of ice : if thou doubt it thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck <eos> a fire good curtis <eos> curtis : is my master and his wife coming grumio <eos> grumio : o ay curtis ay : and therefore fire fire cast on no water <eos> curtis : is she so hot a shrew as she's reported <eos> grumio : she was good curtis before this frost : but thou knowest winter tames man woman and beast for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself fellow curtis <eos> curtis : away you three-inch fool <eos> i am no beast <eos> grumio : am i but three inches <eos> why thy horn is a foot and so long am i at the least <eos> but wilt thou make a fire or shall i complain on thee to our mistress whose hand she being now at hand thou shalt soon feel to thy cold comfort for being slow in thy hot office <eos> curtis : i prithee good grumio tell me how goes the world <eos> grumio : a cold world curtis in every office but thine and therefore fire : do thy duty and have thy duty for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death <eos> curtis : there's fire ready and therefore good grumio the news <eos> grumio : why 'jack boy <eos> ho <eos> boy <eos>' and as much news as will thaw <eos> curtis : come you are so full of cony-catching <eos> grumio : why therefore fire for i have caught extreme cold <eos> where's the cook <eos> is supper ready the house trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept the serving-men in their new fustian their white stockings and every officer his wedding-garment on <eos> be the jacks fair within the jills fair without the carpets laid and every thing in order <eos> curtis : all ready and therefore i pray thee news <eos> grumio : first know my horse is tired my master and mistress fallen out <eos> curtis : how <eos> grumio : out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a tale <eos> curtis : let's ha't good grumio <eos> grumio : lend thine ear <eos> curtis : here <eos> grumio : there <eos> curtis : this is to feel a tale not to hear a tale <eos> grumio : and therefore 'tis called a sensible tale : and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening <eos> now i begin : imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress <eos> curtis : both of one horse <eos> grumio : what's that to thee <eos> curtis : why a horse <eos> grumio : tell thou the tale : but hadst thou not crossed me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place how she was bemoiled how he left her with the horse upon her how he beat me because her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed that never prayed before how i cried how the horses ran away how her bridle was burst how i lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion and thou return unexperienced to thy grave <eos> curtis : by this reckoning he is more shrew than she <eos> grumio : ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home <eos> but what talk i of this <eos> call forth nathaniel joseph nicholas philip walter sugarsop and the rest : let their heads be sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their garters of an indifferent knit : let them curtsy with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their hands <eos> are they all ready <eos> curtis : they are <eos> grumio : call them forth <eos> curtis : do you hear ho <eos> you must meet my master to countenance my mistress <eos> grumio : why she hath a face of her own <eos> curtis : who knows not that <eos> grumio : thou it seems that calls for company to countenance her <eos> curtis :

<eos> petruchio : here sir <eos> here sir <eos> here sir <eos> here sir <eos> you logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms <eos> what no attendance <eos> no regard <eos> no duty <eos> where is the foolish knave i sent before <eos> grumio : here sir as foolish as i was before <eos> petruchio : you peasant swain <eos> you whoreson malt-horse drudge <eos> did i not bid thee meet me in the park and bring along these rascal knaves with thee <eos> grumio : nathaniel's coat sir was not fully made and gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel there was no link to colour peter's hat and walter's dagger was not come from sheathing : there were none fine but adam ralph and gregory the rest were ragged old and beggarly yet as they are here are they come to meet you <eos> petruchio : go rascals go and fetch my supper in <eos> where is the life that late i led <eos> where are those <eos>sit down kate and welcome <eos> <eos> sound sound sound sound <eos> why when i say <eos> nay good sweet kate be merry <eos> off with my boots you rogues <eos> you villains when <eos> it was the friar of orders grey as he forth walked on his way : <eos> out you rogue <eos> you pluck my foot awry : take that and mend the plucking off the other <eos> be merry kate <eos> some water here what ho <eos> where's my spaniel troilus <eos> sirrah get you hence and bid my cousin ferdinand come hither : one kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with <eos> where are my slippers <eos> shall i have some water <eos> come kate and wash and welcome heartily <eos> you whoreson villain <eos> will you let it fall <eos> katharina : patience i pray you 'twas a fault unwilling <eos> petruchio : a whoreson beetle-headed flap-ear'd knave <eos> come kate sit down i know you have a stomach <eos> will you give thanks sweet kate or else shall i <eos> what's this <eos> mutton <eos> first servant : ay <eos> petruchio : who brought it <eos> peter : i <eos> petruchio : 'tis burnt and so is all the meat <eos> what dogs are these <eos> where is the rascal cook <eos> how durst you villains bring it from the dresser and serve it thus to me that love it not <eos> theretake it to you trenchers cups and all you heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves <eos> what do you grumble <eos> i'll be with you straight <eos> katharina : i pray you husband be not so disquiet : the meat was well if you were so contented <eos> petruchio : i tell thee kate 'twas burnt and dried away and i expressly am forbid to touch it for it engenders choler planteth anger and better 'twere that both of us did fast since of ourselves ourselves are choleric than feed it with such over-roasted flesh <eos> be patient to-morrow 't shall be mended and for this night we'll fast for company : come i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber <eos> nathaniel : peter didst ever see the like <eos> peter : he kills her in her own humour <eos> grumio : where is he <eos> curtis : in her chamber making a sermon of continency to her and rails and swears and rates that she poor soul knows not which way to stand to look to speak and sits as one new-risen from a dream <eos> away away <eos> for he is coming hither <eos> petruchio : thus have i politicly begun my reign and 'tis my hope to end successfully <eos> my falcon now is sharp and passing empty and till she stoop she must not be full-gorged for then she never looks upon her lure <eos> another way i have to man my haggard to make her come and know her keeper's call that is to watch her as we watch these kites that bate and beat and will not be obedient <eos> she eat no meat to-day nor none shall eat last night she slept not nor to-night she shall not as with the meat some undeserved fault i'll find about the making of the bed and here i'll fling the pillow there the bolster this way the coverlet another way the sheets : ay and amid this hurly i intend that all is done in reverend care of her and in conclusion she shall watch all night : and if she chance to nod i'll rail and brawl and with the clamour keep her still awake <eos> this is a way to kill a wife with kindness and thus i'll curb her mad and headstrong humour <eos> he that knows better how to tame a shrew now let him speak : 'tis charity to show <eos> tranio : is't possible friend licio that mistress bianca doth fancy any other but lucentio <eos> i tell you sir she bears me fair in hand <eos> hortensio : sir to satisfy you in what i have said stand by and mark the manner of his teaching <eos> lucentio : now mistress profit you in what you read <eos> bianca : what master read you <eos> first resolve me that <eos> lucentio : i read that i profess the art to love <eos> bianca : and may you prove sir master of your art <eos> lucentio : while you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart <eos> hortensio : quick proceeders marry <eos> now tell me i pray you that durst swear at your mistress bianca loved none in the world so well as lucentio <eos> tranio : o despiteful love <eos> unconstant womankind <eos> i tell thee licio this is wonderful <eos> hortensio : mistake no more : i am not licio nor a musician as i seem to be but one that scorn to live in this disguise for such a one as leaves a gentleman and makes a god of such a cullion : know sir that i am call'd hortensio <eos> tranio : signior hortensio i have often heard of your entire affection to bianca and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness i will with you if you be so contented forswear bianca and her love for ever <eos> hortensio : see how they kiss and court <eos> signior lucentio here is my hand and here i firmly vow never to woo her no more but do forswear her as one unworthy all the former favours that i have fondly flatter'd her withal <eos> tranio : and here i take the unfeigned oath never to marry with her though she would entreat : fie on her <eos> see how beastly she doth court him <eos> hortensio : would all the world but he had quite forsworn <eos> for me that i may surely keep mine oath i will be married to a wealthy widow ere three days pass which hath as long loved me as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard <eos> and so farewell signior lucentio <eos> kindness in women not their beauteous looks shall win my love : and so i take my leave in resolution as i swore before <eos> tranio : mistress bianca bless you with such grace as 'longeth to a lover's blessed case <eos> nay i have ta'en you napping gentle love and have forsworn you with hortensio <eos> bianca : tranio you jest : but have you both forsworn me <eos> tranio : mistress we have <eos> lucentio : then we are rid of licio <eos> tranio : i' faith he'll have a lusty widow now that shall be wood and wedded in a day <eos> bianca : god give him joy <eos> tranio : ay and he'll tame her <eos> bianca : he says so tranio <eos> tranio : faith he is gone unto the taming-school <eos> bianca : the taming-school <eos> what is there such a place <eos> tranio : ay mistress and petruchio is the master that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue <eos> biondello : o master master i have watch'd so long that i am dog-weary : but at last i spied an ancient angel coming down the hill will serve the turn <eos> tranio : what is he biondello <eos> biondello : master a mercatante or a pedant i know not what but format in apparel in gait and countenance surely like a father <eos> lucentio : and what of him tranio <eos> tranio : if he be credulous and trust my tale i'll make him glad to seem vincentio and give assurance to baptista minola as if he were the right vincentio take in your love and then let me alone <eos> pedant : god save you sir <eos> tranio : and you sir <eos> you are welcome <eos> travel you far on or are you at the farthest <eos> pedant : sir at the farthest for a week or two : but then up farther and as for as rome and so to tripoli if god lend me life <eos> tranio : what countryman i pray <eos> pedant : of mantua <eos> tranio : of mantua sir <eos> marry god forbid <eos> and come to padua careless of your life <eos> pedant : my life sir <eos> how i pray <eos> for that goes hard <eos> tranio : 'tis death for any one in mantua to come to padua <eos> know you not the cause <eos> your ships are stay'd at venice and the duke for private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly : 'tis marvel but that you are but newly come you might have heard it else proclaim'd about <eos> pedant : alas <eos> sir it is worse for me than so for i have bills for money by exchange from florence and must here deliver them <eos> tranio : well sir to do you courtesy this will i do and this i will advise you : first tell me have you ever been at pisa <eos> pedant : ay sir in pisa have i often been pisa renowned for grave citizens <eos> tranio : among them know you one vincentio <eos> pedant : i know him not but i have heard of him a merchant of incomparable wealth <eos> tranio : he is my father sir and sooth to say in countenance somewhat doth resemble you <eos> biondello : tranio : to save your life in this extremity this favour will i do you for his sake and think it not the worst of an your fortunes that you are like to sir vincentio <eos> his name and credit shall you undertake and in my house you shall be friendly lodged : look that you take upon you as you should you understand me sir : so shall you stay till you have done your business in the city : if this be courtesy sir accept of it <eos> pedant : o sir i do and will repute you ever the patron of my life and liberty <eos> tranio : then go with me to make the matter good <eos> this by the way i let you understand my father is here look'd for every day to pass assurance of a dower in marriage 'twixt me and one baptista's daughter here : in all these circumstances i'll instruct you : go with me to clothe you as becomes you <eos> grumio : no no forsooth i dare not for my life <eos> katharina : the more my wrong the more his spite appears : what did he marry me to famish me <eos> beggars that come unto my father's door upon entreaty have a present aims if not elsewhere they meet with charity : but i who never knew how to entreat nor never needed that i should entreat am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep with oath kept waking and with brawling fed : and that which spites me more than all these wants he does it under name of perfect love as who should say if i should sleep or eat 'twere deadly sickness or else present death <eos> i prithee go and get me some repast i care not what so it be wholesome food <eos> grumio : what say you to a neat's foot <eos> katharina : 'tis passing good : i prithee let me have it <eos> grumio : i fear it is too choleric a meat <eos> how say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd <eos> katharina : i like it well : good grumio fetch it me <eos> grumio : i cannot tell i fear 'tis choleric <eos> what say you to a piece of beef and mustard <eos> katharina : a dish that i do love to feed upon <eos> grumio : ay but the mustard is too hot a little <eos> katharina : why then the beef and let the mustard rest <eos> grumio : nay then i will not : you shall have the mustard or else you get no beef of grumio <eos> katharina : then both or one or any thing thou wilt <eos> grumio : why then the mustard without the beef <eos> katharina : go get thee gone thou false deluding slave that feed'st me with the very name of meat : sorrow on thee and all the pack of you that triumph thus upon my misery <eos> go get thee gone i say <eos> petruchio : how fares my kate <eos> what sweeting all amort <eos> hortensio : mistress what cheer <eos> katharina : faith as cold as can be <eos> petruchio : pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me <eos> here love thou see'st how diligent i am to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee : i am sure sweet kate this kindness merits thanks <eos> what not a word <eos> nay then thou lovest it not and all my pains is sorted to no proof <eos> here take away this dish <eos> katharina : i pray you let it stand <eos> petruchio : the poorest service is repaid with thanks and so shall mine before you touch the meat <eos> katharina : i thank you sir <eos> hortensio : signior petruchio fie <eos> you are to blame <eos> come mistress kate i'll bear you company <eos> petruchio : haberdasher : here is the cap your worship did bespeak <eos> petruchio : why this was moulded on a porringer a velvet dish : fie fie <eos> 'tis lewd and filthy : why 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell a knack a toy a trick a baby's cap : away with it <eos> come let me have a bigger <eos> katharina : i'll have no bigger : this doth fit the time and gentlewomen wear such caps as these petruchio : when you are gentle you shall have one too and not till then <eos> hortensio : katharina : why sir i trust i may have leave to speak and speak i will i am no child no babe : your betters have endured me say my mind and if you cannot best you stop your ears <eos> my tongue will tell the anger of my heart or else my heart concealing it will break and rather than it shall i will be free even to the uttermost as i please in words <eos> petruchio : why thou say'st true it is a paltry cap a custard-coffin a bauble a silken pie : i love thee well in that thou likest it not <eos> katharina : love me or love me not i like the cap and it i will have or i will have none <eos> petruchio : thy gown <eos> why ay : come tailor let us see't <eos> o mercy god <eos> what masquing stuff is here <eos> what's this <eos> a sleeve <eos> 'tis like a demi-cannon : what up and down carved like an apple-tart <eos> here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash like to a censer in a barber's shop : why what i' devil's name tailor call'st thou this <eos> hortensio : tailor : you bid me make it orderly and well according to the fashion and the time <eos> petruchio : marry and did but if you be remember'd i did not bid you mar it to the time <eos> go hop me over every kennel home for you shall hop without my custom sir : i'll none of it : hence <eos> make your best of it <eos> katharina : i never saw a better-fashion'd gown more quaint more pleasing nor more commendable : belike you mean to make a puppet of me <eos> petruchio : why true he means to make a puppet of thee <eos> tailor : she says your worship means to make a puppet of her <eos> petruchio : o monstrous arrogance <eos> thou liest thou thread thou thimble thou yard three-quarters half-yard quarter nail <eos> thou flea thou nit thou winter-cricket thou <eos> braved in mine own house with a skein of thread <eos> away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant or i shall so be-mete thee with thy yard as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest <eos> i tell thee i that thou hast marr'd her gown <eos> tailor : your worship is deceived the gown is made just as my master had direction : grumio gave order how it should be done <eos> grumio : i gave him no order i gave him the stuff <eos> tailor : but how did you desire it should be made <eos> grumio : marry sir with needle and thread <eos> tailor : but did you not request to have it cut <eos> grumio : thou hast faced many things <eos> tailor : i have <eos> grumio : face not me : thou hast braved many men brave not me i will neither be faced nor braved <eos> i say unto thee i bid thy master cut out the gown but i did not bid him cut it to pieces : ergo thou liest <eos> tailor : why here is the note of the fashion to testify petruchio : read it <eos> grumio : the note lies in's throat if he say i said so <eos> tailor : grumio : master if ever i said loose-bodied gown sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread : i said a gown <eos> petruchio : proceed <eos> tailor : grumio : i confess the cape <eos> tailor : grumio : i confess two sleeves <eos> tailor : petruchio : ay there's the villany <eos> grumio : error i' the bill sir error i' the bill <eos> i commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again and that i'll prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble <eos> tailor : this is true that i say : an i had thee in place where thou shouldst know it <eos> grumio : i am for thee straight : take thou the bill give me thy mete-yard and spare not me <eos> hortensio : god-a-mercy grumio <eos> then he shall have no odds <eos> petruchio : well sir in brief the gown is not for me <eos> grumio : you are i' the right sir : 'tis for my mistress <eos> petruchio : go take it up unto thy master's use <eos> grumio : villain not for thy life : take up my mistress' gown for thy master's use <eos> petruchio : why sir what's your conceit in that <eos> grumio : o sir the conceit is deeper than you think for : take up my mistress' gown to his master's use <eos> o fie fie fie <eos> petruchio : hortensio : tailor i'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow : take no unkindness of his hasty words : away <eos> i say commend me to thy master <eos> petruchio : well come my kate we will unto your father's even in these honest mean habiliments : our purses shall be proud our garments poor for 'tis the mind that makes the body rich and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds so honour peereth in the meanest habit <eos> what is the jay more precious than the lark because his fathers are more beautiful <eos> or is the adder better than the eel because his painted skin contents the eye <eos> o no good kate neither art thou the worse for this poor furniture and mean array <eos> if thou account'st it shame <eos> lay it on me and therefore frolic : we will hence forthwith to feast and sport us at thy father's house <eos> go call my men and let us straight to him and bring our horses unto long-lane end there will we mount and thither walk on foot let's see i think 'tis now some seven o'clock and well we may come there by dinner-time <eos> katharina : i dare assure you sir 'tis almost two and 'twill be supper-time ere you come there <eos> petruchio : it shall be seven ere i go to horse : look what i speak or do or think to do you are still crossing it <eos> sirs let't alone : i will not go to-day and ere i do it shall be what o'clock i say it is <eos> hortensio : tranio : sir this is the house : please it you that i call <eos> pedant : ay what else <eos> and but i be deceived signior baptista may remember me near twenty years ago in genoa where we were lodgers at the pegasus <eos> tranio : 'tis well and hold your own in any case with such austerity as 'longeth to a father <eos> pedant : i warrant you <eos> but sir here comes your boy 'twere good he were school'd <eos> tranio : fear you not him <eos> sirrah biondello now do your duty throughly i advise you : imagine 'twere the right vincentio <eos> biondello : tut fear not me <eos> tranio : but hast thou done thy errand to baptista <eos> biondello : i told him that your father was at venice and that you look'd for him this day in padua <eos> tranio : thou'rt a tall fellow : hold thee that to drink <eos> here comes baptista : set your countenance sir <eos> signior baptista you are happily met <eos> sir this is the gentleman i told you of : i pray you stand good father to me now give me bianca for my patrimony <eos> pedant : soft son <eos> sir by your leave : having come to padua to gather in some debts my son lucentio made me acquainted with a weighty cause of love between your daughter and himself : and for the good report i hear of you and for the love he beareth to your daughter and she to him to stay him not too long i am content in a good father's care to have him match'd and if you please to like no worse than i upon some agreement me shall you find ready and willing with one consent to have her so bestow'd for curious i cannot be with you signior baptista of whom i hear so well <eos> baptista : sir pardon me in what i have to say : your plainness and your shortness please me well <eos> right true it is your son lucentio here doth love my daughter and she loveth him or both dissemble deeply their affections : and therefore if you say no more than this that like a father you will deal with him and pass my daughter a sufficient dower the match is made and all is done : your son shall have my daughter with consent <eos> tranio : i thank you sir <eos> where then do you know best we be affied and such assurance ta'en as shall with either part's agreement stand <eos> baptista : not in my house lucentio for you know pitchers have ears and i have many servants : besides old gremio is hearkening still and happily we might be interrupted <eos> tranio : then at my lodging an it like you : there doth my father lie and there this night we'll pass the business privately and well <eos> send for your daughter by your servant here : my boy shall fetch the scrivener presently <eos> the worst is this that at so slender warning you are like to have a thin and slender pittance <eos> baptista : it likes me well <eos> biondello hie you home and bid bianca make her ready straight and if you will tell what hath happened lucentio's father is arrived in padua and how she's like to be lucentio's wife <eos> biondello : i pray the gods she may with all my heart <eos> tranio : dally not with the gods but get thee gone <eos> signior baptista shall i lead the way <eos> welcome <eos> one mess is like to be your cheer : come sir we will better it in pisa <eos> baptista : i follow you <eos> biondello : cambio <eos> lucentio : what sayest thou biondello <eos> biondello : you saw my master wink and laugh upon you <eos> lucentio : biondello what of that <eos> biondello : faith nothing but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens <eos> lucentio : i pray thee moralize them <eos> biondello : then thus <eos> baptista is safe talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son <eos> lucentio : and what of him <eos> biondello : his daughter is to be brought by you to the supper <eos> lucentio : and then <eos> biondello : the old priest of saint luke's church is at your command at all hours <eos> lucentio : and what of all this <eos> biondello : i cannot tell expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance : take you assurance of her 'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum :' to the church take the priest clerk and some sufficient honest witnesses : if this be not that you look for i have no more to say but bid bianca farewell for ever and a day <eos> lucentio : hearest thou biondello <eos> biondello : i cannot tarry : i knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir : and so adieu sir <eos> my master hath appointed me to go to saint luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix <eos> lucentio : i may and will if she be so contented : she will be pleased then wherefore should i doubt <eos> hap what hap may i'll roundly go about her : it shall go hard if cambio go without her <eos> petruchio : come on i' god's name once more toward our father's <eos> good lord how bright and goodly shines the moon <eos> katharina : the moon <eos> the sun : it is not moonlight now <eos> petruchio : i say it is the moon that shines so bright <eos> katharina : i know it is the sun that shines so bright <eos> petruchio : now by my mother's son and that's myself it shall be moon or star or what i list or ere i journey to your father's house <eos> go on and fetch our horses back again <eos> evermore cross'd and cross'd nothing but cross'd <eos> hortensio : say as he says or we shall never go <eos> katharina : forward i pray since we have come so far and be it moon or sun or what you please : an if you please to call it a rush-candle henceforth i vow it shall be so for me <eos> petruchio : i say it is the moon <eos> katharina : i know it is the moon <eos> petruchio : nay then you lie : it is the blessed sun <eos> katharina : then god be bless'd it is the blessed sun : but sun it is not when you say it is not and the moon changes even as your mind <eos> what you will have it named even that it is and so it shall be so for katharina <eos> hortensio : petruchio go thy ways the field is won <eos> petruchio : well forward forward <eos> thus the bowl should run and not unluckily against the bias <eos> but soft <eos> company is coming here <eos> good morrow gentle mistress : where away <eos> tell me sweet kate and tell me truly too hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman <eos> such war of white and red within her cheeks <eos> what stars do spangle heaven with such beauty as those two eyes become that heavenly face <eos> fair lovely maid once more good day to thee <eos> sweet kate embrace her for her beauty's sake <eos> hortensio : a' will make the man mad to make a woman of him <eos> katharina : young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet whither away or where is thy abode <eos> happy the parents of so fair a child happier the man whom favourable stars allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow <eos> petruchio : why how now kate <eos> i hope thou art not mad : this is a man old wrinkled faded wither'd and not a maiden as thou say'st he is <eos> katharina : pardon old father my mistaking eyes that have been so bedazzled with the sun that everything i look on seemeth green : now i perceive thou art a reverend father pardon i pray thee for my mad mistaking <eos> petruchio : do good old grandsire and withal make known which way thou travellest : if along with us we shall be joyful of thy company <eos> vincentio : fair sir and you my merry mistress that with your strange encounter much amazed me my name is call'd vincentio my dwelling pisa and bound i am to padua there to visit a son of mine which long i have not seen <eos> petruchio : what is his name <eos> vincentio : lucentio gentle sir <eos> petruchio : happily we met the happier for thy son <eos> and now by law as well as reverend age i may entitle thee my loving father : the sister to my wife this gentlewoman thy son by this hath married <eos> wonder not nor be grieved : she is of good esteem her dowery wealthy and of worthy birth beside so qualified as may beseem the spouse of any noble gentleman <eos> let me embrace with old vincentio and wander we to see thy honest son who will of thy arrival be full joyous <eos> vincentio : but is it true <eos> or else is it your pleasure like pleasant travellers to break a jest upon the company you overtake <eos> hortensio : i do assure thee father so it is <eos> petruchio : come go along and see the truth hereof for our first merriment hath made thee jealous <eos> hortensio : well petruchio this has put me in heart <eos> have to my widow <eos> and if she be froward then hast thou taught hortensio to be untoward <eos> biondello : softly and swiftly sir for the priest is ready <eos> lucentio : i fly biondello : but they may chance to need thee at home therefore leave us <eos> biondello : nay faith i'll see the church o' your back and then come back to my master's as soon as i can <eos> gremio : i marvel cambio comes not all this while <eos> petruchio : sir here's the door this is lucentio's house : my father's bears more toward the market-place thither must i and here i leave you sir <eos> vincentio : you shall not choose but drink before you go : i think i shall command your welcome here and by all likelihood some cheer is toward <eos> gremio : they're busy within you were best knock louder <eos> pedant : what's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate <eos> vincentio : is signior lucentio within sir <eos> pedant : he's within sir but not to be spoken withal <eos> vincentio : what if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal <eos> pedant : keep your hundred pounds to yourself : he shall need none so long as i live <eos> petruchio : nay i told you your son was well beloved in padua <eos> do you hear sir <eos> to leave frivolous circumstances i pray you tell signior lucentio that his father is come from pisa and is here at the door to speak with him <eos> pedant : thou liest : his father is come from padua and here looking out at the window <eos> vincentio : art thou his father <eos> pedant : ay sir so his mother says if i may believe her <eos> petruchio : pedant : lay hands on the villain : i believe a' means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance <eos> biondello : i have seen them in the church together : god send 'em good shipping <eos> but who is here <eos> mine old master vincentio <eos> now we are undone and brought to nothing <eos> vincentio : biondello : hope i may choose sir <eos> vincentio : come hither you rogue <eos> what have you forgot me <eos> biondello : forgot you <eos> no sir : i could not forget you for i never saw you before in all my life <eos> vincentio : what you notorious villain didst thou never see thy master's father vincentio <eos> biondello : what my old worshipful old master <eos> yes marry sir : see where he looks out of the window <eos> vincentio : is't so indeed <eos> biondello : help help help <eos> here's a madman will murder me <eos> pedant : help son <eos> help signior baptista <eos> petruchio : prithee kate let's stand aside and see the end of this controversy <eos> tranio : sir what are you that offer to beat my servant <eos> vincentio : what am i sir <eos> nay what are you sir <eos> o immortal gods <eos> o fine villain <eos> a silken doublet <eos> a velvet hose <eos> a scarlet cloak <eos> and a copatain hat <eos> o i am undone <eos> i am undone <eos> while i play the good husband at home my son and my servant spend all at the university <eos> tranio : how now <eos> what's the matter <eos> baptista : what is the man lunatic <eos> tranio : sir you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit but your words show you a madman <eos> why sir what 'cerns it you if i wear pearl and gold <eos> i thank my good father i am able to maintain it <eos> vincentio : thy father <eos> o villain <eos> he is a sailmaker in bergamo <eos> baptista : you mistake sir you mistake sir <eos> pray what do you think is his name <eos> vincentio : his name <eos> as if i knew not his name : i have brought him up ever since he was three years old and his name is tranio <eos> pedant : away away mad ass <eos> his name is lucentio and he is mine only son and heir to the lands of me signior vincentio <eos> vincentio : lucentio <eos> o he hath murdered his master <eos> lay hold on him i charge you in the duke's name <eos> o my son my son <eos> tell me thou villain where is my son lucentio <eos> tranio : call forth an officer <eos> carry this mad knave to the gaol <eos> father baptista i charge you see that he be forthcoming <eos> vincentio : carry me to the gaol <eos> gremio : stay officer : he shall not go to prison <eos> baptista : talk not signior gremio : i say he shall go to prison <eos> gremio : take heed signior baptista lest you be cony-catched in this business : i dare swear this is the right vincentio <eos> pedant : swear if thou darest <eos> gremio : nay i dare not swear it <eos> tranio : then thou wert best say that i am not lucentio <eos> gremio : yes i know thee to be signior lucentio <eos> baptista : away with the dotard <eos> to the gaol with him <eos> vincentio : thus strangers may be hailed and abused : o monstrous villain <eos> biondello : o <eos> we are spoiled and <eos>yonder he is : deny him forswear him or else we are all undone <eos> lucentio : vincentio : lives my sweet son <eos> bianca : pardon dear father <eos> baptista : how hast thou offended <eos> where is lucentio <eos> lucentio : here's lucentio right son to the right vincentio that have by marriage made thy daughter mine while counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne <eos> gremio : here's packing with a witness to deceive us all <eos> vincentio : where is that damned villain tranio that faced and braved me in this matter so <eos> baptista : why tell me is not this my cambio <eos> bianca : cambio is changed into lucentio <eos> lucentio : love wrought these miracles <eos> bianca's love made me exchange my state with tranio while he did bear my countenance in the town and happily i have arrived at the last unto the wished haven of my bliss <eos> what tranio did myself enforced him to then pardon him sweet father for my sake <eos> vincentio : i'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the gaol <eos> baptista : but do you hear sir <eos> have you married my daughter without asking my good will <eos> vincentio : fear not baptista we will content you go to : but i will in to be revenged for this villany <eos> baptista : and i to sound the depth of this knavery <eos> lucentio : look not pale bianca thy father will not frown <eos> gremio : my cake is dough but i'll in among the rest out of hope of all but my share of the feast <eos> katharina : husband let's follow to see the end of this ado <eos> petruchio : first kiss me kate and we will <eos> katharina : what in the midst of the street <eos> petruchio : what art thou ashamed of me <eos> katharina : no sir god forbid but ashamed to kiss <eos> petruchio : why then let's home again <eos> come sirrah let's away <eos> katharina : nay i will give thee a kiss : now pray thee love stay <eos> petruchio : is not this well <eos> come my sweet kate : better once than never for never too late <eos> lucentio : at last though long our jarring notes agree : and time it is when raging war is done to smile at scapes and perils overblown <eos> my fair bianca bid my father welcome while i with self-same kindness welcome thine <eos> brother petruchio sister katharina and thou hortensio with thy loving widow feast with the best and welcome to my house : my banquet is to close our stomachs up after our great good cheer <eos> pray you sit down for now we sit to chat as well as eat <eos> petruchio : nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat <eos> baptista : padua affords this kindness son petruchio <eos> petruchio : padua affords nothing but what is kind <eos> hortensio : for both our sakes i would that word were true <eos> petruchio : now for my life hortensio fears his widow <eos> widow : then never trust me if i be afeard <eos> petruchio : you are very sensible and yet you miss my sense : i mean hortensio is afeard of you <eos> widow : he that is giddy thinks the world turns round <eos> petruchio : roundly replied <eos> katharina : mistress how mean you that <eos> widow : thus i conceive by him <eos> petruchio : conceives by me <eos> how likes hortensio that <eos> hortensio : my widow says thus she conceives her tale <eos> petruchio : very well mended <eos> kiss him for that good widow <eos> katharina : 'he that is giddy thinks the world turns round :' i pray you tell me what you meant by that <eos> widow : your husband being troubled with a shrew measures my husband's sorrow by his woe : and now you know my meaning katharina : a very mean meaning <eos> widow : right i mean you <eos> katharina : and i am mean indeed respecting you <eos> petruchio : to her kate <eos> hortensio : to her widow <eos> petruchio : a hundred marks my kate does put her down <eos> hortensio : that's my office <eos> petruchio : spoke like an officer ha' to thee lad <eos> baptista : how likes gremio these quick-witted folks <eos> gremio : believe me sir they butt together well <eos> bianca : head and butt <eos> an hasty-witted body would say your head and butt were head and horn <eos> vincentio : ay mistress bride hath that awaken'd you <eos> bianca : ay but not frighted me therefore i'll sleep again <eos> petruchio : nay that you shall not : since you have begun have at you for a bitter jest or two <eos> bianca : am i your bird <eos> i mean to shift my bush and then pursue me as you draw your bow <eos> you are welcome all <eos> petruchio : she hath prevented me <eos> here signior tranio <eos> this bird you aim'd at though you hit her not therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd <eos> tranio : o sir lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound which runs himself and catches for his master <eos> petruchio : a good swift simile but something currish <eos> tranio : 'tis well sir that you hunted for yourself : 'tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay <eos> baptista : o ho petruchio <eos> tranio hits you now <eos> lucentio : i thank thee for that gird good tranio <eos> hortensio : confess confess hath he not hit you here <eos> petruchio : a' has a little gall'd me i confess and as the jest did glance away from me 'tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright <eos> baptista : now in good sadness son petruchio i think thou hast the veriest shrew of all <eos> petruchio : well i say no : and therefore for assurance let's each one send unto his wife and he whose wife is most obedient to come at first when he doth send for her shall win the wager which we will propose <eos> hortensio : content <eos> what is the wager <eos> lucentio : twenty crowns <eos> petruchio : twenty crowns <eos> i'll venture so much of my hawk or hound but twenty times so much upon my wife <eos> lucentio : a hundred then <eos> hortensio : content <eos> petruchio : a match <eos> 'tis done <eos> hortensio : who shall begin <eos> lucentio : that will i <eos> go biondello bid your mistress come to me <eos> biondello : i go <eos> baptista : son i'll be your half bianca comes <eos> lucentio : i'll have no halves i'll bear it all myself <eos> how now <eos> what news <eos> biondello : sir my mistress sends you word that she is busy and she cannot come <eos> petruchio : how <eos> she is busy and she cannot come <eos> is that an answer <eos> gremio : ay and a kind one too : pray god sir your wife send you not a worse <eos> petruchio : i hope better <eos> hortensio : sirrah biondello go and entreat my wife to come to me forthwith <eos> petruchio : o ho <eos> entreat her <eos> nay then she must needs come <eos> hortensio : i am afraid sir do what you can yours will not be entreated <eos> now where's my wife <eos> biondello : she says you have some goodly jest in hand : she will not come : she bids you come to her <eos> petruchio : worse and worse she will not come <eos> o vile intolerable not to be endured <eos> sirrah grumio go to your mistress say i command her to come to me <eos> hortensio : i know her answer <eos> petruchio : what <eos> hortensio : she will not <eos> petruchio : the fouler fortune mine and there an end <eos> baptista : now by my holidame here comes katharina <eos> katharina : what is your will sir that you send for me <eos> petruchio : where is your sister and hortensio's wife <eos> katharina : they sit conferring by the parlor fire <eos> petruchio : go fetch them hither : if they deny to come <eos> swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands : away i say and bring them hither straight <eos> lucentio : here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder <eos> hortensio : and so it is : i wonder what it bodes <eos> petruchio : marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life and awful rule and right supremacy and to be short what not that's sweet and happy <eos> baptista : now fair befal thee good petruchio <eos> the wager thou hast won and i will add unto their losses twenty thousand crowns another dowry to another daughter for she is changed as she had never been <eos> petruchio : nay i will win my wager better yet and show more sign of her obedience her new-built virtue and obedience <eos> see where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion <eos> katharina that cap of yours becomes you not : off with that bauble throw it under-foot <eos> widow : lord let me never have a cause to sigh till i be brought to such a silly pass <eos> bianca : fie <eos> what a foolish duty call you this <eos> lucentio : i would your duty were as foolish too : the wisdom of your duty fair bianca hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time <eos> bianca : the more fool you for laying on my duty <eos> petruchio : katharina i charge thee tell these headstrong women what duty they do owe their lords and husbands <eos> widow : come come you're mocking : we will have no telling <eos> petruchio : come on i say and first begin with her <eos> widow : she shall not <eos> petruchio : i say she shall : and first begin with her <eos> katharina : fie fie <eos> unknit that threatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor : it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable <eos> a woman moved is like a fountain troubled muddy ill-seeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it <eos> thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt <eos> such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord <eos> i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey <eos> why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts <eos> come come you froward and unable worms <eos> my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are <eos> then vail your stomachs for it is no boot and place your hands below your husband's foot : in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him ease <eos> petruchio : why there's a wench <eos> come on and kiss me kate <eos> lucentio : well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't <eos> vincentio : 'tis a good hearing when children are toward <eos> lucentio : but a harsh hearing when women are froward <eos> petruchio : come kate we'll to bed <eos> we three are married but you two are sped <eos> 'twas i won the wager though you hit the white and being a winner god give you good night <eos> hortensio : now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew <eos> lucentio : 'tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so <eos> master : boatswain <eos> boatswain : here master : what cheer <eos> master : good speak to the mariners : fall to't yarely or we run ourselves aground : bestir bestir <eos> boatswain : heigh my hearts <eos> cheerly cheerly my hearts <eos> yare yare <eos> take in the topsail <eos> tend to the master's whistle <eos> blow till thou burst thy wind if room enough <eos> alonso : good boatswain have care <eos> where's the master <eos> play the men <eos> boatswain : i pray now keep below <eos> antonio : where is the master boatswain <eos> boatswain : do you not hear him <eos> you mar our labour : keep your cabins : you do assist the storm <eos> gonzalo : nay good be patient <eos> boatswain : when the sea is <eos> hence <eos> what cares these roarers for the name of king <eos> to cabin : silence <eos> trouble us not <eos> gonzalo : good yet remember whom thou hast aboard <eos> boatswain : none that i more love than myself <eos> you are a counsellor if you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present we will not hand a rope more use your authority : if you cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour if it so hap <eos> cheerly good hearts <eos> out of our way i say <eos> gonzalo : i have great comfort from this fellow : methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him his complexion is perfect gallows <eos> stand fast good fate to his hanging : make the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage <eos> if he be not born to be hanged our case is miserable <eos> boatswain : down with the topmast <eos> yare <eos> lower lower <eos> bring her to try with main-course <eos> a plague upon this howling <eos> they are louder than the weather or our office <eos> yet again <eos> what do you here <eos> shall we give o'er and drown <eos> have you a mind to sink <eos> sebastian : a pox o' your throat you bawling blasphemous incharitable dog <eos> boatswain : work you then <eos> antonio : hang cur <eos> hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker <eos> we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art <eos> gonzalo : i'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench <eos> boatswain : lay her a-hold a-hold <eos> set her two courses off to sea again lay her off <eos> mariners : all lost <eos> to prayers to prayers <eos> all lost <eos> boatswain : what must our mouths be cold <eos> gonzalo : the king and prince at prayers <eos> let's assist them for our case is as theirs <eos> sebastian : i'm out of patience <eos> antonio : we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards : this wide-chapp'd rascal <eos>would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides <eos> gonzalo : he'll be hang'd yet though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him <eos> antonio : let's all sink with the king <eos> sebastian : let's take leave of him <eos> gonzalo : now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any thing <eos> the wills above be done <eos> but i would fain die a dry death <eos> miranda : if by your art my dearest father you have put the wild waters in this roar allay them <eos> the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch but that the sea mounting to the welkin's cheek dashes the fire out <eos> o i have suffered with those that i saw suffer : a brave vessel who had no doubt some noble creature in her dash'd all to pieces <eos> o the cry did knock against my very heart <eos> poor souls they perish'd <eos> had i been any god of power i would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallow'd and the fraughting souls within her <eos> prospero : be collected : no more amazement : tell your piteous heart there's no harm done <eos> miranda : o woe the day <eos> prospero : no harm <eos> i have done nothing but in care of thee of thee my dear one thee my daughter who art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing of whence i am nor that i am more better than prospero master of a full poor cell and thy no greater father <eos> miranda : more to know did never meddle with my thoughts <eos> prospero : 'tis time i should inform thee farther <eos> lend thy hand and pluck my magic garment from me <eos> so : lie there my art <eos> wipe thou thine eyes have comfort <eos> the direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd the very virtue of compassion in thee i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul <eos> no not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink <eos> sit down for thou must now know farther <eos> miranda : you have often begun to tell me what i am but stopp'd and left me to a bootless inquisition concluding 'stay : not yet <eos>' prospero : the hour's now come the very minute bids thee ope thine ear obey and be attentive <eos> canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell <eos> i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not out three years old <eos> miranda : certainly sir i can <eos> prospero : by what <eos> by any other house or person <eos> of any thing the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance <eos> miranda : 'tis far off and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants <eos> had i not four or five women once that tended me <eos> prospero : thou hadst and more miranda <eos> but how is it that this lives in thy mind <eos> what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time <eos> if thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here how thou camest here thou mayst <eos> miranda : but that i do not <eos> prospero : twelve year since miranda twelve year since thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power <eos> miranda : sir are not you my father <eos> prospero : thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter and thy father was duke of milan and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued <eos> miranda : o the heavens <eos> what foul play had we that we came from thence <eos> or blessed was't we did <eos> prospero : both both my girl : by foul play as thou say'st were we heaved thence but blessedly holp hither <eos> miranda : o my heart bleeds to think o' the teen that i have turn'd you to which is from my remembrance <eos> please you farther <eos> prospero : my brother and thy uncle call'd antonio <eos> i pray thee mark me <eos>that a brother should be so perfidious <eos> <eos>he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies <eos> thy false uncle <eos> dost thou attend me <eos> miranda : sir most heedfully <eos> prospero : being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who to advance and who to trash for over-topping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed 'em or else new form'd 'em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i' the state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and suck'd my verdure out on't <eos> thou attend'st not <eos> miranda : o good sir i do <eos> prospero : i pray thee mark me <eos> i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired o'er-prized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound <eos> he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o' the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative : hence his ambition growing <eos> dost thou hear <eos> miranda : your tale sir would cure deafness <eos> prospero : to have no screen between this part he play'd and him he play'd it for he needs will be absolute milan <eos> me poor man my library was dukedom large enough : of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates <eos> so dry he was for sway <eos>wi' the king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbow'd <eos>alas poor milan <eos> <eos> to most ignoble stooping <eos> miranda : o the heavens <eos> prospero : mark his condition and the event then tell me if this might be a brother <eos> miranda : i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother : good wombs have borne bad sons <eos> prospero : now the condition <eos> the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit which was that he in lieu o' the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother : whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i' the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self <eos> miranda : alack for pity <eos> i not remembering how i cried out then will cry it o'er again : it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to't <eos> prospero : hear a little further and then i'll bring thee to the present business which now's upon's without the which this story were most impertinent <eos> miranda : wherefore did they not that hour destroy us <eos> prospero : well demanded wench : my tale provokes that question <eos> dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colours fairer painted their foul ends <eos> in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively had quit it : there they hoist us to cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong <eos> miranda : alack what trouble was i then to you <eos> prospero : o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me <eos> thou didst smile <eos> infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groan'd which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue <eos> miranda : how came we ashore <eos> prospero : by providence divine <eos> some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnish'd me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom <eos> miranda : would i might but ever see that man <eos> prospero : now i arise : sit still and hear the last of our sea-sorrow <eos> here in this island we arrived and here have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit than other princesses can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful <eos> miranda : heavens thank you for't <eos> and now i pray you sir for still 'tis beating in my mind your reason for raising this sea-storm <eos> prospero : know thus far forth <eos> by accident most strange bountiful fortune now my dear lady hath mine enemies brought to this shore and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star whose influence if now i court not but omit my fortunes will ever after droop <eos> here cease more questions : thou art inclined to sleep 'tis a good dulness and give it way : i know thou canst not choose <eos> come away servant come <eos> i am ready now <eos> approach my ariel come <eos> ariel : all hail great master <eos> grave sir hail <eos> i come to answer thy best pleasure be't to fly to swim to dive into the fire to ride on the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task ariel and all his quality <eos> prospero : hast thou spirit perform'd to point the tempest that i bade thee <eos> ariel : to every article <eos> i boarded the king's ship now on the beak now in the waist the deck in every cabin i flamed amazement : sometime i'ld divide and burn in many places on the topmast the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly then meet and join <eos> jove's lightnings the precursors o' the dreadful thunder-claps more momentary and sight-outrunning were not the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble yea his dread trident shake <eos> prospero : my brave spirit <eos> who was so firm so constant that this coil would not infect his reason <eos> ariel : not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and play'd some tricks of desperation <eos> all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel then all afire with me : the king's son ferdinand with hair up-staring <eos>then like reeds not hair <eos> was the first man that leap'd cried 'hell is empty and all the devils are here <eos>' prospero : why that's my spirit <eos> but was not this nigh shore <eos> ariel : close by my master <eos> prospero : but are they ariel safe <eos> ariel : not a hair perish'd on their sustaining garments not a blemish but fresher than before : and as thou badest me in troops i have dispersed them 'bout the isle <eos> the king's son have i landed by himself whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting his arms in this sad knot <eos> prospero : of the king's ship the mariners say how thou hast disposed and all the rest o' the fleet <eos> ariel : safely in harbour is the king's ship in the deep nook where once thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew from the still-vex'd bermoothes there she's hid : the mariners all under hatches stow'd who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour i have left asleep and for the rest o' the fleet which i dispersed they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean flote bound sadly home for naples supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd and his great person perish <eos> prospero : ariel thy charge exactly is perform'd : but there's more work <eos> what is the time o' the day <eos> ariel : past the mid season <eos> prospero : at least two glasses <eos> the time 'twixt six and now must by us both be spent most preciously <eos> ariel : is there more toil <eos> since thou dost give me pains let me remember thee what thou hast promised which is not yet perform'd me <eos> prospero : how now <eos> moody <eos> what is't thou canst demand <eos> ariel : my liberty <eos> prospero : before the time be out <eos> no more <eos> ariel : i prithee remember i have done thee worthy service told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served without or grudge or grumblings : thou didst promise to bate me a full year <eos> prospero : dost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee <eos> ariel : no <eos> prospero : thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep to run upon the sharp wind of the north to do me business in the veins o' the earth when it is baked with frost <eos> ariel : i do not sir <eos> prospero : thou liest malignant thing <eos> hast thou forgot the foul witch sycorax who with age and envy was grown into a hoop <eos> hast thou forgot her <eos> ariel : no sir <eos> prospero : thou hast <eos> where was she born <eos> speak tell me <eos> ariel : sir in argier <eos> prospero : o was she so <eos> i must once in a month recount what thou hast been which thou forget'st <eos> this damn'd witch sycorax for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing from argier thou know'st was banish'd : for one thing she did they would not take her life <eos> is not this true <eos> ariel : ay sir <eos> prospero : this blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child and here was left by the sailors <eos> thou my slave as thou report'st thyself wast then her servant and for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands refusing her grand hests she did confine thee by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage into a cloven pine within which rift imprison'd thou didst painfully remain a dozen years within which space she died and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill-wheels strike <eos> then was this island <eos> save for the son that she did litter here a freckled whelp hag-born <eos>not honour'd with a human shape <eos> ariel : yes caliban her son <eos> prospero : dull thing i say so he that caliban whom now i keep in service <eos> thou best know'st what torment i did find thee in thy groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of ever angry bears : it was a torment to lay upon the damn'd which sycorax could not again undo : it was mine art when i arrived and heard thee that made gape the pine and let thee out <eos> ariel : i thank thee master <eos> prospero : if thou more murmur'st i will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howl'd away twelve winters <eos> ariel : pardon master i will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently <eos> prospero : do so and after two days i will discharge thee <eos> ariel : that's my noble master <eos> what shall i do <eos> say what what shall i do <eos> prospero : go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea : be subject to no sight but thine and mine invisible to every eyeball else <eos> go take this shape and hither come in't : go hence with diligence <eos> awake dear heart awake <eos> thou hast slept well awake <eos> miranda : the strangeness of your story put heaviness in me <eos> prospero : shake it off <eos> come on we'll visit caliban my slave who never yields us kind answer <eos> miranda : 'tis a villain sir i do not love to look on <eos> prospero : but as 'tis we cannot miss him : he does make our fire fetch in our wood and serves in offices that profit us <eos> what ho <eos> slave <eos> caliban <eos> thou earth thou <eos> speak <eos> caliban : prospero : come forth i say <eos> there's other business for thee : come thou tortoise <eos> when <eos> fine apparition <eos> my quaint ariel hark in thine ear <eos> ariel : my lord it shall be done <eos> prospero : thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself upon thy wicked dam come forth <eos> caliban : as wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd with raven's feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both <eos> a south-west blow on ye and blister you all o'er <eos> prospero : for this be sure to-night thou shalt have cramps side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins shall for that vast of night that they may work all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging than bees that made 'em <eos> caliban : i must eat my dinner <eos> this island's mine by sycorax my mother which thou takest from me <eos> when thou camest first thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me water with berries in't and teach me how to name the bigger light and how the less that burn by day and night : and then i loved thee and show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle the fresh springs brine-pits barren place and fertile : cursed be i that did so <eos> all the charms of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you <eos> for i am all the subjects that you have which first was mine own king : and here you sty me in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me the rest o' the island <eos> prospero : thou most lying slave whom stripes may move not kindness <eos> i have used thee filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate the honour of my child <eos> caliban : o ho o ho <eos> would't had been done <eos> thou didst prevent me i had peopled else this isle with calibans <eos> prospero : abhorred slave which any print of goodness wilt not take being capable of all ill <eos> i pitied thee took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour one thing or other : when thou didst not savage know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like a thing most brutish i endow'd thy purposes with words that made them known <eos> but thy vile race though thou didst learn had that in't which good natures could not abide to be with therefore wast thou deservedly confined into this rock who hadst deserved more than a prison <eos> caliban : you taught me language and my profit on't is i know how to curse <eos> the red plague rid you for learning me your language <eos> prospero : hag-seed hence <eos> fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best to answer other business <eos> shrug'st thou malice <eos> if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly what i command i'll rack thee with old cramps fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din <eos> caliban : no pray thee <eos> i must obey : his art is of such power it would control my dam's god setebos and make a vassal of him <eos> prospero : so slave hence <eos> come unto these yellow sands and then take hands : courtsied when you have and kiss'd the wild waves whist foot it featly here and there and sweet sprites the burthen bear <eos> hark hark <eos> ferdinand : where should this music be <eos> i' the air or the earth <eos> it sounds no more : and sure it waits upon some god o' the island <eos> sitting on a bank weeping again the king my father's wreck this music crept by me upon the waters allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air : thence i have follow'd it or it hath drawn me rather <eos> but 'tis gone <eos> no it begins again <eos> full fathom five thy father lies of his bones are coral made those are pearls that were his eyes : nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a sea-change into something rich and strange <eos> sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell hark <eos> now i hear them <eos>ding-dong bell <eos> ferdinand : the ditty does remember my drown'd father <eos> this is no mortal business nor no sound that the earth owes <eos> i hear it now above me <eos> prospero : the fringed curtains of thine eye advance and say what thou seest yond <eos> miranda : what is't <eos> a spirit <eos> lord how it looks about <eos> believe me sir it carries a brave form <eos> but 'tis a spirit <eos> prospero : no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses as we have such <eos> this gallant which thou seest was in the wreck and but he's something stain'd with grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him a goodly person : he hath lost his fellows and strays about to find 'em <eos> miranda : i might call him a thing divine for nothing natural i ever saw so noble <eos> prospero : ferdinand : most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend <eos> vouchsafe my prayer may know if you remain upon this island and that you will some good instruction give how i may bear me here : my prime request which i do last pronounce is o you wonder <eos> if you be maid or no <eos> miranda : no wonder sir but certainly a maid <eos> ferdinand : my language <eos> heavens <eos> i am the best of them that speak this speech were i but where 'tis spoken <eos> prospero : how <eos> the best <eos> what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee <eos> ferdinand : a single thing as i am now that wonders to hear thee speak of naples <eos> he does hear me and that he does i weep : myself am naples who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld the king my father wreck'd <eos> miranda : alack for mercy <eos> ferdinand : yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan and his brave son being twain <eos> prospero : miranda : why speaks my father so ungently <eos> this is the third man that e'er i saw the first that e'er i sigh'd for : pity move my father to be inclined my way <eos> ferdinand : o if a virgin and your affection not gone forth i'll make you the queen of naples <eos> prospero : soft sir <eos> one word more <eos> they are both in either's powers but this swift business i must uneasy make lest too light winning make the prize light <eos> one word more i charge thee that thou attend me : thou dost here usurp the name thou owest not and hast put thyself upon this island as a spy to win it from me the lord on't <eos> ferdinand : no as i am a man <eos> miranda : there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple : if the ill spirit have so fair a house good things will strive to dwell with't <eos> prospero : follow me <eos> speak not you for him he's a traitor <eos> come i'll manacle thy neck and feet together : sea-water shalt thou drink thy food shall be the fresh-brook muscles wither'd roots and husks wherein the acorn cradled <eos> follow <eos> ferdinand : no i will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power <eos> miranda : o dear father make not too rash a trial of him for he's gentle and not fearful <eos> prospero : what <eos> i say my foot my tutor <eos> put thy sword up traitor who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience is so possess'd with guilt : come from thy ward for i can here disarm thee with this stick and make thy weapon drop <eos> miranda : beseech you father <eos> prospero : hence <eos> hang not on my garments <eos> miranda : sir have pity i'll be his surety <eos> prospero : silence <eos> one word more shall make me chide thee if not hate thee <eos> what <eos> an advocate for an imposter <eos> hush <eos> thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he having seen but him and caliban : foolish wench <eos> to the most of men this is a caliban and they to him are angels <eos> miranda : my affections are then most humble i have no ambition to see a goodlier man <eos> prospero : come on obey : thy nerves are in their infancy again and have no vigour in them <eos> ferdinand : so they are my spirits as in a dream are all bound up <eos> my father's loss the weakness which i feel the wreck of all my friends nor this man's threats to whom i am subdued are but light to me might i but through my prison once a day behold this maid : all corners else o' the earth let liberty make use of space enough have i in such a prison <eos> prospero : miranda : be of comfort my father's of a better nature sir than he appears by speech : this is unwonted which now came from him <eos> prospero : thou shalt be free as mountain winds : but then exactly do all points of my command <eos> ariel : to the syllable <eos> prospero : come follow <eos> speak not for him <eos> gonzalo : beseech you sir be merry you have cause so have we all of joy for our escape is much beyond our loss <eos> our hint of woe is common every day some sailor's wife the masters of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe but for the miracle i mean our preservation few in millions can speak like us : then wisely good sir weigh our sorrow with our comfort <eos> alonso : prithee peace <eos> sebastian : he receives comfort like cold porridge <eos> antonio : the visitor will not give him o'er so <eos> sebastian : look he's winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike <eos> gonzalo : sir <eos> sebastian : one : tell <eos> gonzalo : when every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd comes to the entertainer <eos> sebastian : a dollar <eos> gonzalo : dolour comes to him indeed : you have spoken truer than you purposed <eos> sebastian : you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should <eos> gonzalo : therefore my lord <eos> antonio : fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue <eos> alonso : i prithee spare <eos> gonzalo : well i have done : but yet <eos> sebastian : he will be talking <eos> antonio : which of he or adrian for a good wager first begins to crow <eos> sebastian : the old cock <eos> antonio : the cockerel <eos> sebastian : done <eos> the wager <eos> antonio : a laughter <eos> sebastian : a match <eos> adrian : though this island seem to be desert <eos> sebastian : ha ha ha <eos> so you're paid <eos> adrian : uninhabitable and almost inaccessible <eos> sebastian : yet <eos> adrian : yet <eos> antonio : he could not miss't <eos> adrian : it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance <eos> antonio : temperance was a delicate wench <eos> sebastian : ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered <eos> adrian : the air breathes upon us here most sweetly <eos> sebastian : as if it had lungs and rotten ones <eos> antonio : or as 'twere perfumed by a fen <eos> gonzalo : here is everything advantageous to life <eos> antonio : true save means to live <eos> sebastian : of that there's none or little <eos> gonzalo : how lush and lusty the grass looks <eos> how green <eos> antonio : the ground indeed is tawny <eos> sebastian : with an eye of green in't <eos> antonio : he misses not much <eos> sebastian : no he doth but mistake the truth totally <eos> gonzalo : but the rarity of it is <eos>which is indeed almost beyond credit <eos> sebastian : as many vouched rarities are <eos> gonzalo : that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water <eos> antonio : if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies <eos> sebastian : ay or very falsely pocket up his report gonzalo : methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis <eos> sebastian : 'twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return <eos> adrian : tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen <eos> gonzalo : not since widow dido's time <eos> antonio : widow <eos> a pox o' that <eos> how came that widow in <eos> widow dido <eos> sebastian : what if he had said 'widower aeneas' too <eos> good lord how you take it <eos> adrian : 'widow dido' said you <eos> you make me study of that : she was of carthage not of tunis <eos> gonzalo : this tunis sir was carthage <eos> adrian : carthage <eos> gonzalo : i assure you carthage <eos> sebastian : his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath raised the wall and houses too <eos> antonio : what impossible matter will he make easy next <eos> sebastian : i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple <eos> antonio : and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands <eos> gonzalo : ay <eos> antonio : why in good time <eos> gonzalo : sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queen <eos> antonio : and the rarest that e'er came there <eos> sebastian : bate i beseech you widow dido <eos> antonio : o widow dido <eos> ay widow dido <eos> gonzalo : is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it <eos> i mean in a sort <eos> antonio : that sort was well fished for <eos> gonzalo : when i wore it at your daughter's marriage <eos> alonso : you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense <eos> would i had never married my daughter there <eos> for coming thence my son is lost and in my rate she too who is so far from italy removed i ne'er again shall see her <eos> o thou mine heir of naples and of milan what strange fish hath made his meal on thee <eos> francisco : sir he may live : i saw him beat the surges under him and ride upon their backs he trod the water whose enmity he flung aside and breasted the surge most swoln that met him his bold head 'bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd himself with his good arms in lusty stroke to the shore that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd as stooping to relieve him : i not doubt he came alive to land <eos> alonso : no no he's gone <eos> sebastian : sir you may thank yourself for this great loss that would not bless our europe with your daughter but rather lose her to an african where she at least is banish'd from your eye who hath cause to wet the grief on't <eos> alonso : prithee peace <eos> sebastian : you were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise by all of us and the fair soul herself weigh'd between loathness and obedience at which end o' the beam should bow <eos> we have lost your son i fear for ever : milan and naples have more widows in them of this business' making than we bring men to comfort them : the fault's your own <eos> alonso : so is the dear'st o' the loss <eos> gonzalo : my lord sebastian the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in : you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster <eos> sebastian : very well <eos> antonio : and most chirurgeonly <eos> gonzalo : it is foul weather in us all good sir when you are cloudy <eos> sebastian : foul weather <eos> antonio : very foul <eos> gonzalo : had i plantation of this isle my lord <eos> antonio : he'ld sow't with nettle-seed <eos> sebastian : or docks or mallows <eos> gonzalo : and were the king on't what would i do <eos> sebastian : 'scape being drunk for want of wine <eos> gonzalo : i' the commonwealth i would by contraries execute all things for no kind of traffic would i admit no name of magistrate letters should not be known riches poverty and use of service none contract succession bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none no use of metal corn or wine or oil no occupation all men idle all and women too but innocent and pure no sovereignty <eos> sebastian : yet he would be king on't <eos> antonio : the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning <eos> gonzalo : all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavour : treason felony sword pike knife gun or need of any engine would i not have but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison all abundance to feed my innocent people <eos> sebastian : no marrying 'mong his subjects <eos> antonio : none man all idle : whores and knaves <eos> gonzalo : i would with such perfection govern sir to excel the golden age <eos> sebastian : god save his majesty <eos> antonio : long live gonzalo <eos> gonzalo : and <eos>do you mark me sir <eos> alonso : prithee no more : thou dost talk nothing to me <eos> gonzalo : i do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing <eos> antonio : 'twas you we laughed at <eos> gonzalo : who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you : so you may continue and laugh at nothing still <eos> antonio : what a blow was there given <eos> sebastian : an it had not fallen flat-long <eos> gonzalo : you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing <eos> sebastian : we would so and then go a bat-fowling <eos> antonio : nay good my lord be not angry <eos> gonzalo : no i warrant you i will not adventure my discretion so weakly <eos> will you laugh me asleep for i am very heavy <eos> antonio : go sleep and hear us <eos> alonso : what all so soon asleep <eos> i wish mine eyes would with themselves shut up my thoughts : i find they are inclined to do so <eos> sebastian : please you sir do not omit the heavy offer of it : it seldom visits sorrow when it doth it is a comforter <eos> antonio : we two my lord will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety <eos> alonso : thank you <eos> wondrous heavy <eos> sebastian : what a strange drowsiness possesses them <eos> antonio : it is the quality o' the climate <eos> sebastian : why doth it not then our eyelids sink <eos> i find not myself disposed to sleep <eos> antonio : nor i my spirits are nimble <eos> they fell together all as by consent they dropp'd as by a thunder-stroke <eos> what might worthy sebastian <eos> o what might <eos> <eos>no more : <eos> and yet me thinks i see it in thy face what thou shouldst be : the occasion speaks thee and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head <eos> sebastian : what art thou waking <eos> antonio : do you not hear me speak <eos> sebastian : i do and surely it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st out of thy sleep <eos> what is it thou didst say <eos> this is a strange repose to be asleep with eyes wide open standing speaking moving and yet so fast asleep <eos> antonio : noble sebastian thou let'st thy fortune sleep <eos>die rather wink'st whiles thou art waking <eos>\""
